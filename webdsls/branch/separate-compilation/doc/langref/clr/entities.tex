% For now, please have a look at the My First Web Application page, which provides a step-by-step tutorial and explains the essentials of defining entities.
% 
% Some stuff:
% 
%     entity EntityName [: SuperEntity] {
%       property :: Type (anno*) // for value properties
%       property2 -> EntityType // for references to other entities
%       property3 -> Set<EntityType> // one to many relationship
%       property4 <> Set<Entity> // composition
%     }
