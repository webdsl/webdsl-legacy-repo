% Expressions
% 
% literals
% A number of literals are supported:
% 
%     * Strings: "This is a string"
%     * Ints: 22
%     * Float: 8.3
%     * Boolean: true/false
%     * List: [<expression>, <expression>, ...]
%     * Empty list: List<Int>()
%     * Set: {<expression>, <expression>, ...}
%     * Empty set: Set<Int>()
%     * Null: null
% 
% operators
% The following operators are supported:
% 
%     * Addition (numeric types) and string concatenation: +
%     * Subtraction (numeric types): -
%     * Multiplication (numeric types): *
%     * Division (numeric types): /
%     * Modulus (integer type): %
%     * Casting (casts a variable as one of another type): as (example: 8 as Float)
% 
% binary operators
% 
%     * Equality: =
%     * Inequality: !=
%     * Bigger than: >
%     * Bigger than or equal to: >=
%     * Smaller than: <
%     * Smaller than or equal to: <=
%     * Instance of: is a (checks if a certain expression is of a certain type)
%     * Contained in collection: in (checks if a certain expression is contained in a collection)
%     * and: &&
%     * or: ||
%     * not: !
% 
% Example:
% 
%     if(!(b is a String) && (b in [8, 5] || b + 3 = 7)) {
%        // ...
%     }
% 
% variables
% Variables can be accessed by use of their identifiers and their properties using the . notation. Example: person.lastName
% 
% list comprehensions
% List comprehensions are a combination of mapping, filtering and sorting. Example:
% 
%     [e.title
%      for(e : BlogEntry in b.entries 
%          where e.created > date 
%          order by e.created desc)]
% 
% This expression returns all titles (e.title) from b.entries where the time created (e.created) is greater than a certain date, ordered by e.created in descending order. Both the where and order by clauses are optional. An ordering is either ascending (asc) or descending (desc).
