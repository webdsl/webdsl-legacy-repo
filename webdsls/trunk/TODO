* initialize the database via statements in the DSL

  - import and export of data to/from XML (?)

* support viewing and editing of associations

  - start with viewing of reference types, collections of
    value, composite, and reference types

  - when editing an object provide choice box for selecting
    objects for reference types; for example, to add
    authors to a publication, choose from existing Persons
    in the database; also provide an option to create a new
    object for the association, returning to the original
    edit afterwards (or at least making the association with
    the original object)

  - code for inline editing of value lists; generate a matrix
    with inputText fields; update the elements from this matrix
    (in first experiments it wasn't clear to me how to get this
    done using dataTable; the JSF book provides an example, but
    that requires actually programming the components in Java;
    it would seem that the DataModel(Selection) constructs of
    Seam should provide a solution for this (using 
    valueChangedListener on the input fields); one issue I
    encountered here is that it seems not possible to provide
    both a DataModelSelection and a DataModelSelectionIndex
    for the same DataModel)

* embed composite associations?

  - perform an analysis of entity declarations and find out
    which entities are always used in composites
    does hibernate support selective embedded entities?
    (that would mean that some objects for the type are in
     separate table and others are embedded in the rows
     of the parent objects)

* consider special syntax for special value types such
  as URLs and dates
  
  - but how important are constant values in application
    definitions?

* SQL queries in the DSL

  - developer-defined queries in the DSL

  - user-defined queries in the webapp (e.g., in a wiki page)

  - StringBorg in DSL and in generated code?

* how to configure the user interface?

  - have edit page of an object as a tab of its view?

    ----------------------------
    | View | Edit | Properties |
    ---------------------------------------------
    |                                           |

    View provides the presentation of the object, in Edit the object
    data can be modified, and Properties gives meta-data about the
    object (e.g., history, authors, permissions, etc.)

    Of course, these tabs should only be enabled for those with the
    right permissions. 

  - table based presentations are ok for edit forms, but too limited
    for view pages

  - choosing good default values for sizes of form elements (e.g.,
    textarea)

  - what is a good style for CSS

  - figure out skinnability features of ajax4jsf (?)

  - It would be attractive to compose the userinterface from
    components that represent a particular object view or edit.
    Then it would be straightforward to compose more complex
    UI windows from such components.

* access control and authorization

--------------------------------------------------------------------
DONE
--------------------------------------------------------------------

* make URL and Email builtin types

* refactor generator modules to a module per generated file
