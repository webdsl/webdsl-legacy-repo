When there is no domain model (not Entities), the code doesn't compile the pages because of a import xxx.domain.*; The solution would be to use only fully qualified class names throughout all generated code (so no more imports).

This generates invalid code if not used within a template:
----
list { for(x : Person) { listitem{ output(x) } } }
list { for(x: Person2) { listitem{ output(x) } } }
----

You HAVE to use templates otherwise constructions like the above don't work at all.
