-----+++ Abstract

The deployment of services --- sets of running programs that provide
some useful facility on a system or network --- is typically
implemented through a manual, time-consuming and error-prone process.
For instance, system administrators must deploy the necessary software
components, edit configuration files, start or stop processes, and so
on.  This is often done in an ad hoc style with no
reproducibility, violating proper configuration management practices.
In this paper we show that build management, software deployment and
service deployment can be integrated into a single formalism.  We do
this in the context of the Nix software deployment system, and show
that its advantages --- co-existence of versions and variants, atomic
upgrades and rollbacks, and component closure --- extend naturally to
service deployment.  The approach also elegantly extends to
distributed services.  In addition, we show that the Nix expression
language can simplify the implementation of crosscutting variation
points in services.
