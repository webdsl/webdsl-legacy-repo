K. Olmos and E. Visser. Strategies for source-to-source constant propagation. In B. Gramlich and S. Lucas, editors, Workshop on Reduction Strategies (WRS'02), Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science, Copenhagen, Denmark, 2002. Elsevier Science Publishers. (To appear).

*Abstract*

Data-flow optimizations are usually implemented on low-level
intermediate representations. This is not appropriate for
source-to-source optimizations, which reconstruct a source level
program after transformation.  In this paper we show how constant
propagation, a well known data-flow optimization problem, can be
implemented on abstract syntax trees in Stratego, a rewriting system
extended with programmable rewriting strategies for the control over
the application of rules and dynamic rewrite rules for the propagation
of information.
