Transformation systems consist of many aspects including
	  parsing, tree manipulation, and
	  pretty-printing. Reimplementation of components for all
	  aspects is expensive; reuse of existing components is
	  desirable.

	  This requires a format for the exchange of data between
	  components and availability of the source code of the
	  components such that modifications can be made if necessary.
