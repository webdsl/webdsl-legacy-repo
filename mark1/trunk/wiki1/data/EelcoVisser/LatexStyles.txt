----+++ Dir Package - Modularity for <nop>LaTeX

Download: http://www.cs.uu.nl/~visser/ftp/dir.shar

Description: The <em>dir</em> package is a small (La)TeX package that supports true modularity for <nop>LaTeX. It allows one to transparantly input a file in another directory without having to adapt all the inputs in the included file.

Usage: Put <code>\usepackage{dir}</code> in the preamble of your document. To input a (collection of) files in another directory: 
<verbatim>
  {\cd{/the/other/directory}
	 \input{file.ltx}}
</verbatim>
Due to the <code>\cd</code> command, all <code>\input<code>s will be relative to <code>/the/other/directory</code>.

Note: The above is the only documentation for the package.

----+++ EVPRES -- Document Class for Presentations

Download: http://www.cs.uu.nl/~visser/ftp/evpres-1.0.tar.gz

This is the EVPRES document class for the production of presentations in PDF. The class is essentialy a wrapper for the pdfscreen and texpower packages.
The class was inspired by a first experiment for using these packages by Piet van Oostrum. The class should be further parameterized to adapt it to personal styles. Feedback is welcome.

(Completely obsolete; use the beamer latex class)
