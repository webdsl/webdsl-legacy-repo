--------+ A Transformation Factory for Digital Signal Processing Software

----++ Summary

		  The current practice of hand coding DSP software based on a
		  specification is time consuming and error-prone. Furthermore,
		  it leads to software that is hard to maintain and reuse.  A
		  critical factor for selling embedded processors is the
		  availability of programming tools.

		  The DSP software production problem can be alleviated by
		  producing implementation code <em>automatically</em> from its
		  specification by means of a series of transformations.  In
		  this approach the currently implicit implementation knowledge
		  is formalized in a large set of transformation rules, which
		  forms a better basis for maintainance and reuse.

		  In order to make the DSP implementations maintainable it is
		  crucial that the transformation system itself can easily be
		  adapted. Stratego is a language for the specification of
		  program transformation systems that has been designed to make
		  the specification of transformation systems themselves
		  maintainable and adaptable through the separation of rules and
		  strategies.

		  In this project we will investigate the feasibility of the
		  approach by developing implementations for a number of
		  realistic DSP case studies that will be provided by Philips
		  Research Laboratories.  The result of the research will be a
		  factory for DSP software consisting of a domain-specific
		  language for the specification of DSP problems and a library
		  of program transformations applicable in the DSP domain.
