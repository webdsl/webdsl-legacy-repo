*Abstract*

		  Stratego is a language for the specification of transformation
		  rules and strategies for applying them.  The basic actions of
		  transformations are matching and building instantiations of
		  first-order term patterns.  The language supports concise
		  formulation of generic and data type-specific term traversals.
		  One of the unusual features of Stratego is the separation of
		  scope from matching, allowing sharing of variables through
		  traversals.  The combination of first-order patterns with
		  strategies forms an expressive formalism for pattern matching.
		  In this paper we discuss three examples of _strategic pattern matching_: (1) ContextualRules allow matching
		  and replacement of a pattern at an arbitrary depth of a
		  subterm of the root pattern.  (2) [[Recursive patterns]]
		  can be used to characterize concisely the structure of
		  languages that form a restriction of a larger language. (3)
		  [[OverlayDefinitions][Overlays]] serve to hide the representation of a language
		  in another (more generic) language.  These techniques are
		  illustrated by means of specifications in Stratego.
