*Abstract*

	User-definable strategies for the application of rewrite rules
	provide a means to construct transformation systems that apply
	rewrite rules in a controlled way. This paper describes a
	strategy language and its interpretation.  The language is
	used to control the rewriting of terms using labeled rewrite
	rules. Rule labels are atomic strategies. Compound strategies
	are formed by means of sequential composition,
	non-deterministic choice, sequential choice, fixed point
	recursion, and a primitive for expressing term traversal.  The
	traversal primitive called `push-down' applies a strategy to
	all arguments of the outermost function symbol of a
	term. Several complex term traversal strategies such as
	bottom-up and top-down application and (parallel) innermost
	and (parallel) outermost reduction can be defined in terms of
	this primitive.  The paper contains two case studies of the
	application of strategies.
