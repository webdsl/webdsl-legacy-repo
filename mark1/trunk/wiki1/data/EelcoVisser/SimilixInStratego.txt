Similix is a partial evaluator for a Lisp-like language.

----+++ Goals

The goal of this project is to implement the partial evaluator for Similix in Stratego.

ResearchInterests questions

	* Does formulation of partial evaluation using separate rules and strategies make implementation of partial evaluation more reusable, maintainable, and readable?

	* Does such an implementation scale up to application of partial evaluation of large programs?
