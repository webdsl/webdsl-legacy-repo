--------++++ Abstract

		  In meta-programming with concrete object syntax, object-level
		  programs are composed from fragments written in concrete
		  syntax. The use of small program fragments in such quotations
		  and the use of meta-level expressions within these fragments
		  (anti-quotation) often lead to ambiguities. This problem is
		  usually solved through explicit disambiguation, resulting in
		  considerable syntactic overhead.  A few systems manage to
		  reduce this overhead by using type information during
		  parsing. Since this is hard to achieve with traditional
		  parsing technology, these systems provide specific
		  combinations of meta- and object-languages, and their
		  implementations are difficult to reuse.

		  In this paper, we generalize these approaches and present a
		  _language independent_ method for introducing concrete
		  object syntax without explicit disambiguation.  The method
		  uses scannerless generalized-LR parsing to parse meta-programs
		  with embedded object-level fragments, which produces a forest
		  of all possible parses. This forest is reduced to a tree by a
		  disambiguating typechecker for the meta-language.  To validate
		  our method we have developed embeddings of several object
		  languages in Java, including <nop>AspectJ and Java itself.
