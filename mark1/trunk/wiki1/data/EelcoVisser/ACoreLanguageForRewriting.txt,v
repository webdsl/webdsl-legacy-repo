*Abstract*

		  System S is a calculus providing the basic abstractions of
		  term rewriting: matching and building terms, term traversal,
		  combining computations and handling failure.  The calculus
		  forms a core language for implementation of a wide variety of
		  rewriting languages, or more generally, languages for
		  specifying tree transformations.  In this paper we show how a
		  conventional rewriting language based on conditional term
		  rewriting can be implemented straightforwardly in System S.
		  Subsequently we show how this implementation can be extended
		  with features such as matching conditions, negative
		  conditions, default rules, non-strictness annotations and
		  alternative evaluation strategies.
