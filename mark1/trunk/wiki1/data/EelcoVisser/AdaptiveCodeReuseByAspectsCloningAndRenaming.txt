-------+++ Abstract

		  Effective code reuse is desirable, but difficult to achieve in
		  practice, since it is often necessary to adapt code before it can be
		  reused successfully.  The good old solution to code reuse is simple:
		  copy, paste, then edit as needed.  This is a brilliant idea, except
		  for the maintenance problems it causes. In this paper we introduce
		  a language extension for declaratively performing adaptive code
		  reuse at compile-time. We decompose reuse into two operations;
		  clone existing code, and adapt it to new requirements.
		  The clone and adapt technique allows flexible code reuse, untangled
		  from subtyping and other irrelevant features, and without the
		  maintenance nightmare of copy and paste programming.
