Paper: '[[ComposingSourceToSourceDataFlowTransformations][Composing Source-to-Source Data-Flow Transformations with Rewriting Strategies and Dependent Dynamic Rewrite Rules]]' describes the composition of source-to-source data-flow transformations in the program transformation language Stratego. The language supports the high-level specification of transformations by means of rewriting strategy combinators that allow a natural modeling of data- and control-flow without committing to a specific source language. Data-flow facts are propagated using dynamic rewriting rules. In particular, we introduce the concept of dependent dynamic rewrite rules, for modeling the dependencies of data-flow facts on program entitities such as variables. The approach supports the combination of analysis and transformation, the combination of multiple transformations, the combination with other types of transformations, and the correct treatment of variable binding constructs and lexical scope to avoid variable capture.

The paper has been accepted for publication in the proceedings of CC'05, the 14th international conference on Compiler Construction in Edinburgh.

[[http://khason.biz/blog/2004/12/why-microsoft-can-blow-off-with-c.html][Proof]] that Stratego has a real chance at becoming a succesful language.

*2004-12-04*

Paper: '[[Program Transformation With Scoped Dynamic Rewrite Rules]]' describes the new design of dynamic rewrite rules including scope labels, extended dynamic rules, and union and intersection of rulesets. It has been conditionally accepted for inclusion to the special issue on program transformation of Fundamenta Informaticae.

During the after-OOPSLA/GPCE-conference-beer Tijs van der Storm challenged me to write a program that prints its
own source in Stratego. That was not too hard of course, but getting the quotes right is tricky. Here
it is:

<verbatim>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
module quine imports lib strategies main = !["module quine imports 
lib strategies main = ![\"","\"]; \\ [x, y] -> [x, <escape>x,
 \"\\\",\\\"\", <escape>y, y] \\; concat-strings; <print>(stdout
, [<id>]); <exit> 0"]; \ [x, y] -> [x, <escape>x, "\",\"", <escape>y, y] \; 
concat-strings; <print>(stdout, [<id>]); <exit> 0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
</verbatim>

I wrote a little educational [[http://www.stratego-language.org/Stratego/QuineInStratego][reconstruction of the design process]].

There are some further challenges here. The above program uses strings for code generation, which
is against everything we stand for of course. So the next thing to do is write a program which uses
concrete syntax to produce a syntax tree for its own source and then pretty-prints it. Another one
is a program that prints its own source _and_ compiles it. Calling XTC components is allowed of course;-)

Back from Vancouver and a good conference.

*2004-10-18*

Springer published the [[http://www.program-transformation.org/Gpce/ConferenceProceedings][conference proceedings]] of [[http://www.program-transformation.org/GPCE][GPCE 2004]] online.

Of course we will also present our paper on [[Concrete Syntax for Objects]] next week at OOPSLA (on Thursday to be precise). If you are close to Utrecht this week and not in Vancouver next week you might consider attending Martin's rehearsal at the [[Stc.WebHome][Software Technology Colloquium]] this Thursday.

Karina Olmos and I finished a paper on definition of data-flow optimizations with dependent dynamic rules. It is not available publicly yet, but if you are interested and present good arguments, we may let you have a peek.

*2004-10-14*

[[Martin.WebHome][Martin Bravenboer]] and I are going to state that the world needs [[Reusable and Adaptable Strategies for Generative Programming]] next week at the [[http://www.program-transformation.org/Gpce/STS][Software Transformation Systems Workshop]] of [[http://www.program-transformation.org/GPCE][GPCE'04]] in Vancouver. In fact _dependent dynamic rules_ 
are a step in the right direction since it is a generic mechanism that allows higher level specification of data-flow transformations without restricting applications to a fixed language or semantic model. (Now you are really becoming intrigued what those new dynamic rules are ...)

Just when I thought my [[http://www.program-transformation.org/GPCE][GPCE]] tour of duty was over, [[http://www.disi.unige.it/person/MoggiE/][Eugenio Moggi]] asked me to be publicity chair for GPCE'05. So you better get ready to write a generative paper for GPCE next year. It will be co-located with ICFP. 

*2004-10-12*

Today was my birthday and it was well spent writing a paper. Gifts are always welcome. High on the wish list are Stratego applications (toy, but preferably ready for deployment), new components for the Stratego compiler (I may have some specific ideas if necessary), a typechecker (for Stratego), and some grant money (or a lot even).

*2004-10-11*

Apparently I am a [[http://www.stratego-language.org/Stratego/StrategoBloggers][Stratego blogger]] and I have to [[http://mbravenboer.blogspot.com/2004/10/research-and-blogging.html][blog more]]. I'll do my best, here goes ...

Dependent dynamic rules are a cool (that's a good blog word isn't it)  generative extension of the basic dynamic rules in StrategoXT. Dependent dynamic rules kill themselves if you tell them to and also behave well under lexical scope so to avoid free variable capture. A complete common-subexpression elimination transformation component for Tiger (based on a generic data-flow traversal) is defined in 29 lines, of which 13 are empty lines and module header and such overhead. Excited? Read more about it in our upcoming paper.

Actually if you want to stay up to date, or check if the Stratego project is alive, read the viewcvs `blog' in the [[https://svn.cs.uu.nl:12443/repoman/info/StrategoXT][Stratego/XT subversion repository]].

*2004-02-17*

Finished revisions of papers `[[Retrofitting the AutoBayes Program Synthesis System with Concrete Syntax]]' and `[[Program Transformation with StrategoXT]]' for the book on the Dagstuhl meeting about '[[http://www.dagstuhl.de/03131][Domain-Specific Program Generation]]'.

Updated [[PublicationsByYear][publication list]] for 2003 including a technical report with a new version of the paper on [[http://www.stratego-language.org/Stratego/FusingLogicAndControl][Fusing Logic and Control]]

With [[http://www.cs.uu.nl/staff/karina.html][Karina Olmos]] I found out that data-flow optimizations with dynamic rules can be further improved by employing `self'-destructive rules.

*2004-02-10*

At the [[http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/projects/refactor-fp/workshop.html][Functional Refactoring Workshop]] in Kent I gave a talk about [[http://www.cs.uu.nl/~visser/ftp/FRW04-slides.pdf][Implementation of Partial Evaluation in Stratego/XT]]. For the demonstration I developed a primitive emacs mode for Tiger with menus for applying various transformations. It is quite easy to make Stratego transformations interactively usable.
