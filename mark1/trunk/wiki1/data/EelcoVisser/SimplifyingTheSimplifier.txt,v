------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---+++ Project Description

The simplifier of the GHC performs optimizations by applying a number of small transformation rules iteratively to the abstract syntax tree of a program.
The simplifier is implemented as one big Haskell module. 
The implementation is not modular and is difficult to change. 
Small changes lead to a big difference in optimization behaviour.
It is not possible to make different versions of the simplifier re-using the same basic code.
In addition, GHC has introduced user-definable optimization rules that can be specified by the
user as pragmas in the program. 
The design of the simplifier, however, suggests a modular set-up that is based on a number of separate transformation rules that are combined into one transformation. (source: [[http://research.microsoft.com/users/simonpj][Simon Peyton Jones]])

This suggests that the Stratego approach of defining transformations
as a set of transformation rules combined with a strategy that applies these rules would be advantageous to the implementation of the simplifier.
The goal of this project is to develop a modular implementation of the GHC simplifier in Stratego.
The goal is not to just replicate the GHC simplifier, but to explore the possibilities of Stratego
in implementing it, possibly leading to a family of simplifiers. 
The result should be evaluated against the following questions:
 
	* Correctness
		* Is it possible to replicate the behaviour of the simplier?
 
	* Is the result a readable specification of simplification?
 
	* Modularity: Is it possible to
		* Create different configurations or strategies based on the same set of rules
		* Vary the rules used?
		* Vary the command-line options (e.g., inlining heuristics) to simplifier?
		* Add user-defined optimization rules
 
	* Performance
		* What is complexity of the simplifier?
		* Does it scale up?

		  The goal of this project is to implement the GHC simplifier in

		  - can it be done?
d46 22
a67 13
		  - can it be done modularly?
 
		  - readable?
 
		  - is it posssible to create several configurations /
		  strategies based on the same set of rules / vary the rules
		  used / vary the options (e.g., inlining heuristics)
 
		  - efficient?
 
					 - does it scale up?
 
					 - what is complexity?
