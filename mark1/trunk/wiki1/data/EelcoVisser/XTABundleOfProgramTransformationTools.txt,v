*XT: a bundle of program transformation tools.*
In Tools.MarkVanDenBrand and Transform.DidierPerigot, editors, 
_Workshop on Language Descriptions, Tools and Applications (LDTA'01)_, 
volume 44 of 
_Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science_. 
Elsevier Science Publishers, April 2001.

*Abstract*

XT bundles existing and newly developed program transformation
libraries and tools into an open framework that supports
component-based development of program transformations. We discuss the
roles of XT's constituents in the development process of program
transformation tools, as well as some experiences with building
program transformation systems with XT.
