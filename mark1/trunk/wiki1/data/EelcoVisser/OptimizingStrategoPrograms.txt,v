----+++ Description

Stratego programs are composed from highly generic components (e.g., a generic traversal combined
with a set of rules). This allows the definition of a library of powerful combinators that can be reused in many circumstances (e.g., topdown, collect, innermost). However, in some cases the price for this generality is paid in run-time performance. 

The goal of this project is to find optimizations for Stratego programs.

----+++ Project

	* Compose a set of benchmark programs, candidates include
		* implode-asfix
		* pretty-printing components from GPP

	* Analyze the run-time behaviour of these programs, e.g., by profiling

	* Find bottlenecks in performance and analyze the cause
		* Bad translation by the compiler
		* Lack of knowledge by the compiler due to genericity

	* Design and implement optimizations (possibly in the form of CompilerPlugins)

----+++ ResearchInterests Questions

	* What determines the performance of strategies?

	* Can optimizations be implemented as CompilerPlugins separately from other optimizations?

----+++ Resources / Literature

	* Source of the Stratego:StrategoCompiler (obtain from Stratego:StrategoDownload)
	* Stratego:StrategoPublications
		* innermost optimization
	* Stratego:StrategoOptimization
