----++ H-number

The [[http://xxx.arxiv.org/PS_cache/physics/pdf/0508/0508025.pdf][h-number]] of E. Visser according to [[http://scholar.google.com][Google Scholar]]:

	* April 20, 2006: 18 (max citations = 129)

This number was obtained with a manual count of [[http://scholar.google.nl/scholar?num=100&hl=nl&lr=&q=E+Visser&btnG=Zoeken&as_subj=eng][this google query]].
H-numbers can also be computed (approximated) automatically using the [[http://www.brics.dk/~mis/hnumber.html][H-number'O'matic]] web interface.
This method is not accurate when the author name overlaps with that of other authors in the field.
The following [[http://www.brics.dk/cgi-mis/hnumber?name=E+Visser&words=Utrecht+Portland+Amsterdam][query]], which
corresponds with this [[http://scholar.google.nl/scholar?as_q=Eelco+Visser&num=100&btnG=Zoeken+in+Wetenschap&as_epq=&as_oq=Utrecht+Portland+Amsterdam&as_eq=&as_occt=any&as_sauthors=&as_publication=&as_ylo=&as_yhi=&as_allsubj=some&as_subj=eng&hl=nl&lr=][Google query]] results in h-number 16. With the more lenient [[http://www.brics.dk/cgi-mis/hnumber?name=E.+Visser&words=][E. Visser query]] the H-number'O'matic scripts returns 20. 
It turns out that two of the 20 are articles with other Visser co-authors. The restriction of the query above is too strict again.

Here a table with the development of my h-index over time:

| *date*			  | *h (omatic)* | *max citations* | *m (omatic)*  | *h (manual)* | *m (manual)*  | *h (omatic lenient)* |
| April 20, 2006	| 16			  | 129				 |					| *18*			| *145%* (1995) | 20						 |
| January 13, 2007 | 23			  | 138				 | 127% (1990)	| *21*			| *191%* (1995) | 39 (177)				 |

Notes:
	* the omatic result is obtained by the query name=E+Visser&words=Utrecht+Portland+Amsterdam (this should at some point start including Delft)
	* the omatic script wrongly sets my first publication in 1990; my first publication in DBLP is from 1995
	* the manual number is obtained by taking the top h entries from a google scholar query that actually refer to my publications

Observations:
	* the manual and omatic number (using the right constraint words) are close enough to give a rough indication; however, the lenient  query (just E. Visser and no additional constraints) gives a number that is much too high.
