------+++ Abstract

The transformation language Stratego provides high-level abstractions
for implementation of a wide range of transformations.  Our aim is to
integrate transformation in the software development process and make
it available to programmers.  This requires the transformations
provided by the programming environment to be extensible.  This paper
presents a case study in the implementation of extensible programming
environments using Stratego, by developing a small collection of
language extensions and several typical transformations for these
languages.
