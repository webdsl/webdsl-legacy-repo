-----+++ Abstract

		  Properties such as logging, persistence, debugging, tracing, distribution,
		  performance monitoring and exception handling occur in most programming
		  paradigms and are normally very difficult or even impossible to modularize
		  with traditional modularization mechanisms because they are cross-cutting.
		  Recently, aspect-oriented programming has enjoyed recognition as a practical
		  solution for separating these concerns. In this paper we describe an extension
		  to the Stratego term rewriting language for capturing such properties. We show
		  our aspect language offers a concise, practical and adaptable solution for
		  dealing with unanticipated algorithm extension for forward data-flow propagation
		  and dynamic type checking of terms. We briefly discuss some of the challenges
		  faced when designing and implementing an aspect extension for and in a
		  rule-based term rewriting system.
