I'm married to [[Janine Mets]] and father of [[Jelle Visser][Jelle]] and [[Bente Sofie]]. We live in Amersfoort.

I work at <a href="http://www.cs.uu.nl" target="_top">Utrecht University</a> as a computer scientist. My research is in the area of programming languages and software engineering. I have designed two computer languages, <a href="http://www.syntax-definition.org" target="_top">SDF2</a> and <a href="http://www.stratego-language.org" target="_top">Stratego</a>, and done some other stuff. See my <a href="http://www.cs.uu.nl/~visser" target="_top">homepage</a> for publications and other information.
