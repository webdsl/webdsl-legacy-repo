<a href="http://www.program-transformation.org"> <img src="http://www.program-transformation.org/twiki/pub/transformation.gif" align=right border=0 alt ="Program-Transformation.Org"> </a> 
Program transformation has applications in many areas of software engineering including compilation, optimization, refactoring, program synthesis, software renovation, and reverse engineering.  The aim of program transformation is to increase programmer productivity by automating programming tasks, thus enabling programming at a higher-level of abstraction, and increasing maintainability and re-usability. 

Many systems for program transformation exist that are often
	  specialized for a specific object language and/or kind of
	  transformation.  All these systems share many ideas about
	  program transformation and use similar techniques, but are
	  often ad-hoc in many respects.  The goal of my research is
	  to achieve a specification language or family of
	  specification languages for the high-level, declarative
	  specification of program transformation systems in which
	  generic, language independent schemas of transformation can
	  be captured, and which admits efficient implementation of
	  those transformations that can scale up to large programs.

----++++ Tools

This research is guided by the design and implementation of tools for aspects of the transformation process

	* [[Stratego]]: term rewriting and rewriting strategies
	* [[Syntax definition]]: declarative specification of syntax of languages
	* [[XT]]: bundling of transformation tools

-----++++ Applications

Validation of these tools is done by constructing transformation systems for all kinds of application domains

	* [[Dsp Transformation]]

-----++++ Surveys

The [[http://www.program-transformation.org][program transformation wiki]] is a collaborative web site created for surveying the wide area of program transformation. _[[http://www.program-transformation.org/Transform/ReengineeringWikiPaper][The Reengineering Wiki]]_ is a paper about the reengineering part of the transformation wiki that explains the ideas behind the wiki.
