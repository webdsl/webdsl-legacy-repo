    <h2>SAX 1.0 Overview</h2><div><p> <em> This information was included with the
SAX 1.0 distribution.
In SAX 2.0, the structure and concepts remained
largely the same, although several key interfaces
changed incompatibly.
</em> </p>

<p> The SAX 1.0 Java distribution contains eleven core classes and interfaces
together with three optional helper classes and five demonstration
classes, but don't let these overwhelm you: there are only three
interfaces that SAX parser writers need to implement, and while there
are five interfaces available for application writers, simple XML
applications will need only one or two of them.  </p>

<p> These SAX classes and interfaces fall into five groups: </p>

<dl>

<dt> interfaces implemented by the parser</dt><dd> Parser and AttributeList
  (required), and Locator (optional) </dd>

<dt> interfaces implemented by the application</dt><dd> DocumentHandler,
  ErrorHandler, DTDHandler, and EntityResolver (all optional:
  DocumentHandler will the most important one for typical XML
  applications)</dd>

<dt> standard SAX classes</dt><dd> InputSource, SAXException, SAXParseException,
  HandlerBase (these are all fully implemented by SAX)</dd>

<dt> optional Java-specific helper classes in the org.xml.sax.helpers
  package</dt><dd> ParserFactory, AttributeListImpl, and LocatorImpl (these
  are all fully implemented by the SAX Java distribution)</dd>

<dt> Java demonstration classes in the nul package</dt><dd> SystemIdDemo,
  ByteStreamDemo, CharacterStreamDemo, and EntityDemo, all of which
  can be run as Java applications; there is also a DemoHandler class
  that all four share</dd>

</dl>

<h3> Interfaces for Parser Writers (org.xml.sax package)</h3>

<p> A SAX-conformant XML parser needs to implement only two or three
simple interfaces; in fact, it is even possible (and quite common) to
implement all of these interfaces in a single class (often called
something like as `SAXDriver') if desired.  </p>

<dl>

<dt> Parser</dt>

<dd>
  This is the main interface to a SAX parser: it allows the user to
  register handlers for callbacks, to set the locale for error
  reporting, and to start an XML parse.
</dd>

<dt> AttributeList</dt>

<dd>
  This simple interface allows users to iterate through an attribute
  list -- the parser can implement it in the same class as the SAX
  driver, or implement it in a separate class (it does not need to be
  persistent).  There is a convenience implementation available in the
  org.xml.sax.helpers.AttributeListImpl.
</dd>

<dt> Locator</dt>

<dd>
  This simple interface allows users to find the current location in
  the XML source document -- the parser can implement it in the same
  class as the driver, or implement it in a second class (it does not
  need to be persistent).
</dd>

</dl>

<h3> Interfaces for Application Writers (org.xml.sax package)</h3>

<p> A SAX application may implement any or none of the following
interfaces, as required (simple XML applications may need only
DocumentHandler and possibly ErrorHandler).  </p>

<p> An application can implement all of these interfaces in a single
class, if desired.  </p>

<dl>
<dt> DocumentHandler</dt>

<dd>
  This is the interface that applications will probably use the most
  -- in many cases, it is the only one that they will need to
  implement.  If an application provides an implementation of this
  interface, it will receive notification of basic document-related
  events like the start and end of elements.
</dd>

<dt> ErrorHandler</dt>

<dd>
  If an application needs to use special error handling, then it must
  provide an implementation of this interface.
</dd>

<dt> DTDHandler</dt>

<dd>
  If an application needs to work with notations and unparsed (binary)
  entities, it must implement this interface to receive notification
  of the NOTATION and ENTITY declarations.
</dd>

<dt> EntityResolver</dt>

<dd>
  If an application needs to do redirection of URIs in documents (or
  other types of custom handling), it must provide an implementation
  of this interface.
</dd>

</dl>

<h3> Standard SAX Classes (org.xml.sax package) </h3>

<p> SAX consists mostly of interfaces rather than classes, but the
interfaces refer to two standard exception classes, and a third is
provided for universal convenience.  </p>

<p> These classes are useful for both parser and application writers.
</p>

<dl>
<dt> InputSource</dt>

<dd>
  This class contains all of the necessary information for a single
  input source, including a public identifier, system identifier, byte
  stream, and character stream (as appropriate).  The application must
  instantiate at least one InputSource for the Parser, and the
  EntityHandler may instantiate others.
</dd>

<dt> SAXException</dt>
  
<dd>
  This class represents a general SAX exception.
</dd>

<dt> SAXParseException</dt>

<dd>
  This class represents a SAX exception tied to a specific point in an
  XML source document.
</dd>

<dt> HandlerBase</dt>

<dd>
  This class provides default implementations for DocumentHandler,
  ErrorHandler, DTDHandler, and EntityResolver: parser writers can use
  this to provide a default implementation when the user does not
  specify handlers, and application writers can subclass this to
  simplify handler writing.
</dd>

</dl>

<h3> Java-Specific Helper Classes (org.xml.sax.helpers package) </h3>

<p> These classes are not part of the core SAX distribution, and may not
be available in SAX implementations in other languages: they are
provided simply as a convenience for Java programmers.  </p>

<dl>
<dt> ParserFactory</dt>

<dd>
  An application can use the static methods in this class to load SAX
  parsers dynamically at run time, based on the class name.
</dd>

<dt> AttributeListImpl</dt>

<dd>
  An application can use this convenience class to make a persistent
  copy of an AttributeList, or parser can use it to supply a default
  implementation of AttributeList to the application.
</dd>

<dt> LocatorImpl</dt>

<dd>
  An application can use this convenience class to make a persistent
  snapshot of a Locator's values at a specific point in the parse.
</dd>
</dl>
