<h3>SAX2 Parsers in Java</h3>

<p> This is a collection of some of the XML parsers which
support the SAX2 interfaces.
</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/classpathx/jaxp">&AElig;lfred2</a>,
	part of the GNU JAXP project.  Includes a SAX2 pipeline package
	and other SAX2 utilities including a SAX2 DOM parser.
	</li>
    <li><a href="http://xml.apache.org/crimson">Crimson</a>,
	bundled into JDK 1.4 and later to provide JAXP support;
	part of the Apache XML project
	</li>
    <li><a href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces-j">Xerces-J</a>,
	part of the Apache XML project, also supports JAXP
	</li>
    <li><a href="http://technet.oracle.com/tech/xml">Oracle's XML
	Parser for Java v2</a> supports SAX2
	</li>
    <li><a href="http://piccolo.sourceforge.net">Piccolo</a> is unique
	in that it's built using parser generators, rather than using
	a recursive descent parser.  (So it seems likely to sacrifice
	conformance for speed ... it's quite new yet.)
	</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.geocities.com/siaparser">The System Integration
	Automation Parser for XML</a> includes a layer which tracks some
	kinds of parse tree context, to address some kinds of "business
	logic".  (Also quite new.)
	</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.jclark.com/xml/xp/">XP 0.5</a> by James Clark
	is still fast enough and conformant enough to consider using
	if you want a nonvalidating parser.
	It's no longer maintained, and only includes a SAX1 driver,
	but here's a <a href="SAX2Driver.java">SAX2 Driver</a> for it.
	</li>
    <li>... more?
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, since Sun's <a href='http://java.sun.com/xml'>JAXP</a> 1.1 API
incorporates SAX2, any SAX parser bootstapped with JAXP 1.1 supports
both SAX2 and the &#x201c;SAX Extensions 1.0&#x201d; interfaces.
JAXP 1.1 is included with JDK 1.4, but you should manually update it
to use SAX 2.0.1 instead of the older version (which is missing some
bugfixes).
</p>

<p>SAX1 parsers should still be usable with the SAX2 <a href=
"/apidoc/org/xml/sax/helpers/ParserAdapter.html">ParserAdapter</a>
class.  (See the simple driver for XP, above.)
Most of them have been updated to include SAX2 support.
There's also the
<a href="http://www.docuverse.com/htmlsdk/index.html">Docuverse
HTML SDK</a> which provides a SAX1 wrapper around the
HTML parser found in Swing.  (Swing's parser has significant
limitations, but it may meet some of your requirements.)
</p>

<p>If you're interested in SAX parsers that support only subsets
of XML, there are a lot of them.
For example, see
<a href="http://www.wilson.co.uk/xml/minml.htm">MinML</a>
and <a href="http://www.wilson.co.uk/xml/minml2.htm">MinML2</a>.
If the reason you're looking at XML subsets is parser size,
perhaps for embedded environments, look at &AElig;lfred2 
to see about how small a fully conformant SAX2 parser can be.
(That has a non-validating parser at its core, as well as
optional validation and JAXP layers.  It's larger than
MinML2 since it supports all of XML 1.0 and XML Namespaces.)
</p>

<h3>Books and Articles about SAX2 </h3>

<p>There are a lot written about how to use SAX with XML.
This is only a subset of the resources you can find. </p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/sax2">SAX2</a>
	... O'Reilly book on SAX</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2001/12/05/sax2.html">Ten
	SAX2 tips</a> ... for Java programmers </li>
    <li><a href="http://nostarch.com/sax.htm">The Book of SAX</a>
	... a SAX book</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.xml.com/search/index.ncsp?sp-q=SAX">XML.com
	search for "SAX"</a> ... lots of stories, not just Java</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.jdance.com/xmlsax.shtml">SAX News
	and Articles</a> ... jdance.com, seemingly not very current </li>
    <li><em>...more to come ...</em>
</ul>

<h3>Software Using SAX2 </h3>

<p> This is is an incomplete list of interesting software using SAX,
which focusses on infrastructure rather than applications.</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="http://jade.dautelle.com">JADE</a>, the
	<em>Java&#153; Addition to Default Environment</em>,
	supports manipulation of physical quantities and their units,
	and 
	storage of common Java classes in XML representations.
	</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.thaiopensource.com/relaxng/jing.html">Jing</a>
	is a validator for the RelaxNG schema system
	</li>
<!--
    <li><a href="http://newsml-toolkit.sourceforge.net">NewsML Toolkit</a>
	for news industry packaging and metadata
	(SourceForge project).
	</li>
-->
    <li><a href="http://xmlconf.sourceforge.net/?selected=sax">SAX/XML
	conformance testing</a> support at the SourceForge xmlconf project.
	</li>
    <li><a href="http://saxon.sourceforge.net">SAXON</a>
	is a popular XSLT engine built over SAX2
	</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.geocities.com/takuki_kamiya/pub/saxnavi.html"
	>SAX Navigator</a> manages a thread that does the SAX reading
	for your application, so your code can "pull" XML data instead
	of having it "pushed".
	</li>
    <li><a href="http://iso-relax.sourceforge.net/">ISO
	RELAX</a> software (another SourceForge project!) provides a
	standard API for the original RELAX schema system.
	Schema validators can be XML filters.
	</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.sun.com/software/xml/developers/multischema/"
	>Sun's Multi-Schema Validator</a> uses RELAX API with several
	different schema systems, including TREX, RELAX-NG, and W3C Schemas.
	</li>
    <li><a href="http://xml.apache.org/cocoon2/">Cocoon v2</a> is
	an Apache project for a web publishing framework.  The
	basic paradigm is that a kind of SAX2 pipeline should be
	used to connect content generation and management components.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, SAX1 applications still work with SAX2,
although they won't be able to leverage XML Namespaces
very easily, or work at all with information exposed
through the extension interfaces.
</p>

<h3>XML-DEV</h3>

<p> SAX started out on the XML-DEV mailing list.
That list is currently hosted at
<a href='http://www.xml.org'>http://www.xml.org</a>;
you can subscribe at
<a href='http://lists.xml.org/ob/adm.pl'>http://lists.xml.org/ob/adm.pl</a>
and view archives at 
<a href='http://lists.xml.org/archives/xml-dev'
>http://lists.xml.org/archives/xml-dev</a>
(and there's also the old archive at Imperial College,
URL TBS).
</p>

<p> Current XML development uses the lists at SourceForge
(see the Project Page link at the left), but issues raised
on xml-dev will likely get appropriate attention also.
