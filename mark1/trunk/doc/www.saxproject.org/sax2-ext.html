    <h2>SAX 2.0 Extensions</h2><div><p>The SAX2 core includes the <em>org.xml.sax</em> and
<em>org.xml.sax.helpers</em> packages, but that's not all there is to SAX.
The <a href="/apidoc/org/xml/sax/ext/package-summary.html">
org.xml.sax.ext</a>  package includes standardized
extensions, and anyone can define and implement nonstandard ones
using the SAX2 core "feature flags" and "property objects" mechanisms.
</p>

<h3>SAX2 Extensions 1.0</h3>

<p>Part of the original motivation to create SAX2 was to let it
support better "round tripping" of XML data, so that parser outputs
would more closely match the inputs.
Another was to let it expose more of the useful DTD information.
Because not every parser would want to support those two tasks,
they were supported in optional handlers that are part of
a new <em>SAX2 Extensions</em> package.
These needs were met using handlers that are bound using the
SAX2 <code>XMLReader.setProperty()</code> method, and they can
be accessed using <code>XMLReader.getProperty()</code>.
</p>

<p>The <a href="/apidoc/org/xml/sax/ext/DeclHandler.html" >DeclHandler</a>
and <a href="/apidoc/org/xml/sax/ext/LexicalHandler.html">LexicalHandler</a>
interface, and the whole <em>org.xml.sax.ext</em> package, were part of
SAX2 development up through the beta2 release.
After that time they were put into a separate distribution;
core-only SAX2 distributions do not need to include those interfaces.
Final versions of those interface were delivered many months after the
original SAX2 interfaces were defined.
</p>

<p>The SAX2r2 release re-bundles those two interfaces.  They're
still optional in the sense that SAX2 distributions don't need to
include them.
In practice, all distributions are already including them, and
any distribution conforming to the JAXP 1.1 interface specification
needs to include them.
</p>

<h3>SAX2 Extensions 1.1 (beta1)</h3>

<p>Since the original release of SAX2, and 1.0 extensions,
many folk have gained experience with SAX2.
Naturally, some of these have led to requests for new
standardized SAX features.
Notably, not all of the XML Infoset information was available,
so that applications which needed it couldn't be written on
top of the raw SAX API.
Rather than changing the SAX2 core, these new features are
part of the optional extensions package.
</p>

<p>Functionality defined in the <em>SAX2 Extensions 1.1beta1</em>
release includes several new classes and interfaces: </p>  <ul>

<li> The <a href="/apidoc/org/xml/sax/ext/Attributes2.html">Attributes2</a>
    interface, and its
    <a href="/apidoc/org/xml/sax/ext/Attributes2Impl.html">Attributes2Impl</a>
    implementation class.  This exposes which attributes were specified
    in the source text, rather than defaulted through the DTD.
    This is important when implementing DOM as a clean layer over SAX.
    </li>

<li> <a href="/apidoc/org/xml/sax/ext/DefaultHandler2.html">DefaultHandler2</a>
    is a new class which extends <em>org.xml.sax.helpers.DefaultHandler</em>
    to provide stubs for all the <em>DeclHandler</em>, <em>LexicalHandler</em>,
    and <em>EntityResolver2</em> methods.  Most folk using these new handlers
    need such a class.  Defining it here prevents some duplication of effort.
    </li>

<li> <a href="/apidoc/org/xml/sax/ext/EntityResolver2.html">EntityResolver2</a>
    is a new interface supporting two new functionalities, with a clean
    transition mode in the API.
    <em>First</em>, it lets you provide external DTD subsets for documents that
    don't have one.  That lets you validate, or at least perform
    attribute defaulting and normalization, for documents that would
    otherwise "only" be well-formed XML.
    <em>Second</em>, it provides a <em>resolveEntity()</em> method with
    more parameters, which lets you cope with situations where the base
    URI of the document and the entity declaration have become mismatched.
    </li>

<li> The <a href="/apidoc/org/xml/sax/ext/Locator2.html">Locator2</a>
    interface, and its
    <a href="/apidoc/org/xml/sax/ext/Locator2Impl.html">Locator2Impl</a>
    implementation class.  This exposes entity information found in
    the XML and text declarations, packaging it with the other entity
    information which parsers may expose.
    </li>

</ul>

<p> There are also several new feature flags.  These are documented with all
the others, in the main SAX
<a href="/apidoc/org/xml/sax/package-summary.html">package summary</a>.
The feature flags have the usual URI prefix. To summarize them:
</p><ul>

<li><em>is-standalone</em> ... exposes whether the document is
    declared to be standalone</li>

<li><em>resolve-dtd-uris</em> ... if explicitly set to false, then
    system IDs in <code>DTDHandler</code> and <code>DeclHandler</code>
    won't be resolved against the declaration's base URI.
    This supports working with new URI schemes, and certain error-prone
    document management practices.
    </li>

<li><em>use-attributes2</em> ... exposes whether the <code>Attributes</code>
    object passed in <em>ContentHandler.startElement()</em> supports
    the new <code>Attributes2</code> interface (see above).</li>

<li><em>use-locator2</em> ... exposes whether the <code>Locator</code>
    object passed in <em>ContentHandler.setDocumentLocator()</em> supports
    the new <code>Locator2</code> interface (see above).</li>

<li><em>use-entity-resolver2</em> ... says whether to use
    <code>EntityResolver2</code> methods, if the object passed to
    <em>XMLReader.setEntityResolver()</em> supports them
    and the parser is processing that class of external entity.
    </li>

</ul>

<p>At this writing, only the &AElig;lfred2 parser supports many of
these extensions.  Conformance tests for them are yet to be developed.
