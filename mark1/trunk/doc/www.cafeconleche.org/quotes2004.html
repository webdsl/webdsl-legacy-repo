In Java, XML can be your savior because it lets you implement domain-specific languages and increase the flexibility of your application "without coding". In Java, avoiding coding is an advantage because coding means recompiling. But in Python, more often than not, code is easier to write than XML.

At all. Ever. Not even just this once. Don't even think about it. Drop that schema and put your hands in the air, now!

Don't getme wrong on this - Flash is a very powerful tool for creatingimpressive looking graphic animations. The difference between Flash andSVG, however, is that Flash is a self-contained world; SVG on the otherhand is beginning to shape up into an application that entwines itselfwithin other specifications.</p><p>This will become more obvious whenSVG moves more into the native space of browsers and operating systems,rather than being a plug-in. The significance of the Mozilla SVGeffort, even at its current nascent stage, is that you can createinteractive and animated graphics inline to other markup such as XHTMLor XUL.

I saw this as a very simple idea. Send me a message of type A and I'll agree to send back messages of types B, C, or D depending on your A. If the message is a simple query, send it as a URL with a query string. In the services world, this has become XML over HTTP much more than so called "web services" with their huge and complex panoply of SOAP specs and standards. Why? Because it is easy and quick. Virtually anyone can build such requests. Heck, you can test them using a browser. That's really the big thing. Anyone can play. You don't have to worry about any of the complexity of WSDL or WS-TX or WS-CO. Since most users of SOAP today don't actually use SOAP standards for reliability (too fragmented) or asynchrony (even more so) or even security (too complex), what are they getting from all this complex overhead. Well, for one, it is a lot slower. The machinery for cracking a query string in a URL is about as fast as one can imagine these days due to the need services have to be quick. The machinery for processing a SOAP request is probably over ten times as slow (that's a guess). Formatting the response, of course, doesn't actually require custom XML machinery. If you can return HTML, you can return XML. It is this sort of thinking that being at a service company engenders. How do you keep it really simple, really lightweight, and really fast. Sure, you can still support the more complex things, but the really useful things may turn out to be simplest ones.</blockquote><p>--Adam Bosworth <br />Read the rest in <a href="http://www.adambosworth.net/archives/000024.html">Adam Bosworth's Weblog: KISS and The Mom Factor </a></p></dd><dt id="quote2004November11">Thursday, November 11, 2004</dt><dd><blockquote cite="http://news.com.com/Firefox+1.0+fans+clog+Mozilla+site/2100-1032_3-5445185.html?tag=nl">Firefox is suffering from a success crisis.The bad news is so many people can't get to the site.

It had a number of benefits.</p><p>Firstly, it simplified things greatly. With REST there was no need for complicated SOAP libraries on either the client or server, just use a plain HTTP call. This reduced coupling and brittleness. We had previously lost hours (possibly days) tracing problems through libraries that were outside of our control.</p><p>Secondly, it improved scalability. Though this was not the reason we moved, it was a nice side-effect. The web-server, client HTTP library and any HTTP proxy in-between understood things like the difference between GET and POST and when a resource has not been modified so they can offer effective caching - greatly reducing the amount of traffic. This is why REST is a more scalable solution than XML-RPC or SOAP over HTTP.</p><p>Thirdly, it reduced the payload over the wire. No need for SOAP envelope wrappers and it gave us the flexibility to use formats other than XML for the actual resource data. For instance a resource containing the body of an unformatted news headline is simpler to express as plain text and a table of numbers is more concise (and readable) as CSV.</p></blockquote><p>--Joe Walnes <br />Read the rest in <a href="http://joe.truemesh.com/blog//000391.html">Joe Walnes, REST and FishEye </a></p></dd><dt id="quote2004October1">Friday, October 1, 2004</dt><dd>	<blockquote cite="http://weblogs.java.net/pub/wlg/1760">When developers argue on a list about the best way to do something it's the first person to code it who wins.

You can read a good               account of the latest round in that debate in the September 26th               Boston Globe, where Tom Rosenthiel reports on the Democratic Convention’s               efforts to decide “which scribes, bloggers, on-air correspondents               and on-air correspondents and off-air producers and camera crews”               would have press credentials and access to the action. Bloggers               were awarded credentials for the first time, and, I, for one, was               glad to see it. I’ve just finished reading Dan Gillmor’s               new book, <i>We the Media</i>, and recommend it heartily to you.               Gilmore is a national columnist for the San Jose Mercury News and               writes a daily weblog for SiliconValley.com. He argues persuasively               that Big Media is losing its monopoly on the news, thanks to the               Internet – that “citizen journalists” of all stripes,               in their independent, unfiltered reports, are transforming the news               from a lecture to a conversation. He’s on to something. In               one sense we are discovering all over again the feisty spirit of               our earliest days as a nation when the republic and a free press               were growing up together. It took no great amount of capital and               credit – just a few hundred dollars – to start a paper               then. There were well over a thousand of them by 1840. They were               passionate and pugnacious and often deeply prejudiced; some spoke               for Indian-haters, immigrant-bashers, bigots, jingoes, and land-grabbers.               But some called to the better angels of our nature -- Tom Paine,               for one, the penniless immigrant from England, who, in 1776 –just               before joining Washington’s army – published the hard-hitting               pamphlet, <i>Common Sense</i>, with its uncompromising case for               American independence. It became our first best seller because Paine               was possessed of an unwavering determination to reach ordinary people               – to “make those that can scarcely read understand”               and “to put into language as plain as the alphabet” the               idea that they mattered and could stand up for their rights.</p>                            <p>              So the Internet may indeed engage us in a new conversation of democracy.               Even as it does, you and I will in no way be relieved from wrestling               with what it means ethically to be a professional journalist. I               believe Tom Rosenthiel got it right in that Boston Globe article               when he said that the proper question is not whether you call yourself               a journalist but whether your own work constitutes journalism. And               what is that? I like his answer: “A journalist tries to get               the facts right,” tries to get “as close as possible to               the verifiable truth” – not to help one side win or lose               but “to inspire public discussion.” Neutrality, he concludes,               is not a core principle of journalism, “but the commitment               to facts, to public consideration, and to independence from faction,               is.”</p></blockquote><p>--Bill Moyers <br />Read the rest in <a href="http://www.spj.org/convention_moyers.asp">Society of Professional Journalists - SPJ National Convention </a></p></dd><dt id="quote2004September18">Saturday, September 18, 2004</dt><dd><blockquote cite="http://www.vanderburg.org/Blog/Software/Applications/firefox_rising.blog"><p>93.7% still seems like a really daunting market share for IE.

For example take so called web services. The original impetus behind XML, at least as far as I was concerned back in 1996, was a way to exchange data between programs so that a program could become a service for another program. I saw this as a very simple idea. Send me a message of type A and I'll agree to send back messages of types B, C, or D depending on your A. If the message is a simple query, send it as a URL with a query string. In the services world, this has become XML over HTTP much more than so called "web services" with their huge and complex panoply of SOAP specs and standards. Why? Because it is easy and quick. Virtually anyone can build such requests. Heck, you can test them using a browser. That's really the big thing. Anyone can play. You don't have to worry about any of the complexity of WSDL or WS-TX or WS-CO. Since most users of SOAP today don't actually use SOAP standards for reliability (too fragmented) or asynchrony (even more so) or even security (too complex), what are they getting from all this complex overhead. Well, for one, it is a lot slower. The machinery for cracking a query string in a URL is about as fast as one can imagine these days due to the need services have to be quick.

The more you build alternative abstractions on top of that and look at XML instead as a serialization of some other abstraction such as an object or a remote procedure call the more you build in assumptions about how components will process XML and the less rationale there is for using XML. </p>	</blockquote><p>	--James Clark<br />Read the rest in <cite>RELAX NG</cite>,  O'Reilly &amp; Associates, 2003, pp. ix</p></dd><dt id="quote2004April11">Sunday, April 11, 2004</dt><dd>	<blockquote cite="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/7/36777.html">Let's keep things in perspective.

When Microsoft rolled out .Net, they didn’t include a SAX parser for .Net, but something just a fast (and just as complicated to code against) called the XmlReader (which is basically the pull version equivalent of the push style SAX parser), and .Net developers still had basically two ways to parse XML, and most developers still used the DOM.  If you want to parse some XML, you used the DOM.  If you had to worry about memory or performance, you used one of the XmlReaders.
