The Free Software Foundation is <a
href="http://www.fsf.org/philosophy/w3c-patent.html">calling</a> for the
W3C to make their <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-patent-policy-20021114">patent
policy</a> GPL compatible, which it apparently still is not because it
allows patent holders to limit their royalty-free licenses to spec
implementations only. <a
href="mailto:www-patentpolicy-comment@w3.org">Comments</a> to the W3C
are due by midnight today, but in practice the W3C often listens to good
comments past the official date, so don't hesitate to contribute just
because you're not reading this unil the New Year.

Roger L. Costello and David B. Jacobs have begun work on the
collaborative development of a <a

distributed, decentralized Web service registry</a>. He seems to be
thoroughly annoying the ebXML community that wants to have a centralized
monopoly on web services registries. "The purpose of this effort is to
develop a concrete, implementable architecture for a highly distributed
registry. The notion is that each Web service defines their own registry
- comprised of the collection of documents that describes the service."

The W3C XML Linking Working Group has posted a new <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-xptr-xpointer-20021219/">working
draft of the XPointer xpointer() Scheme</a>. This draft cleans up the
specification a lot, but does not appear to make any significant changes
to the language syntax or semantics.
</p>

<p>
The working group's charter expires at the end of the year, and there
seems to be little will in the W3C for continuing with this. Since
XPointer hasn't even gotten to last call working draft yet, it seems
unlikely that this will ever be finished. This may be a good thing. The
full syntax just seems too ugly and verbose to achieve widespread
adoption. Even within the W3C, there's signifcant <a
href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-xml-linking-comments/
2002OctDec/0039.html">dissent</a>. Outside the W3C, reactions to
XPointer range from open hostility to apathy, but nobody seems to
actually like it.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
The W3C XHTML working group has published a <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-xhtml2-20021211">new working draft of
XHTML 2.0</a>, just one week after the last working draft. According to
the abstract, "It was released very soon after the second public Working
Draft because of production errors, and does not reflect any major
changes from that draft." XHTML 2.0 is the next, backwards incompatible
version of HTML that incorporates XFrames, XForms, and lots of other
crunchy XML goodness. However, XLink is not yet included and may never
be. (The HTML Working Group are extreme XLink skeptics.)
</p>
<hr />
<p>
The  W3C Math Working Group has published the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-MathML2-20021219/">first working
draft of the second edition of the MathML 2.0 specification</a>. Like
the second edition of XML 1.0, this focuses on incorporating errata and
cleaning up the language of the spec, rather than on introducing new
features or changing existing ones. Among other improvements, this draft
now includes a <a
href="http://www.w3.org/Math/XMLSchema/mathml2/mathml2.xsd">schema for
MathML 2.0</a> as well as a DTD. The MathML 2.0 described here should be
completely identical to the one described by the first edition.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
The  W3C Quality Assurance (QA) Activity has posted the first public
working draft of the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-qaframe-test-20021220/">QA Framework:
Test Guidelines</a>. "This document defines a set of common guidelines
for conformance test materials for W3C specifications."
</p>
<hr />
<p>
The W3C
Web Services Internationalization Task Force has published the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-ws-i18n-scenarios-20021220/">first
public working draft of Web Services Internationalization Usage
Scenarios</a>. This describes various issues that arise when using SOAP
services in multi-language environments. For example, is it possible to
send error messages in both English and  Japanese?
</p>
<hr />
<p>
And speaking of Japanese, the Center for Global Communications,
International University of Japan (GLOCOM), Infoteria Corporation, and
Media Fusion Co., Ltd have submitted a note to the W3C describing
ongoing work within Japan on <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/NOTE-EGIX-20021220/">Embedding Glyph
Identifiers in XML Documents</a>. This describes a means to specify
exactly which glyph should be used for a single Unicode character,
something which is apparently a lot more significant in ideographic
languages than alphabetic ones. Glyph selection would use a special
<code>glyph:name</code> attribute that references a glyph by its
position in the <cite>SO/IEC 10036:1996, Information Technology -- Font
information interchange -- Procedures for registration of font-related
identifiers</cite> standard. This note  will not be put on the W3C
standards track. Instead, it's being moved through the  Japanese
Standards Association (JSA).

<p>
The W3C XML Protocol Working Group has released the candidate 
recommendations of the three SOAP 1.2 specifications:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/CR-soap12-part0-20021219">SOAP Version 1.2 Part 0: Primer</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/CR-soap12-part1-20021219">SOAP Version 1.2 Part 1: Messaging Framework</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-soap12-part2-20020626">SOAP Version 1.2 Part 2: Adjuncts</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
The namespace URIs are now  http://www.w3.org/2002/12/soap-envelope and
http://www.w3.org/2002/12/soap-encoding. Otherwise, it's not obvious to
me what the changes are in this draft. Since, I think there are multiple
fairly deep and fundamental flaws in SOAP, and they don't seem likely to
be fixed, I haven't been following this work too closely. Comments are
due by January 24.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
Robert C. Lyons has released the
<a href="http://www.unidex.com/turing/"> Turing Machine Markup Language (TMML)</a>. 
This is an  XML application for describing Turing machines.
He also rote a TMML interpreter in XSLT
that  executes 
the Turing machine  described in the TMML source 
document.
This is another proof by construction that XSLT 1.0 is Turing-complete.

<hr />
<p>
John Cowan's posted <a
href="http://www.ccil.org/~cowan/XML/tagsoup">TagSoup 0.8</a>, a "parser
written in Java that, instead of parsing well-formed or valid XML,
parses HTML as it is found in the wild: nasty and brutish, though quite
often far from short. TagSoup is designed for people who have to process
this stuff using some semblance of a rational application design. By
providing a SAX interface, it allows standard XML tools to be applied to
even the worst HTML."

<p>
The W3C XML Core Working Group has posted the candidate recommendation
of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-names11/">Namespaces in XML
1.1</a>. Their don't appear to be any functional changes since the last
call working draft. Changes since 1.0 are:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>IRI references are used instead of URI references</li>
	<li>Namespace prefixes can be undeclared</li>
	<li>The prefix <code>xmlns</code> is by definition bound to the
	namespace name <code>http://www.w3.org/2000/xmlns/</code>. </li>
</ul>


<hr />
<p>
Mark Hale's released version 0.881 of <a
href="http://jsci.org.uk/">JSci</a>, a Java class library containing
many useful mathematical and scientific functions such as complex
arithmetic. The major new feature in this release is that all the
periodic table classes have been replaced by XML documents (packaged in
the jar file). "Element objects can be instantiated using the new
factory method PeriodicTable.getElement(). This makes the data easier to
update and more accessible for processing. As a consequence, a periodic
table reference in HTML is now included with the documentation -
generated by applying an xsl stylesheet to the xml files."
</p>
<hr />
<p>
The Mozilla Project has posted the first alpha of <a
href="http://www.mozilla.org/releases/">Mozilla 1.3</a>. This release
focuses on mail. Message Views is a new feature "which will help users
locate, organize and prioritize their mail messages. A View is used to
filter and display only those messages matching a given set of criteria.
Mozilla ships with a set of pre-defined Views, but users can also create
their own."
</p>

<p>
Mail filter actions have also been  improved, as has compatibility with
some mail servers. The biggvest new feature is junk mail classification
so  you can train your client to distinguish between good mail and junk
mail. I've recently installed <a
href="http://www.spamassassin.org/">SpamAssassin</a> for this purpose
and it seems to be catching about 60% of the spam I receive, including
almost all of the most egregious examples. So far I haven't seen any
false positives, and I'm going to try turning down the number of hits
required to identify e-mail as spam.
</p>

<p>
Finally, Mac OS 9 support has been removed from this release. Third
parties may release their own OS 9 builds.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
IBM's alphaWorks has released version 3.3.1 of their <a
href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/webservicestoolkit">Web
Services Toolkit</a>. The "basic software components needed to create a
Web services environment are provided with Web Services Tool Kit.
Included is an architectural blueprint (Web Services Architecture),
sample programs, Utility services, and some tools that are helpful in
developing and deploying Web services. Extensive documentation is
included to assist developers with the basic concepts of Web services.
The tool kit also includes a fully-functioning Web services client API
that can be used to directly access a UDDI registry." New features in
3.3.1  adds WS-Policy and  WSRP. Java 1.3 or later is required.

 The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) User Agent Accessibility Guidelines
 Working Group (UAWG) has released the final recommendation of <a
 href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/REC-UAAG10-20021217/">User Agent
 Accessibility Guidelines 1.0</a>. The abstract states, "This document
 provides guidelines for designing user agents that lower barriers to
 Web accessibility for people with disabilities (visual, hearing,
 physical, cognitive, and neurological). User agents include HTML
 browsers and other types of software that retrieve and render Web
 content. A user agent that conforms to these guidelines will promote
 accessibility through its own user interface and through other internal
 facilities, including its ability to communicate with other
 technologies (especially assistive technologies). Furthermore, all
 users, not just users with disabilities, should find conforming user
 agents to be more usable."
</p>

<p>
The UAWG has also puublished a complementary note covering <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/NOTE-UAAG10-TECHS-20021217/">Techniques
for User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0</a>. "These techniques
address key aspects of the accessibility of user interfaces, content

as the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
and the Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL)."

 "Delivery context information is typically used to provide an
 appropriate format, styling or other aspect of some web content that
 will make it suitable for the capabilities of a presentation device.
 The selection or adaptation required to achieve this may be performed
 by an origin server, by an intermediary in the delivery path, or by a

has released <a href="http://www.brics.dk/DSD/dsd2.html">Document Structure Description 2.0 (DSD2)</a>,
yet another  schema language for XML. 
This one is based on boolean logic and regular exxpressions, and does

I'm continuing to experiment with XHTML 1.1 for this page. In
particular, I'm using the internal DTD subset to extend and replace some
of the normal content models and attribute lists. You can check out your
browser's support for that <a
href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/index.xhtml">here</a>. So far, here's
my score card:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mozilla 1.2.1 Mac: A+, no problems at all</li>
  <li>Mozilla 1.1, Windows 2000: A+, no problems at all</li>
  <li>Mozilla 1.0.1 Linux: A+, no problems at all</li>

  Downloads it to disk instead. (Note: This is the most current version of the most common browser for the Macintosh.)
Also fails to render the CSS background colors properly.</li>
  <li>Internet Explorer 6.0 SP 1 Windows 2000: F, completely unable to display it.
  Downloads it to disk instead. (Note: This is the most current version of the most common browser for Windows.)
Also fails to render the CSS background colors properly.</li>
    <li>Internet Explorer 5.1.3 Mac: F, completely unable to display it.

  </li>
      <li>Konqueror 3.0.3, Linux: F, completely unable to display it.
  Downloads it to disk instead. 
  </li>

</ul>

<p>
The big question mark seems to be the MIME type I serve the page with.
If I serve it with text/html everything pretty much works, except that all the browsers display the "]>" at the end of the internal DTD subset. If I serve
it as application/xhtml+xml, then Mozilla derived browsers and Opera 6 and later 
work perfectly, but everything else works not at all. 
Given this, I really can't see using XHTML for web sites for several years at least. 
</p>

<p>
What I'm doing turns out not to be strictly conforming XHTML
(redefining parameter entity references in the internal DTD subset
and adding new elements in the XHTML namespace are big no-no's) but the 
browsers that support XHTML don't seem to have any trouble with this. 
It is possible to create valid documents based on XHTML without
going through the hassle of creating a new profile using the
modularization framework.
I'm not sure there's any point to doing this, though.

Evaluation and Report Language (EARL) 1.0</a>.
EARL is:

<blockquote>
<p> a language to express test results. Test results include bug
reports, test suite evaluations, and conformance claims. The test
subject might be a Web site, an authoring tool, a user agent or some
other entity. Thus, EARL is flexible. It enables any person, entity, or
organization to state test results for any thing tested against any set
of criteria. </p>

<p>Stating test results in EARL creates a variety of opportunities. The
data can be--</p>

<ul>
	<li>exchanged between tools;</li>
	<li>used to create reports;</li>
	<li>combined to compare how different test subjects fared on the same test.</li>
</ul>

	<li> New ZipArchiveSerializer to build zip files aggregating various sources as archive entries. </li>
	<li>CocoonServlet upload behavior now configurable from the web.xml.</li>


	<li> XScript now has better variable management: variables of
	request, session, global, and page scope are stored not in the
	XScriptManager, but as request, session, context attributes, or as
	XSP page field (respectively).    </li>

<blockquote>
<b>HaXml</b> is a collection of utilities for using
<a href="http://www.haskell.org">Haskell</a> and
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml">XML</a>
together.  Its basic facilities include:

<ul>
<li> a parser for XML,</li>
<li> a separate error-correcting parser for HTML,</li>
<li> an XML validator,</li>
<li> pretty-printers for XML and HTML.</li>
</ul>

<p>
For processing XML documents, the following components are provided:
</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Combinators</em> is a combinator library for generic XML document
    processing, including transformation, editing, and generation.</li>
<li><em>Haskell2Xml</em> is a replacement class for Haskell's Show/Read
    classes: it allows you to read and write ordinary Haskell data as XML
    documents.  The <em>DrIFT</em> tool (available from
    <a href="http://repetae.net/~john/computer/haskell/DrIFT/">
    <tt>http://repetae.net/~john/computer/haskell/DrIFT/</tt></a>)
    can automatically derive this class for you.</li>
<li><em>DtdToHaskell</em> is a tool for translating any valid XML DTD
    into equivalent Haskell types.</li>

<li>In conjunction with the <em>Xml2Haskell</em> class framework,
    this allows you to generate, edit, and transform documents as normal
    typed values in programs, and to read and write them as human-readable
    XML documents.</li>
<li>Finally, <em>Xtract</em> is a <em>grep</em>-like tool for XML documents,
    loosely based on the XPath and XQL query languages.  It can be used
    either from the command-line, or within your own code as part of the
    library.</li>

		visualization (image highlights with system selection
		color when selected) and the removal of the confusing
		toolbar grippies.</p></li>

specifications on quality assurance:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-qaframe-intro-20021108/">QA Framework: Introduction</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-qaframe-ops-20021108/">QA Framework: Operational Guidelines</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-qaframe-spec-20021108/">QA Framework: Specification Guidelines</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
These describe "a common framework for enhancing the quality practices
of the W3C Working Groups in the areas of specification editing,
production of test materials, and coordination efforts with internal and
external groups."

<p>
The W3C Device Independence Working Group has published a
second  last call
working draft of
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-CCPP-struct-vocab-20021108/">Composite Capability/Preference
Profiles (CC/PP): Structure and Vocabularies</a>.
This is an RDF vocabulary for describing
user agent (browser) and proxy capabilities and preferences. Topics
include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The structure of client capability and preference descriptions </li>
    <li>The structure of proxy behavior description</li>
    <li>  The use of RDF classes to distinguish different elements of a profile,
    so that a schema-aware RDF processor can handle CC/PP profiles embedded in other XML document types. </li>
</ul>

<p> The CC/PP vocabulary uses URIs to refer to specific
capabilities and preferences. It covers: </p>

<ul>
    <li>The types of values to which CC/PP attributes may refer</li>
    <li>How to introduce new vocabularies </li>
    <li>A client vocabulary covering print and display capabilities </li>
    <li>A survey of existing work from which new vocabularies may be derived. </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>
The W3C Cascading Style Sheets working group has published working drafts 
of  two new modules for CSS Level 3:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-css3-border-20021107">CSS3 module: Border</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-css3-lists-20021107">CSS3 module: Lists</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
New properties for borders since CSS2 include
<code>border-image</code>,
<code>border-fit</code>,
<code>border-image-transform</code>,
<code>border-break</code>, and 
<code>box-shadow</code>.

	
</p>

<p>
Changes in lists since CSS2 include:
</p>


<ul>
	<li><code>display:marker</code> has been replaced by 
	the <code>::marker</code> pseudo-element</li>
	<li>It is no longer possible to make end markers. </li>
	<li>The <code>marker-offset</code> property is obsolete. </li>
	<li>The marker display type is obsoleted. </li>
	<li>Markers are now aligned relative to the line box edge, rather than the border edge. </li>
	<li>Markers now have margins. </li>
	<li>Many new list style types as well as explicit algorithms for all list style types. </li>
	<li>Error handling rules for unknown list style types were changed to
	 be consistent with the normal parsing error handling rules. </li>
	<li>A  list-item predefined counter identifier </li>
</ul>

IBM's alphaWorks has released
<a href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/xmlprocessingplusplus">XML Processing Plus Plus</a>
a new "typed and stream-based XML processing language" that
 extends Java  with 
 new XML stream APIs: <code>XmlIn</code> and <code>XmlOut</code>. <code>XmlIn</code> 
 retrieves data from XML input streams, and <code>XmlOut</code> is 
 inserts data into XML output streams.
"XML Processing Plus Plus includes the xpppc compiler, which converts
programs written in XML Processing Plus Plus syntax into standard Java
byte code. The compiler supports type checking based on DTDs (document
type definitions). The type checker reports semantic errors of XML
manipulation against DTDs".

IBM has also updated their <a
href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/xml4j">XML Parser for Java</a>
to version 4.1.2. This release is based on Xerces-J 2.2.0 and supports
the W3C XML Schema Recommendation 1.0, SAX 1.0 and 2.0, DOM Level 1, DOM
Level 2, and some experimental features of DOM Level 3 Core and
Load/Save Working Drafts, JAXP 1.2, and XNI.

I've extracted out all the <a
href="books/xmljava/examples/index.html">examples from Processing XML
with Java</a> into individual files. You can download them as a <a
href="books/xmljava/xmljava_examples.zip">zip archive</a> if you like. I
actually wrote an XSLT stylesheet to pull all the examples out of the
chapters, dump them into individual files, and then generate the index
files from the titles used in the book. I used ant to automatically
apply the stylesheet and zip all the examples, so this is just a single
part of the book's build process. (Question: it seems that Ant is
missing one key feature that make has, the ability to detect whether a
file on the disk has changed since the last build, and thus whether
dependent files needs to be regenerated or not. Ant seems to rebuild the
entire project from scratch every time. Is there any way to avoid this?)
</p>

<p>
Several of the examples communicate with web services
running on 
http://www.elharo.com. Unfortunately, between the time the book went to press and now,
an upgrade to that server necessitated by security concerns
broke a number of URLs published in the book. The services are still running,
just not at quite the same URLs.
I think in all cases you can access them by
chnaging /fibonacci to /fibonacci/servlet. 
For instance, Example 3-10 and most of the examples in Chapter 5
 attempt to communicate with
a servlet running at http://www.elharo.com/fibonacci/XML-RPC.
Instead you can connect to http://www.elharo.com/fibonacci/servlet/XML-RPC.
In Example 3-11, you would change http://www.elharo.com/fibonacci/SOAP
to http://www.elharo.com/fibonacci/servlet/SOAP and so forth.
</p>

<p>
I do not know why the new version of the Java Development Kit for the Cobalt Qube
will not let me map the servlets to the shorter URLs. I just know that it won't.
If anyone has a supposition as to how I might fix this so that 
the shorter URLs work again, please let me know.
I've been tearing my hair out trying to fix this.
This is using a special version of Tomcat 3.2.1 for Sun's 
Cobalt Qube. As near as I can tell it just doesn't pay any attention to
the servlet mappings defined in the <a
href="http://www.elharo.com/fibonacci/WEB-INF/web.xml">web.xml</a> file
like the old version did.

The W3C Web Ontology 
Working Group has published three updated working drafts about the
Web Ontology Language (OWL):
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-owl-guide-20021104/">Web Ontology Language (OWL) Guide Version 1.0</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-owl-ref-20021112/">Web Ontology Language (OWL) Reference Version 1.0</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-owl-semantics-20021108/">Web Ontology Language (OWL) Abstract Syntax and Semantics</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
According to the Guide abstract,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p> The World Wide Web as it is currently constituted resembles a poorly
mapped geography. Our insight into the documents and capabilities
available are based on keyword searches, abetted by clever use of
document connectivity and usage patterns. The sheer mass of this data is
unmanageable without powerful tool support. In order to map this terrain
more precisely, computational agents require machine-readable
descriptions of the content and capabilities of web accessible
resources. These descriptions must be in addition to the human-readable
versions of that information. </p>

<p> The Web Ontology Language (OWL) is intended to provide a language
that can be used to describe the classes and relations between them that
are inherent in Web documents and applications. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The reference abstract further elucidates:
</p>

<blockquote>
	OWL is a semantic markup language for publishing and sharing
	ontologies on the World Wide Web. OWL is derived from the DAML+OIL
	Web Ontology Language [DAML+OIL] and builds upon the Resource
	Description Framework [RDF/XML Syntax].

I've posted updated notes from my final two talks at Software Development 2002
East this past week,
<a href="slides/sd2002east/xmlpull/">XML Pull Parsing</a> and 
and <a href="slides/sd2002east/dom/">DOM</a>.
The XML Pull Parsing Talk was particularly fun. It includes a lot of new material 
on Andy Clark's <a href="http://www.apache.org/~andyc/neko/doc/pull/">NekoPull</a> 
that hasn't gotten a lot of notice yet.
Unlike XMLPULL, NekoPull is fully conformant to the XML specification in both 
interface and implementation. The API is also much more sensible than XMLPULL.
It doesn't make all the compromises XMLPULL makes for J2ME environments 
in the name of size and speed.
</p>

<p>
	However, the NekoPull API is  far from perfect. There are definitely
	some weird spots. The two most obvious are short type constants and
	the use of public fields instead of getter and setter methods. There
	are also several dependencies on the Xerces Native Interface (XNI)
	that prevent it from being a truly generic API for other parsers. In
	the long term, I have high hopes for <a
	href="http://www.jcp.org/jsr/detail/173.jsp">StAX, the Streaming API
	for XML</a>, being developed in the Java Community Process, mostly
	becomes James Clark is on the expert group. I'll be revisting and
	updating all of this in just about four months at <a
	href="http://www.sdexpo.com/2003/west/">Software Development West

	watching right now.

<p>
Jonathan Borden has posted a draft of <a href="http://www.rddl.org/RDDL2.html">RDDL 2.0</a>. 
RDDL is an XHTML-based vocabulary for human readable 
and machine processable documents placed at the end of namespace URLs.
The major change in version 2.0 is the option to use RDF instead of XLinks. 
For example, in the old XLink style, a <code>rddl:resource</code> element might look like this:
</p>

<pre><code>&lt;rddl:resource xlink:href="baseball.dtd"
  xlink:role="http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/media-types/application/xml-dtd"
    xlink:arcrole="http://www.rddl.org/purposes#validation"&gt;
  &lt;div id="DTD" class="resource"&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;DTD&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="baseball.dtd"&gt;DTD&lt;/a&gt; for baseball statistics&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/rddl:resource&gt;</code></pre>     

<p>
In the new RDF style, it might look like this:
</p>

<pre><code>&lt;rdf:Description rdf:ID="DTD" rddl:title="DTD">
  &lt;purpose:validation>
    &lt;rddl:resource rdf:about="baseball.dtd" >
      &lt;rddl:nature 
        rdf:resource="http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/media-types/application/xml-dtd"
      />
    &lt;/rddl:resource>
    &lt;div id="DTD" class="resource"&gt;
      &lt;h3&gt;DTD&lt;/h3&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="baseball.dtd"&gt;DTD&lt;/a&gt; for baseball statistics&lt;/p&gt;
     &lt;/div&gt;  
   &lt;/purpose:validation>
&lt;/rdf:Description></code></pre>  

<p>
A second, slightly less ugly RDF option looks like this:
</p>

<pre><code>&lt;rddl:resource ID="DTD">
  &lt;rddl:title>DTD&lt;/rddl:title>
  &lt;rddl:nature 
    resource="http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/media-types/application/xml-dtd"/>
  &lt;rddl:purpose 
    resource="http://www.rddl.org/purposes#validation"/>
  &lt;rddl:related resource="baseball.dtd"/>
  &lt;rddl:prose>
    &lt;div id="DTD" class="resource"&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;DTD&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="baseball.dtd"&gt;DTD&lt;/a&gt; for baseball statistics&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/rddl:prose>
&lt;/rddl:resource></code></pre>

	The W3C  RDF Core Working Group  has updated six working drafts
	covering various aspects of the Resource Description Framework.
	According to the <a
	href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-rdf-primer-20021111/">primer
	draft</a>, "The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a language
	for representing information about resources in the World Wide Web.
	It is particularly intended for representing metadata about Web
	resources, such as the title, author, and modification date of a Web
	page, copyright and licensing information about a Web document, or
	the availability schedule for some shared resource. However, by
	generalizing the concept of a 'Web resource', RDF can also be used
	to represent information about things that can be identified on the
	Web, even when they can't be directly retrieved on the Web. RDF
	provides a common framework for expressing this information so it
	can be exchanged between applications without loss of meaning." The
	updated specs, in roughly the order you might want to read them,
	are:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-rdf-primer-20021111/">RDF Primer</a> "is designed to provide the reader with the basic knowledge required to effectively use RDF. It introduces the basic concepts of RDF and describes its XML syntax. It describes how to define RDF vocabularies using the RDF Vocabulary Description Language, and gives an overview of some deployed RDF applications. It also describes the content and purpose of other RDF specification documents."</p></li>
	<li><p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-rdf-mt-20021112/">RDF Semantics</a> "s a specification of a precise semantics for RDF and RDFS, with some entailment results. It is intended to be readable by a general technical audience."</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-rdf-concepts-20021108/">Resource Description Framework (RDF): Concepts and Abstract Syntax</a>
"defines an XML syntax for the Resource Description Framework (RDF) as amended and clarified by the RDF Core Working Group from that originally described in RDF Model &amp; Syntax. The syntax is updated to be specified in terms of XML, XML Namespaces, the XML Information Set with new support for XML Base. The parts of the RDF/XML syntax are explained along with examples of how they work. The formal grammar is annotated with actions for generating the arcs that form the RDF graph as defined in the RDF Concepts and Abstract Syntax Working Draft. This is done using the N-Triples RDF Graph serializing format which enables more precise recording of the mapping in a machine processable form. These tests are gathered and published in the RDF Test Cases Working Draft."</p>
</li>

	<li><p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-rdf-schema-20021112/">RDF Vocabulary Description Language 1.0: RDF Schema</a> 
"describes how to use RDF to describe RDF vocabularies. This specification also defines a basic vocabulary for this purpose, as well as conventions that can be used by Semantic Web applications to support more sophisticated RDF vocabulary description."</p>
</li>
	<li><p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-rdf-testcases-20021112/">RDF Test Cases</a> describes a set of machine-processable test cases for RDF

The W3C XForms Working Group
has posted the candidate recommendation of 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/CR-xforms-20021112/">XForms 1.0</a>.
According to the abstract,
</p>

<blockquote>
XForms is an XML application that represents the next generation of
forms for the Web. By splitting traditional XHTML forms into three
parts-XForms model, instance data, and user interface-it separates
presentation from content, allows reuse, gives strong typing-reducing
the number of round-trips to the server, as well as offering device
independence and a reduced need for scripting.

The W3C Technical Architecture Group (TAG)
has published an updated working draft 
of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-webarch-20021115/">Architecture 
of the World Wide Web.</a>
This is still incomplete, but makes for interesting reading.

class="glossary-entry">agents</a> (<span id="desc-glossary-agents"
class="glossary-desc">programs acting on behalf of another person,
entity, or process</span>) that exchange information.</p>

<p>This document organizes Web architecture into:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Identification</strong>. Agents identify objects in the
system (called "resources") with Uniform Resource Identifiers
(<acronym>URIs</acronym>), defined in [<a
href="#RFC2396">RFC2396</a>].</li>

<li><strong>Representation</strong>. Agents represent resources
using a nonexclusive set of data formats, separately or in
combination (e.g., XHTML, CSS, PNG, XLink, RDF/XML, SMIL
animation). This section also discusses technologies for building
new data formats (XML, XML Namespaces).</li>

<li><strong>Interaction</strong>. Agents exchange representations
via protocols, including HTTP [<a

<cite>XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0 Data Model</cite> assuming you're already familiar with XSLT 1.0. Otherwise, you should begin by learning XSLT 1.0.

As Murphy's Law requires,
they did this just a couple of days before I have to leave for Boston to talk about exactly this at SD Expo. So much for the notes I had prepared. I guess I know what I'm reading on the plane now. From a first glance, here are the major changes in these releases:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-query-datamodel-20021115/">XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0 Data Model</a></dt><dd>
<p>
  This document has been rewritten very heavily. You should probably just read it. It's much cleaner and more consistent. The key paragraph is the following:
</p>

<blockquote>
Every value handled by the data model is a sequence of zero or more items. An item is either a node or an atomic value. A node is defined in 4 Nodes and is one of seven node kinds. An atomic value encapsulates an XML Schema atomic type and a corresponding value of that type. They are defined in 5 Atomic Values. A sequence is an ordered collection of nodes, atomic values, or any mixture of nodes and atomic values. A sequence cannot be a member of a sequence. A single item appearing on its own is modeled as a sequence containing one item. Sequences are defined in 6 Sequences.
</blockquote>

<p>
	However, data models are tricky things, and I really need to read
	this more carefully. At first glance, it does appear to require some
	basic notion of well-formedness, unlike the infoset. For instance,
	it does require that each attribute of an element have a unique
	name, which the Infoset does not.
</p>

</dd>


<dt><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-xpath20-20021115">XML Path Language (XPath) 2.0</a></dt><dd>

<ul>
		<li>Rules for matching values to types are now based strictly on
		type and element names rather than on structural subsumption.
		</li> 
		<li>Backward compatibility with XPath Version 1.0 is now handled
		in a different way; fallback conversions have been eliminated,
		and an "XPath Version 1 Compatibility Mode" has been introduced
		that affects the semantics of certain functions and
		operators.</li>
   
 	<li>New and more liberal casting rules allow (for example) a
	 value of a derived atomic type to be cast into another derived
	 atomic type as long as the two types have a common supertype.
	 Furthermore, a new form of predicate called castable can now
	 be used to determine if a given value can be cast into a given
	 target type without raising an error.</li>
	<li> Variables may now be added to the static and dynamic
	context by the environment external to the query or
	transformation.</li>
	<li> New material has been added describing how errors are
	handled and how optimizers are allowed certain flexibility in
	evaluating an expression.</li>

</ul>

</dd>

<dt><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-xquery-20021115/">XQuery 1.0: An XML Query Language</a></dt><dd>

<p>In addition to the changes listed above for XPath 2.0,
</p>

<ul>
	<li>The sort by expression has been eliminated and in its place a new order by clause has been added to the FLWR expression (which is now the FLWOR expression). </li>
    <li>New syntax for explicit construction of text nodes.</li>
    <li>An optional "positional variable" has been added to the for-clause of a FLWOR expression, to capture the position of each variable binding in the iteration sequence.</li>
</ul>

</dd>


<dt><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-xmlquery-use-cases-20021115/">XML Query Use Cases</a></dt><dd>

<p>
The primary change here is that all the examples now use the new XQuery syntax with 
order by clauses instead of sortby(). For example,
</p>

<pre><code>&lt;bib>
  {
    for $b in document("http://www.bn.com/bib.xml")//book
    where $b/publisher = "Addison-Wesley" and $b/@year > 1991
    order by $b/title
    return
        &lt;book>
            { $b/@year }
            { $b/title }
        &lt;/book>
  }
&lt;/bib></code></pre>

</dd>


<dt><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-xquery-operators-20021115/">XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0 Functions and Operators</a></dt><dd>

<ul>
<li>
A user-definable error function is called
 "whenever the semantics being described encounter an error other than a static type error."</li>
<li>"There has been some amplification of the rules for constructing simple types and for casting (see section 4 Constructor Functions and section 16 Casting Functions). This work is not yet complete and will be further elaborated in forthcoming versions of this specification."</li>
</ul>

</dd>

<dt><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-xslt20-20021115/">XSL Transformations (XSLT) Version 2.0</a></dt><dd>

<p>
The <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-xslt20-20021115/#changes-in-
this-draft">changes</a> here are fairly minor and technical. The
big one is that there is no longer a principal result tree. All
"result trees now have the same status, though there is still an
initial result tree created implicitly if the stylesheet does
not create one using <code>xsl:result-document</code>." In
addition, <code>xsl:output</code> supports Unicode
normalization, and the <code>type</code> attribute of several
elements has been renamed <code>as</code>.
</p>

</dd>


<dt><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-query-semantics-20021115/">XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0 Formal Semantics</a></dt><dd>
    
<ul>
	<li>    The type system only uses named typing which
	removes the need for structural matching on sequence types.</li>
    
	<li>    Some fixes to the semantics of function calls and operators.</li>
	<li>    Some fixes to the semantics of path expressions.</li>

The W3C Patent Policy Working Group has posted the last call
working draft of the W3C <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-patent-policy-20021114">
Royalty-Free Patent Policy</a>. Bottom line: "In order to
promote the widest adoption of Web standards, W3C seeks to issue
Recommendations that can be implemented on a Royalty-Free (RF)
basis. Under this policy, W3C will not approve a Recommendation
if it is aware that Essential Claims exist which are not
available on Royalty-Free terms." The word "Royalty-Free" is
actually being used in a slightly unusual way here. To better
understand the implications, replace "Royalty-Free" with
"Zero-Cost".

The W3C SVG Working Group has posted proposed recommendations of
the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/PR-SVG11-20021115/">Scalable
Vector Graphics (SVG) 1.1 Specification</a>. The abstract says,
"SVG 1.1 serves two purposes: to provide a modularization of SVG
based on SVG 1.0 and to include the errata found so far in SVG
1.0." A <a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/Test/">test
suite</a> is now provided for SVG.
</p>

<p>
The SVG Working Group has simultaneously posted
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/PR-SVGMobile-20021115/">Mobile SVG Profiles: SVG Tiny and SVG Basic</a>. 
SVG Tiny is a stripped down version of SVG for cell phones.
SVG Basic is a slightly larger version of SVG for PDAs. 
Comments on both specs are due by
December 20th.
</p>

<p>
The same working group has also posted the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-SVG12-20021115/">first public working
draft of Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) 1.2</a>. This is very
preliminary, but possible new features for this version include:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>A <code>flowText</code> element for wrapping text inside shapes</li>
	<li>XForms support</li>
	<li>XML Events support</li>
	<li>More SMIL features possibly including audio, video, transitions and enhanced timing controls.</li>
<li>Rendering Arbitrary XML inside SVG documents using style sheets</li>
<li>A printing profile</li>
<li>Enhanced Alpha Compositing</li>
<li>Z-indexes not based on document order</li>
<li>Streaming enhancements</li>
<li>The <code>solidColor</code> element is a paint server that
provides a single color with opacity. It can be referenced like
the other paint servers (gradients and patterns).</li>
<li>Background fills</li>
<li>Keyboard navigation between picture elements</li>
<li> DOM Access to Images</li>
<li>Conversion of Mouse Coordinates to
the corresponding user space coordinates</li>
<li> DOM Level 3 Events</li>
<li>A standard <code>SVGWindow</code> interface</li>
</ul>

<p>
The W3C DOM Working Group has released the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/PR-DOM-Level-2-HTML-20021108">proposed
recommendation of Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2 HTML
Specification</a>. The abstract states,  "This specification defines the
Document Object Model Level 2 HTML, a platform- and language-neutral
interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and
update the content and structure of [HTML 4.01] and [XHTML 1.0]
documents. The Document Object Model Level 2 HTML builds on the Document
Object Model Level 2 Core [DOM Level 2 Core] and is not backward
compatible with DOM Level 1 HTML [DOM Level 1]." Comments are due by
October 16.

The W3C/IETF joint XML Signature Working Group has released the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/REC-xmldsig-filter2-20021108/">XML-Signature
XPath Filter 2.0 Recommendation</a>. According to, the abstract, "XML
Signature [XML-DSig] recommends a standard means for specifying
information content to be digitally signed and for representing the
resulting digital signatures in XML. Some applications require the
ability to specify a subset of a given XML document as the information
content to be signed. The XML Signature specification meets this
requirement with the XPath transform. However, this transform can be
difficult to implement efficiently with existing technologies. This
specification defines a new XML Signature transform to facilitate the
development of efficient document subsetting implementations that
interoperate under similar performance profiles."

<p>
The W3C XML Linking Working Group has posted proposed recommendations of three
 XPointer specifications:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/PR-xptr-framework-20021113/">XPointer Framework</a> </li>	
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/PR-xptr-xmlns-20021113/">XPointer xmlns() Scheme</a></li>	
	<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/PR-xptr-element-20021113/">XPointer element() Scheme</a> </li>

</ul>

<p>
	The biggest change in these drafts is that non-W3C-defined scheme
	names must be namespace qualified, and those namespaces must be
	defined by xmlns parts. Simon St. Laurent has been <a
	href="http://lists.xml.org/archives/xml-dev/200211/msg00467.html">pointing
	out</a> on the xml-dev mailing list that this has stretched
	namespaces and qualified names pretty much well past  the breaking
	point. The syntax proposed is so horribly unusable that it
	effectively dooms any hope of extending XPointer from outside the
	W3C. It's becoming obvious that instead of going to recommendation,
	XPointer should be tabled, and work on an XML addressing syntax for
	URI fragment identifiers should begin again from scratch.
	Unfortunately, the working group's charter expires at the end of the
	year, and they seem to prefer putting out a deeply flawed spec to
	putting out nothing at all.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
	Opera Software has posted the <a
	href="http://www.opera.com/download/index.dml?opsys=windows&amp;platform=windows&amp;lng=en&amp;ver=7.0b1">first
	public beta of Opera 7.0 for Windows</a>, a $39 payware web browser
	that supports XML and CSS. This version is allegedly faster and more
	standards compliant. There's also a new e-mail client. There don't
	seem to be a lot of other impressive new features.

</p>
<hr />
<p>
The Mozilla Project has posted
version <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/chimera/releasenotes.html">0.6</a> of <a
	href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/chimera/">Chimera</a>,
a small footprint, native Cocoa Mac OS X web browser  based on Mozilla's
Gecko layout engine that includes lots of XML support. Unlike Mozilla,
this is only a browser: no e-mail client, news reader, chat program, or
dog walker. Changes in 0.6 include "improvements to plugins, keychain
support, better cookie management, and Talkback support."
</p>

<hr />
<p>
IBM's alphaWorks has updated their <a
href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/xfc">XSL Formatting Objects
Composer</a>, "a typesetting and display engine that implements a
substantial portion of XSL Formatting Objects", to improve  memory,
speed, and performance as well as handling larger input documents.
However, it doesn't handle quite as much of the XSL spec as earlier
versions.

cover" border="0" width="240" height="301" hspace="7" vspace="5"
align="left" /></a><p> I am pleased to announce the official publication
of <a href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xmljava/">Processing XML
with Java</a>. This is the most comprehensive and up-to-date book about
integrating XML with Java (and vice versa) you can buy. It contains over
1000 pages of detailed information on SAX, DOM, JDOM, JAXP, TrAX, XPath,
XSLT, SOAP, and lots of other juicy acronyms. This book is written for
Java programmers who want to learn how to read and write XML documents
from their code.
</p>

<p>
Normally, this is the point where I'd spend a few paragraphs describing
just what's in the book and how important it is to your education, your
career, and your love life; but this time I've done something a little
different. The entire book is <a
href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xmljava/">available online</a>.
You can read every chapter and every page so you can see for yourself 
how well this book answers your questions such as, "<a
href="http://cafeconleche.org/books/xmljava/chapters/ch06s07.html">Why
does SAX truncate  the text in my documents after a few thousand
characters?</a>", "<a
href="http://cafeconleche.org/books/xmljava/chapters/ch13.html">How do I
serialize a DOM <code>Document</code> object in an
implementation-independent way?</a>", or, "<a
href="http://www.mentalwardfilm.com/falcon1.htm">Why doesn't my
significant other understand the importance of a building a life size
Millennium Falcon in our backyard?</a>". Consequently, I'll forego the
usual hype. Check the book out for yourself; and if you like it, please
buy a copy. I promise it's cheaper than printing all 1100+ pages on your
laser printer.
</p>

<p>
I received my copy yesterday, and <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN%3D0201771861/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/">Amazon</a>
is reporting that it will be in stock tomorrow. They do have the wrong
list price. It's $54.99, not $69.50, but their actual price is a quite
reasonable $48.65. <a
href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0201771861">Barnes
&amp; Noble</a> shows the list price as $49.99 (also wrong) and is
selling it at $39.99. You may want to pre-order your copy today, because
their initial shipments of my books tend to sell out very quickly once I
announce them here. If you missed the first batch, don't worry. Addison
Wesley will ship more very quickly. It does not normally take the
advertised "2-3 weeks". Brick and mortar stores should have their copies
very soon as well.
</p>

<p>
I'm heading off to 
Europe later today for a much needed vacation. (Well, a working vacation anyway. I'll be stopping by the <a href="http://www.bejug.org/index.jsp">Javapolis conference</a> in Antwerp next Wednesday, November 13, to talk about <cite>Refactoring Java</cite> and the <cite>Top 10 Myths About Java I/O</cite>. It's only &euro;150; and looks to be a really fun show. If you're not too far from Antwerp, check it out.)
Consequently, updates will be slow to non-existent here for the next week.
If you think I planned this just so my book hype would be front page news 
here for a week, well, OK. You caught me. :-)
In the meantime, why don't you check out 
<a href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xmljava/">Processing XML with Java</a>. If you like what you see, you can buy it at 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN%3D0201771861/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/">Amazon</a> or any other purveyor of fine computer books.

In an unrelated note, elharo.com is down for the time being due to

<a href="http://spacemapper.sf.net/">SpaceMapper - DataStore</a> is an open source
"document repository server for storing,
querying and fetching XML based documents. It is built on practical
needs allowing the storage of semi-structured (well formatted, maybe
validated, XML, XHTML and HTML) documents and un-structured documents (TXT)."
The documents are stored in conventional relational databases such as
PostgreSQL, MySQL, or DB2. Space Mapper is wwritten in Java
on top of the
Avalon Phoenix framework. The documents are managed through BEEP
 and/or XML-RPC interface using a subset of the  Simple
Exchange Profile (SEP) protocol.
</p>

<p>
SpaceMapper includes MN8, "an experimental object oriented scripting
language, tightly integrated with the net, which emulates the concepts
at the core of XML in order to simplify and make as transparent as
possible information extraction and manipulation from the WWW and XML
documents." To give you a bit of the flavor of the language, here's the
first example from <a
href="http://spacemapper.sourceforge.net/mn8/tutorial/concepts.html">the
tutorial</a> that defines a "concept" (an MN8 programming structure that
would probably be called a class in most languages) for a
<code>Person</code>:
</p>

<pre><code># -------- Person.mn8 ---------
define Person label "PersonalPersonDefinition" [
	@firstName
	@lastName	typeof String label "lastName"
	email label "Email.Address"
	address [
		street
		city
		state	
		country [

	]
	
	: getMyPerson [
		@firstName = "Remus"
		@lastName = "Pereni"
		/email = "remus@nolimits.ro"
		/address/street = "Some street"
		/address/city = "Satu Mare"
		/address/state = "no state J"
		/address/country@code = "RO"
		/address/country/value = "Romania"
	]
	
	static : main ( $args typeof Series ) [
		$me typeof Person
		$me.getMyPerson
		print $me.toXML

Opera Software has posted the second beta of 
<a href="http://www.opera.com/download/index.dml?platform=mac">Opera 6.0 for MacOS and Mac OS X</a>. This release adds shared library support and enables Java in the classic MacOS,
but offers no major new features in the XML space. It still
supports direct display of XML with CSS stylesheets. XSL is

I've posted version 1.0d8 of <a
href="http://cafeconleche.org/XOM">XOM</a>, my open source,
tree-based Java API for processing XML that strives for strict
compliance to the XML specs. There are no breaking changes in
this release. The big new feature is that XSLT works (modulo
some obscure bugs in handling the undeclaration of the default
namespace. I need to get some clarification on the proper
behavior of SAX processors to fix this.) As part of supporting
XSLT, I discovered a need to undeclare the default namespace on
a prefixed element. That is <code>&lt;pre:name
xmlns:pre="http://www.example.com" xmlns=""&gt;</code>. You can
now do this by passing an empty string for both the prefix and
URI to <code>declareNamespace()</code>.
</p>

<p>
I'm travelling quite a bit in November so this is probably the
last release until next month. The API, however, is starting to
feel quite stable to me. Most of the things on my to do list
involve implementation details, testing, documentation,
benchmarking, optimization, and the like. One of the places I'm
travelling this month is the SD Expo show in Boston. I'll be
hosting a Birds of a Feather session there on "What's Wrong with
XML APIs and How to Fix Them." I expect this to be more
interactive than the XML SIG session in September.

Gal Binyamini has released <a href="http://jxv.sourceforge.net">JXV</a>,
an open source library that allows Java objects to be given "XML Views",
and for those views to be read back into objects. (This strikes me as a
little more plausible than the other direction in which you start with
an XML document and build a custom Java object around it.) Essentially,
this is another variation of object serialization using XML. JXV
supports SAX input and output and DOM output. According to Binyamini,
</p>

<blockquote>
JXV uses a pluggable architecture which allows XML view factories to be
configured and loaded at runtime. The JXV configuration mechanisms also
leverage XML namespaces to allow the configurations for those different
view factories to be inlined within the JXV configuration file. In this
release, JXV comes pre-configured with view factories for JavaBeans,
collections, array, and "flat objects" such as Strings, primitives, etc.
These factories support a wide variety of configuration options, and are
sufficient for most object models. Future versions of JXV will include
pre-configured support for additional factories. JXV may also release
special-purpose factories (such as ones providing views for RowSets,
ResultSets and other JDBC structures) as extension packages.

Sun's posted a <a href="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/earlyAccess/xml/jaxb/">beta of the
Java Architecture for XML Binding 1.0 (JAXB)</a> on the Java Developer Connection (registration required).
JAXB compiles
 an XML schema into one or more Java classes. 
 (First mistake: JAXB assume there's a schema. 
 Second mistake: It assumes the schema is written in 
  the W3C XML Schema Language.
 Third  mistake: It assumes  
 documents actually adhere to the schema.)
 JAXB can 
 unmarshal schema-valid XML into Java objects;
 	read, update and validate the Java objects
 	 against  the schema, and write the result back out as XML.

IETF Internet-Draft that defines an <code>xpath1()</code> scheme
for use inside the W3C's XPointer Framework. In essence this is
the same as the existing <code>xpointer()</code> scheme after
subtracting points and ranges. For example, today's news on Cafe
con Leche could be identified as
<code>http://www.cafeconleche.org/#xpath1(//today)</code>. The
news for Monday, October 28, could be
<code>http://www.cafeconleche.org/#xpath1(//*%5B@id='

<dt><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-css3-box-20021024">CSS3 module: The box model</a></dt><dd>
<p>
 According to the abstract:</p>
 
 <blockquote>
<p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) describe the rendering of documents on
various media. When <em>textual</em> documents (e.g., HTML, WML) are laid out
on <em>visual</em> media (e.g., screen, paper), CSS represents the elements
of the document by rectangular boxes that are laid out one after the other or
nested inside each other in an ordering that is called a <em>flow.</em> This
module describes the characteristics of the flow and of the various kinds of
boxes.</p>

	<p>The flow includes <span title="floating box">"floating"</span>
	boxes, but tables [CSS3TBL] and "absolute" and "fixed" positioning
	[CSS3POS] are described in other modules. Also, the rules for
	partitioning a flow into pages (for paged media) is described
	elsewhere [CSS3PAGE], as are the special boxes for ruby annotations
	[CSS3RUBY] and the multicolumn layouts [CSS3COL].</p>

<p>The box model builds on the inline text modules ([CSS3TEXT]
and [CSS3LINE]), that describe how text is laid out on a
line, including treatment of superscripts, bidirectional ("bidi")
and
vertical text.</p>

<p>The flow can be horizontal (typical for most languages), but in level 3 of
CSS, flows can also be vertical (typical for the Uighur script and often used
for ideographic scripts).</p>

The W3C Voice Browser Working Group has published the second
working draft of
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-ccxml-20021011/">Voice
Browser Call Control: CCXML Version 1.0</a>. According to the
spec 
abstract, "CCXML is designed to provide telephony call control
support for VoiceXML or other dialog systems. CCXML has been
designed to complement and integrate with a 
VoiceXML system. Because of this you will find many references to
VoiceXML's capabilities and limitations. You will also find
details on how 
VoiceXML and CCXML can be integrated. However it should be noted
that the two languages are separate and are not required in an
implementation of either language. For example CCXML could be
integrated with a more traditional IVR system and VoiceXML or
other dialog systems could be integrated with some other call
control systems."

<a
	href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-DOM-Level-3-Core-20021022/">Document
	Object Model (DOM) Level 3 Core Specification</a>.
	The biggest new feature in this release seems to be support for providing type information for attributes and elements.
DTD types are provided for attributes. Schema types are provided for both elements and attributes.
Unlike the recently killed abstract schemas effort, the approach taken (just provide a type name and URI for each node) seems much more extensible and much less tied to particular schema languages.  I think this is a clear case of doing something better by doing less.

The Mozilla Project has posted the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/releases/">first
 beta of Mozilla 1.2</a>, an
 open source web browser that supports XML, simple 
 XLinks, MathML, CSS, XSLT, XHTML, XUL, SVG, and many other cool acronyms. 
 Most importantly it lets you turn off pop-up ads and block web bugs and cookies in a sensible way. 
(IE claims to let you manage your cookies, but it only works about 80%.
Mozilla's cookie management is much smoother.) 
New features in this beta include:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Link prefetching</li>
	<li>"Filter after the fact"  for mail already received</li>
	<li>Show toolbars as text/icons/both, has been implemented. </li>
	<li>You can launch the browser with a bookmark group as your start page. This loads several pages into tabs at startup. </li>
</ul>


<p>
Most importantly for me personally, this release finally fixes a long standing <a
href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=138768">AppleScript bug</a> that prevented me from switching over to Mozilla on the Mac. I can finally remove IE from my work chain completely. Update: I spoke too soon. That bug is indeed fixed, but as often happens in software development, fixing one bug reveals <a
href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=175275">another</a>.
This one isn't as bad as the last one&mdash;it only affects the quote of the day, not the recommended reading&mdash;but it still means Mozilla can't do quite everything I need it to do. 
</p>

<p>
Other features added since 1.1 include
 "Type Ahead Find" and a
pretty printed 
raw XML view, like that found in Internet Explorer. 
XML pretty printing is only available in the
.zip distribution and
 is turned off by default because it affects the DOM for unstyled XML-pages. To turn it on, add user_pref("layout.xml.prettyprint", true); to your user.js file.

The W3C Web Services Architecture Working Group
has published the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-wsa-reqs-20021011">third public working draft of
 Web Services Architecture Requirements</a>.
 According to the abstract,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
 The use of Web services on the World Wide Web is expanding rapidly as the need for application-to-application communication and interoperability grows. These services provide a standard means of communication among different software applications involved in presenting dynamic context-driven information to the user. In order to promote interoperability and extensibility among these applications, as well as to allow them to be combined in order to perform more complex operations, a standard reference architecture is needed. The Web Services Architecture Working Group at W3C is tasked with producing this reference architecture.
</p>

<p>
This document describes a set of requirements for a standard reference architecture for Web services developed by the Web Services Architecture Working Group. These requirements are intended to guide the development of the reference architecture and provide a set of measurable constraints on Web services implementations by which conformance can be determined.

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
My favorite part of this document is that it actually defines what the heck a web service is:
</p>

<blockquote>
Definition: A Web service is a software application identified by a URI, whose interfaces and bindings are capable of being defined, described, and discovered as XML artifacts. A Web service supports direct interactions with other software agents using XML based messages exchanged via internet-based protocols.
</blockquote>

<p>
In the past, I've noticed that how a web service is defined often depends on what a vendor is trying to sell me.
Notably absent from this definition is any requirement to use HTTP, SOAP, WSDL, UDDI, 
or similar FLAs (four-letter acronyms). 
</p>
<hr />

<p>
On a related note for all the developers who keep asking me to announce their web services products (and you are legion): if you want your product announced here you need to be able to explain in one paragraph what the product is and what it does. (Also required: what platforms it runs on and what it costs, though those requirements don't seem to be causing people as much trouble as explaining what their products actually do.) Do not use adjectives or adverbs, especially comparatives or superlatives (better, faster, more robust, efficiently, etc.). Do not define your product by comparison to some other product since  I probably don't know what that product does either. Do not use  buzzwords like "web services" or "application server". (I once walked across an Internet World show floor asking each and every booth selling an "application server" what an application server was. Most frequent answer: "If you come back later, the right person to answer your question will be here.") Explain in plain language what your product  does and why a developer might need such a thing. 
</p>

<p>
An example of what not to send me, adapted from a recent e-mail (names changed to protect the guilty, and because they're hardly the only group in this space that can't seem to explain what they're doing):
</p>

<blockquote>
Cherokee Allies 1.0, the Open Source product of the XML Cherokee Group is now released. Allies, which
Cherokee's John Doe likes to call "Cherokee SOAP 3.0", is quite a bit more powerful than Cherokee
SOAP 2.0. Like SOAP 2.0, Allies supports the latest SOAP 1.1 spec. However Allies also supports WSDL
1.1. Allies includes implementations of both the JAX-RPC and SOAP API with Attachments for Java
(SAAJ) specifications. Importantly, Allies is making some significant contributions with highly
useful features that promise to improve interoperability and capabilities of future Web services
as a whole.
</blockquote>


<p>
An example of what to do:
</p>

<blockquote>
Cherokee Allies 1.0 is a generic server written in Java that communicates with remote clients by sending and receiving XML documents  over HTTP. 
These documents adhere to the SOAP 1.1, JAX-RPC, and SOAP API with Attachments for Java
(SAAJ) specifications.
Out of the box, Allies doesn't do much of anything.
Sites customize Allies by writing small Java programs called "foolets" that respond to particular kinds of SOAP messages. 
The foolets are written in Java, and can do essentially anything a Java program running on that server can do; for example, talk to a database with JDBC, read a file, send data to a printer connected to the parallel port, invert a matrix, etc. The results of the foolet's work are then transmitted back to the 
requesting client as another XML document.
The messages  the server understands and responds to are described by a WSDL document that client programmers can retrieve and inspect. 
Allies handles all the generic services involved in sending and receiving HTTP, 
marshalling and unmarshalling arguments to XML documents, and, optionally, supporting transactions. The foolet programmer can focus on the unique local logic of their system.
Client programs can be written in any language capable of generating and receiving XML documents over HTTP. 
Allies is published under the Cherokee license.

From the beast that wouldn't die department, the W3C XML Core Working Group has brought forth
the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/CR-xml11-20021015">candidate recommendation of XML 1.1</a>; and, surprise, surprise,
it's even worst than the last draft.
This release has a few big new features:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>C0 control characters such as form feed, vertical tab, BEL, 
	and DC1 through DC4 (whatever those are) are now allowed in XML text.
	However, they must be escaped as character references. They cannot be included literally in data. Nulls, thankfully, are still forbidden. </p>
	 </li>
	<li><p>The C1 control characters such as BPH, IND, NBH, and PU1 are no longer  allowed as literals in XML text. They too must now be escaped as character references. For the first time this means that some well-formed XML 1.0 documents are not well-formed XML 1.1 documents. The exception, of course, is IBM's holy grail of NEL, which will be allowed in literal XML text, just to make life difficult for every text editor on the planet except those from IBM mainframes.  </p>
	 </li>
	<li><p>Unicode character normalization should be performed on XML documents, unless you don't feel like it, in which case you can ignore it. This almost makes sense. Basically it says that parsers may report an e followed by a combining accent acute instead of the single character &eacute; 
	as an error of unspecified type if they want to or the client asks
	for it. The details are quite complicated, but at least it's
	optional. However, I still worry that this is a source of
	interoperability problems, especially when it comes to names of
	elements and attributes. For instance, a normalizing validator might
	accept documents a non-normalizing validator would reject.
  </p>
	 </li>
</ul>

<p>
	And of course all the other problems previous drafts have had are
	still present. I've already calumnied these sufficiently in the
	past. Let me just reprint my criticisms now. What follows was
	originally posted on June 21, 2001. Regrettably, it's just as
	relevant today:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
This is a proposal for a new <strong>backwards incompatible</strong> 
 version of XML. The specific goal is to address some shortcomings of the XML 1.0 
character model relative to Unicode 3.1, as well as throwing a sop to IBM.
</p>


<p>
The concern with respect to IBM is that one of the world's largest corporations,
with thousands of patents, legions of programmers, billions of dollars in revenue, 
and resources pouring out of every orifice is somehow unable to handle 
documents where lines end with carriage returns and line feeds,
as documents do on every non-IBM system on the planet. 
The only reason there's a problem here at all
 is because IBM tried to go it alone as a monopoly 
and set standards by fiat for years rather than  working with the rest of 
the industry. Consequently their mainframe character sets don't really interoperate well with
everybody else's character sets. In XML this arises as a 
problem with line endings when someone
edits an XML document with an IBM mainframe text editor. 
IBM mostly grew out of their anti-competitive monopolistic tendencies over 
the last thirty years (with a large dose of assistance from the U.S. 
 government). However, there are still some legacy issues relating to their 
 attempt to dictate standards to the rest of the industry, and this is one of them.
 Now rather than fixing their own broken mainframe text editing software,
 they want everyone else on the planet to change their software so IBM doesn't have 
 to. (If this reminds anybody of the current mess with Oracle and UTF-8, you're not alone.)
 This proposal was laughed out of the W3C a few months ago when IBM made it,
 or at least it seemed to be. However, it's now risen from the dead as part of 
 XML Blueberry; but it doesn't make any more sense now than it did then;
 and it still deserves to be laughed off the table with whooping cries of
 derision. 
</p>

<p>
The second proposal
for breaking backwards compatibility with existing parsers
 is much more serious, and requires a more thoughtful response. 
 Starting in Unicode 3.0 
 a number of new characters have been added both for new scripts that were 
 previously unencoded such as Amharic and Cherokee
as well as for old scripts that were incomplete such as Chinese.
 The concern is that since XML 1.0 is based on Unicode 2.0, 
"fully native-language XML markup is not possible in at least the following languages: Amharic,
          Burmese, Canadian aboriginal languages, Cantonese (Bopomofo script), Cherokee, Dhivehi, Khmer, Mongolian
          (traditional script), Oromo, Syriac, Tigre, Yi. In addition, Chinese, Japanese, Korean (Hangul script), and
          Vietnamese can make use of only a limited subset of their complete character repertoires."
 </p>
 
 
 <p>
 If this were true, it would be a very serious criticism of XML 1.0
Fortunately, however, the claim is not nearly as dire 
as the proposal makes out. Indeed the proposal substantially overstates the need
for any changes.
The XML 1.0 BNF productions do not allow these newly defined characters to be used in element,
attribute, and entity names. However, they can be used in the text of element content and attribute values. 
This means that XML is fully adequate for literature and data in
Amharic, Burmese, Canadian aboriginal languages, Cantonese, Cherokee, Dhivehi, Khmer, Mongolian, Oromo, Syriac, Tigre, Yi, Mandarin, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese. Only the markup, that is, the tags, would have to be written in another script. Given that there aren't even localized operating systems 
in most of these languages, and that today's software effectively 
requires users to have a solid knowledge of at least the ASCII characters, 
I don't think
the need to write markup (as opposed to text) in Cherokee justifies breaking 
backwards compatibility.
</p>

<p>
But wait! It's not even that bad.
Several of the languages listed are total red herrings.
You most certainly can write markup 
in Cantonese, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin, and Vietnamese today.
The new characters Unicode has added to these scripts are very obscure.
In fact, experts often disagree over whether some of them exist at all,
or are merely typographical variations of existing characters.
Since the 1700s Vietnamese has been written in a Latin-based alphabet that is fully available
in XML and that can write any Vietnamese word. Vietnamese
only uses the Han ideographs for classical documents and occasional signage or
decoration, and it seems very unlikely that a Vietnamese speaker would write
their markup using Han ideographs.   
Japanese has not one but two phonetic alphabets that can write any Japanese word if the right Han ideograph character is not encoded.
Chinese speakers can use either Latin characters or the native Bopomofo phonetic system for the very rare cases where a character they need is not encoded.
The fact is most native speakers of Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese do not recognize the vast majority of these new characters, and
the need for them in markup (again, as opposed to text) is non-existent. 
</p>


<p>
There are a few good points in this proposal. I'm sure there's an occasional need for writing markup in Amharic, Burmese, Khmer, Mongolian, Yi, and a few of the other languages the proposal lists. But I don't believe there's enough of a need to justify breaking compatibility with existing XML parsers, 
software, and systems. The XML Blueberry Requirements vastly overstate the case
 by ignoring the difference between <em>markup</em> and <em>text</em> in XML documents.  
I'd be willing to break backwards compatibility to allow text in
these languages if we had to, but we don't. Text is already adequately handled by XML 1.0. All we're arguing about now are the tags, and that's just not a strong enough reason to break backwards compatibility.

Patrick Durusau and Matthew Brook O'Donnell 
have published a paper on  <a href="http://sbl-site2.org/Extreme2002">Just-In-Time-Trees</a>.
The basic idea seems to be that you can extract subtrees of a document,
and use them as complete documents, while ignoring the rest of the document.
A Saxon 7.2 implementation is provided, though ideally a custom parser would be much more efficient.
John Cowan suggested something similar he calls "Shemp" for XOM
(after Simon St. Laurent's <a href="http://moe.sourceforge.net/">MOE</a>).
It's an interesting idea. 
Just-In-Time-Trees have the potential to be as easy to use as a tree-based API like JDOM or DOM while as fast and efficient as a streaming API like SAX or XMLPULL. I'm still trying to figure out exactly what the API for such a thing should look like
before I work on the implementation.

I've posted version 1.0d4 of <a href="XOM/">XOM</a>, my open source, tree-based library 
for processing XML with Java. XOM derives from my exxperience writing <a href="books/xmljava">Processing XML with Java</a>.
It attempts to  combine the best aspects of the existing APIs like DOM and JDOM, while removing a lot of their quirkiness.
</p>

<p>
The major addition in 1.0d4 are methods to get and set the base URI of a <code>Node</code>. You can invoke <code>getBaseURI</code> from any <code>Node</code> object to retrieve the URL against which relative URLs in that <code>Node</code> should be resolved. This is calculated in keeping with XML Base. That is, if an <code>xml:base</code> attribute is in scope its value is used. Otherwise, the URI of the entity in which the <code>Node</code> appears is loaded. You can change the underlying URI of the entity using the <code>setBaseURI</code> method in <code>ParentNode</code>. When a document is built, the parser fills in the base URI for each node. This is stored separately from <code>xml:base</code> attributes, which are not treated differently than any other attribute. When a document is serialized, you may request that the serializer fill in extra <code>xml:base</code> attributes not present in the infoset to preserve the underlying base URIs. However, since this is a structural change to the document, this feature is turned off by default. 
</p>

<p>
Beyond this, I expanded support for subclassing. Subclasses should now
be able to intercept essentially any modification to a <code>Node</code>.
(If you notice anywhere, that's not possible, it's an oversight. Please let me know so I can fix it.)
I replaced the <code>Attributes</code> and <code>Namespaces</code> class
with additional methods in <code>Element</code>.
A number of bugs were fixed, especially in serialization.
Finally, I renamed a number of methods to make their nature a little more obvious.

RealNetworks, Inc. has submitted a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/NOTE-xmcl-20020919/">note describing the
eXtensible Media Commerce Language (XMCL)</a> to the W3C. 
XMCL "is an interchange format that describes usage rules that apply to multi-media content. It is designed to communicate these rules in an implementation independent manner for interchange between business systems and DRM implementations responsible for enforcing the rules described in the language."
</p>

<p>
An 
XMCL document "describes the minimum, self-complete set of business rules under which digital media is licensed for consumer use. These business rules support multiple business models including rental, subscription, ownership, and video on demand/pay-per-view. When a business system authorizes a customer transaction for digital media, it generates a XMCL document that is then acted upon and enforced by a specific trusted system. The generated XMCL document is submitted to the trusted system through the APIs of the trusted system (e.g. HTTP POST, RPC call, API call).". For example, here's an XMCL document from the note that

The W3C Technical Architecture Group (TAG) has <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2002Sep/0183.html">concluded</a> that HLink is not 
consistent with the Web architecture.
It's not clear whether the TAG has the authority to veto anything 
(though one of its members does), but nonetheless this is a big vote against HLink.
Personally, I suspect this is correct. HLink is messy and confusing, and adds nothing significant to XHTML. 
Either old-style links or simple XLinks with some links moved to child elements seem
fully capable of meeting XHTML's needs. I don't see the problem HLink is trying to solve as anythign that actually needs solving.

The W3C XML Protocol Working Group has published a last call working draft
of the 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-soap12-af-20020924">SOAP
1.2 Attachment Feature</a>. According to the abstract, "This
document defines a SOAP feature that represents an abstract
model for SOAP attachments. It provides the basis for the
creation of SOAP bindings that transmit such attachments along
with a SOAP envelope, and provides for reference of those
attachments from the envelope. SOAP attachments are described
using the notion of a compound document structure consisting of
a primary SOAP message part and zero or more related documents
parts known as attachments."

The W3C XML Core Working Group has posted the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/CR-xinclude-20020917">second
candidate recommendation of XML Inclusions (XInclude) Version
1.0</a>. The syntax is basically the same as in the last draft.
However, now an XInclude procesor is allowed to claim full
conformance even if it only supports the <code>element()</code>
scheme of XPointer. Support for full, XPath based XPointers is
optional. In addition, namespace fixup has been changed. In
particular, it is suggested but not required that
implementations not include namespace attributes in the merged
document. However, implementations are reuired to preserve
in-scope namespaces, which can only be done in most cases via
namespace attributes. Catch-22. Comments are due by November 1.

 <p>
 Last night at the New York XML SIG meeting, I unveiled <a
 href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/XOM/">XOM</a>, a new XML Object Model
 for Java published under the LGPL. Like DOM, JDOM, dom4j, and
 ElectricXML, XOM is a read/write API that represents XML documents as
 trees of nodes. Where XOM diverges from these models is that it strives
 for absolute correctness and maximum simplicity. XOM is based on more
 than two years' experience with JDOM development, as well as the last
 year's effort writing <cite><a
 href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xmljava/">Processing XML with
 Java</a></cite>. While documenting the various APIs I found lots of
 things to like and not like about all the APIs, and XOM is my effort to
 synthesize the best features of the existing APIs while eliminating the
 worst. It's closest in spirit to JDOM. I had originally intended to
 fork JDOM, but it rapidly became apparent that very little actual JDOM
 code would be left when I was done and that starting from scratch would
 give me a flexibility I wouldn't have by using the existing JDOM code
 base. There is one non-public class hidden deep in the bowels of the
 API that uses some JDOM code (taken from, not coincidentally, the
 single JDOM class I was most personally responsible for) but otherwise,
 XOM was written starting with a blank screen.
</p>

<p>
I also attempted to write XOM according to a more modern understanding
of Java in particular and API design in general than I had two years ago
when JDOM was started. I've spent a lot of time over the last year
thinking about the ideas of (and in some cases arguing with) Bruce
Eckel, Joshua Bloch, Bertrand Meyer, Ken Arnold, Erich Gamma, Kent Beck,
Martin Fowler, and other design savants, sometimes in person, sometimes
in e-mail, sometimes just in my own head. It may not be obvious  at
first glance, but these gurus collectively had a huge effect on the
overall design of the API. For instance, Joshua Bloch's <cite><a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN%3D0201310058/ref%3Dnosim/
cafeaulaitA/">Effective Java</a></cite> gave me the courage to ignore
the <code>Cloneable</code> interface and give my classes copy
constructors instead. Bloch and Bruce Eckel together convinced me that
many of the exceptions in XOM deserved to be runtime exceptions, not
checked exceptions, a decision that makes a lot of code much cleaner.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The actual release date snuck up on me about a week earlier than I
    was  expecting, and although the software was ready, not all the
    supporting documentation, mailing lists, CVS repository, web
    servers, etc. was, so I'm going to be filling a lot of that in
    today. <strong>Update:</strong> The <a
    href="http://lists.ibiblio.org/pipermail/xom-interest/">XOM-interest
    mailing list</a> is now live. You can subscribe by sending e-mail to
    <a
    href="mailto:xom-interest-request@lists.ibiblio.org?Subject=subscribe">xom-interest-request@lists.ibiblio.org</a> with just the
    word "subscribe" in the subject or body. or by filling in this <a
    href="http://lists.ibiblio.org/mailman/listinfo/xom-interest">form</a>. 
    This is a general discussion and development mailing list. For
    now, everyone's invited. Once XOM is more stable, I'll probably
    split out separate xom-development and xom-users lists, but it's too
    early in XOM's life cycle right now for the distinction to matter
    that much. The current web site on Cafe con Leche is temporary. I 
    will eventually move it to its own domain at www.xom.nu, but I'll be
    sure to leave an automatic redirect behind when that happens.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In the meantime, if you're curious you can start by browsing the <a
    href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/XOM/doc/">JavaDocs</a> or looking
    over the notes from last night's <a
    href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/XOM/whatswrong/">presentation</a>
    to the New York XML SIG. I consider the current version to be 1.0d1.
    In other words, the API is still open for discussion and change.
    Depending on what people think, it could take more or less time to
    reach an API freeze and begin an alpha and beta cycle. I do very
    much want to hear feedback. I'm going to try to get some mailing
    lists set up very quickly so we can have an ongoing discussion and
    back and forth, but that may take me a day or two. In the meantime,
    please keep good notes on any comments you have. :-)

Sun's posted public draft 0.7 of the
 <a href="http://java.sun.com/xml/downloads/jaxb.html">Java 
 Architecture for XML Binding (JAXB) specification</a> in the Java Community Process. 
 JAXB compiles
 an XML schema into one or more Java classes. 
 (First mistake: JAXB assume there's a schema. 
 Second mistake: It assumes the schema is written in 
  the W3C XML Schema Language.
 Third  mistake: It assumes  
 documents actually adhere to the schema.)
 JAXB can 
 unmarshal schema-valid XML into Java objects;
 	read, update and validate the Java objects
 	 against  the schema, and write the result back out as XML.
Changes since the last 0.21 release include:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Support for a subset of W3C XML Schema and XML Namespaces</li>
	<li>More flexible unmarshalling and marshalling functionality</li>

The W3C HTML Working Group has published a working draft of <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-hlink-20020913/">HLink: Link
recognition for the XHTML Family</a>. The basic idea is to add an
<code>hlink</code> element to the <code>head</code> that identifies the
type of link attributes on particular elements in the document. For
example, the draft gives this <code>hlink</code> element as a definition
for the classic <code>a</code> link:
</p>

<pre><code>&lt;hlink namespace="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
  element="a"
  locator="@href"
  effect="replace"
  actuate="onRequest"
  replacement="@target"/></code></pre>


<p>
Hlink  spits in the face of XLink. It starts the whole linking process
over from scratch with a  completely incompatible syntax. It is based on
some deep problems the HTML working group has with XLink. In particular,
</p>

<ul>
	<li>The HTML working group is unwilling to consider extended links.
	    They insist on including multiple link attributes on single elements. </li>
	<li>The HTML working group does not like the semantics XLink defines. </li>
</ul>

<p>
Because of the ongoing sniping between the XLink and HTML camps, this
draft has a bit of a polemical feel to it. If you're not up on the
intricacies of W3C politics, I recommend you keep a few things in mind
while reading this:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>This draft makes several mistakes in interpreting the semantics of XLink attributes. 
	Do not trust what it says XLink can and cannot 
or does or does not mean. </p></li>
	<li><p>This draft's  XLink solutions are a lot uglier and more
	verbose than they would have to be in practice. Many of the examples
	could be reduced to a single <code>xlink:href</code> attribute,
	which would significantly reduce the "Yuck" factor that led to HLink
	in the first place. </p></li>
	<li><p>Any version of HTML that incorporates either XLink or HLink
	will be  incompatible with existing browsers and systems, completely
	aside from  linking issues. For instance, the <code>img</code> 
	element is being eliminated in XHTML 2.0 and frames are rewritten
	from scratch. Given this fact,  backwards compatibility is not
	really a selling feature for either XLink or HLink. 
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
I haven't yet made up my mind about this. 
There are some interesting ideas here. Just read the draft with a large 
bag of salt close at hand.

Design Science has released <a
href="http://www.dessci.com/webmath/mathplayer/">MathPlayer 1.0</a>, a 
free-beer MathML plug-in for Internet Explorer on Windows. I'm told it
supports both content and presentation markup. Web pages need to include
special elements and processing instructions to use MathPlayer; for
example,
</p>

<pre><code>&lt;head>
   &lt;OBJECT ID=behave1 CLASSID="clsid:32F66A20-7614-11D4-BD11-00104BD3F987">&lt;/OBJECT>
   &lt;?IMPORT NAMESPACE="M" IMPLEMENTATION="#behave1" ?>
   &lt;title>Page with Math&lt;/title>
&lt;/head></code></pre>

<p>
MathPlayer cannot display an arbitrary page containing some MathML. This
is not how MathML is supposed to work. This seems likely to be due to
limitations in the IE plug-in API.

First, go read Bill Venners' <a
href="http://www.artima.com/intv/perfectP.html">interview</a> with Ken
Arnold quoted above.  Then mark your calendar for Tuesday September 17,
because I've been thinking along similar lines for a while, and one week
from tonight, at at the New York XML Special Interest Group meeting in
Manhattan, I'll be unveiling a new XML API that follows a lot of the
principles Arnold outlines in his interview, including:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Give developers what they need, not what they want.</li>
	<li>Simplicity counts.</li>
	<li>Human factors matter in API design.</li>
	<li>It's OK to raise complexity for implementers in order to lower complexity for users.</li>
   <li>A library should make it easy to do the right thing and difficult to impossible to do the wrong thing.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  I think most existing XML APIs violate one or more of these rules. 
  DOM violates all of them, and quite a few more besides.
  I believe something better is possible, and on the 17th I intend to prove it.
  If you're curious, and you'd like to be in the audience,
  just drop a note to <a href="mailto:wperry@xml-sig.org">Walter Perry</a>
  to reserve a spot. The meeting begins at 7:00 P.M. at the

requires that those attending this meeting be registered at least a day
in advance so that their names are available to check against attendance
at the door. Please register before Monday 16 September to insure that
you will be admitted.

listed on the web site are wrong.) Once again I'll be chairing the XML
track. XML-wise this conference tends to focus on more practical, how-to
sessions rather than a typical XML conference, which runs more advanced
and theoretical sessions.
</p>

<p>
We're looking for sessions that speak to programmers who are not
necessarily XML experts but need to learn how to use SAX, DOM,
namespaces, XSLT, schemas, etc.
We're not as focused on bleeding edge topics and research projects as
the more XML-specific shows. We're looking for ninety minute seminars,
and half-day and full-day tutorials. If you haven't presented at this
show before, you're much more likely to get picked for one or two ninety
minute sessions than for a half or full-day session. We like to get to
know speakers with a smaller session first.

The W3C RDF Core Working Group
has posted the first public working draft of the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-rdf-concepts-20020829/">Resource Description Framework (RDF):
Concepts and Abstract Data Model</a>.
According to their abstract:
</p>

<blockquote>
The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a data format for
representing metadata about Web resources, and other information. This
document defines the abstract graph syntax on which RDF is based, and
which serves to link its XML serialization to its formal semantics. It
also describes some other technical aspects of RDF that do not fall
under the topics of formal semantics, XML serialization syntax or RDF
schema and vocabulary definitions (which are each covered by a separate
document in this series). These include: discussion of design goals,
meaning of RDF documents, key concepts, character normalization and
handling of URI references.

of
his <a href="http://www.apache.org/~andyc/neko/doc/index.html">CyberNeko
Tools</a> for the Xerces Native Interface 
(NekoXNI). This is a collection of XML tools
written specifically to take advantage of the XNI API
in Xerces2 including the  
NekoHTML parser and the  NekoDTD parser.
This release is now compatible with
Xerces 2.1.0 and fixes a  bug in NekoPull that prevented processing

The W3C Core XML Working Group has published the last call working draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-xml-names11-20020905">Namespaces in XML 1.1</a>.
The main changes since Namespaces 1.0 are:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>IRIs are used instead of URIs. (IRIs can use non-ASCII characters like &Theta; without % escaping them.)</li>
	<li>The default namespace can be unset by using an <code>xmlns=""</code> attribute.</li>
  <li>The prefix <code>xmlns</code> is by definition bound to the namespace name http://www.w3.org/2000/xmlns/. </li>
</ul>

<p>
However, all of this only applies to XML 1.1 documents.
XML 1.0 documents must use Namespaces 1.0. 
Comments are due by September 28.

Interoperability Framework (xvif)</a>, "a proposal for embedding pipes of
transformations and validations within grammar based schema languages."
In contrast with document based piping approaches, this focuses on
 "micro-pipes" that operate on individual information
items such as  attributes, text nodes, elements and so forth.
The prototype is based on Relax NG  and Python. This release adds
"a basic yet general mechanism to plug in datatype libraries"
and fixes a couple of bugs.

Microsoft has released version 1.0  of the <a
href="http://www.GotDotNet.com/team/xmltools/xmldiff/">Microsoft
Xml Diff and Patch tool</a>. This is a set of Windows tools
written in C# that can compare  two XML documents and produce a 
"Diffgram" describing the differences between the two XML
documents. The XML Patch tool can use the diffgram to update
copies of the original document. XML Diff performs partially
XML-based comparison of the XML documents as opposite of a
common lexical comparison.  For instance, it ignores the
document encoding and the order of attributes. However, it does 
distinguish between empty element tags and empty elements with
two tags. This is a bug. Update: It seems that the tool actually
does treat empty element tags and empty elements with a start
and end-tag the same, even though the documentation claims
exactly the opposite.

The W3C Technical Architecture Group has published the first
public Working Draft of <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-webarch-20020830/">
Architectural Principles of the World Wide Web</a>. This
document attempts to lay out the basic principles that underlay
or should underlay what we normally call the Web. It describes
some limitations on protocols, formats, and resources.
</p>

<p>
	The main purpose is to inform development of future
	specifications and technologies such as SOAP, XHTML 2.0, and
	XForms so that different specs don't collide with each other or
	with the substructure of the Web. Past examples of the sorts of
	things this effort is trying to prevent in the future include
	SOAP's firewall tunnelling,
the unbookmarkability of HTML frames, and RDF's deep schizophrenia about URIs
	and resources. The goal is to bring some order to the current
	morass of often mutually contradictory specifications. In many
	ways this reminds me of the Infoset's effort to synchronize the
	different XML specifications. In the end, the need for
	backwards compatibility meant it only added to the confusion
	with yet another data model. It never successfully subsumed and
	unified the existing data models of different specs like XPath
	and DOM. This effort is even more ambitious, covering not just
	XML but the entire universe of Web related technology.

<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/releases/">Version 1.1 of Mozilla</a> has been released, a little to my surprise. 
Version 1.0 took so long that I wasn't expecting this till next year.
I guess the Mozilla folks have finally gotten their momentum going.
For anyone who's been in a cave for the last few years,
Mozilla is the open source web browser/news reader/e-mailer that supports HTML, XHTML, CSS, XML, XSLT, MathML, JavaScript, and lots more.
It has a very nice skinnable user interface with convenient features like
turning off pop-up ads and tabbed windows.
New features in 
version 1.1 include:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Full-screen mode on Linux</li>
<li>MathML support on the Mac</li>
<li>View source of selection</li>
<li>Display HTML mail as plaintext</li>
<li>Better bidirectional Arabic and Hebrew support</li>
<li>XBM image support</li>
<li>Image and plug-in blocking for Mail &amp; News</li>
<li>Quartz rendering for Mac OS X</li>
<li>Many assorted bug fixes, rendering improvements, and speedups</li>
</ul>

<p>
It's my browser of choice on Windows and Linux, and I'm just waiting for
one <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=119091">obscure

The W3C HTML Activity has posted the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-xforms-20020821/">second Last Call Working
Draft of XForms 1.0</a>. XForms are a new XML application that succeeds
HTML forms, and will be used in XHTML 2.0. According to the draft introduction, 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The primary difference when comparing XForms with HTML Forms,
apart from XForms being in XML, is the separation of the data being
collected from the markup of the controls collecting the individual
values. By doing this, it not only makes XForms more tractable by
making it clear what is being submitted where, it also eases reuse
of forms, since the underlying essential part of a Form is no
longer irretrievably bound to the page it is used in.</p>

<p>A second major difference is that XForms, while designed to be
integrated into XHTML, is no longer restricted only to be a part of
that language, but may be integrated into any suitable markup
language.</p>

<p>XForms has striven to improve authoring, reuse,
internationalization, accessibility, usability, and device
independence. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
For example, if I were to translate the subscription form on the <a href="mailinglists.html">mailing list page</a> to XForms, I would first place the following content in the header of the page, specifying what data is collected and sent to the server:
</p>

<pre><code>&lt;xforms:model id="devxml"
 xmlns:xforms="http://www.w3.org/2002/08/xforms/cr"
 xmlns:ml="http://namespaces.cafeconleche.org/mailinglists">
  &lt;xforms:instance>
    &lt;ml:subscription>
      &lt;ml:username />
      &lt;ml:realname />
      &lt;ml:listaddress>dev-xml-subscribe@onelist.com&lt;/ml:listaddress>
      &lt;ml:listtype>listserv&lt;/ml:listtype>
      &lt;ml:listname>dev-xml&lt;/ml:listname>
    &lt;/ml:subscription>
  &lt;/xforms:instance>
  &lt;xforms:submission action="/javafaq/cgi-bin/xmlmaillist.pl" method="post" id="subscribe" />
&lt;/xforms:model></code></pre>

<p>
The body of the document would then contain form controls like these
that provide data for particular elements defined in the model.
XPath expressions identify which elements 
and attributes get filled in with data from the form:
</p>

<pre><code>&lt;xforms:input ref="my:username" model="devxml">
  &lt;xforms:label>E-mail address&lt;/xforms:label>
&lt;/xforms:input>
&lt;xforms:input ref="my:realname" model="devxml">
  &lt;xforms:label>Name&lt;/xforms:label>
&lt;/xforms:input>
&lt;xforms:submit submission="subscribe">
  &lt;xforms:label>Submit&lt;/xforms:label>
&lt;/xforms:submit></code></pre>



<p>
Benefits include
</p>
<ul>
<li>Strong schema-based typing for data validation</li>
<li>Forms are submitted as XML documents that can easily be processed by XML tools. In fact, with a little effort it's not hard to make a form a
SOAP or XML-RPC request.</li>
<li>Easier internationalization</li>
<li>Enhanced accessibility </li>
<li>Greater device independence</li>
<li>Less scripting</li>
</ul>

BEA, Sun, SAP and Intalio have submitted a note to the W3C proposing 
a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/NOTE-wsci-20020808">Web Service Choreography Interface (WSCI)</a>.
According to the abstract,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p> The Web Service Choreography Interface (WSCI) is an XML-based
interface description language that describes the flow of messages
exchanged by a Web Service participating in choreographed interactions
with other services. </p>

<p> WSCI describes the dynamic interface of the Web Service
participating in a given message exchange by means of reusing the
operations defined for a static interface. WSCI works in conjunction
with the Web Service Description Language (WSDL), the basis for the W3C
Web Services Description Working Group; it can, also, work with another
service definition language that exhibits the same characteristics as
WSDL. </p>

<p> WSCI describes the observable behavior of a Web Service. This is
expressed in terms of temporal and logical dependencies among the
exchanged messages, featuring sequencing rules, correlation, exception
handling, and transactions. WSCI also describes the collective message
exchange among interacting Web Services, thus providing a global,
message-oriented view of the interactions. </p>

<p> WSCI does not address the definition and the implementation of the
internal processes that actually drive the message exchange. Rather, the
goal of WSCI is to describe the observable behavior of a Web Service by
means of a message-flow oriented interface. This description enables
developers, architects and tools to describe and compose a global view
of the dynamic of the message exchange by understanding the interactions
with the web service. </p>

The W3C Web Services Architecture Working Group
has published the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-wsa-reqs-20020819">second public working draft of
 Web Services Architecture Requirements</a>.
 According to the abstract,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The use of Web services on the World Wide Web is expanding rapidly as the need for application-to-application communication and interoperability grows. These services provide a standard means of communication among different software applications involved in presenting dynamic context-driven information to the user. In order to promote interoperability and extensibility among these applications, as well as to allow them to be combined in order to perform more complex operations, a standard reference architecture is needed. The Web Services Architecture Working Group at W3C is tasked with producing this reference architecture.
</p>

<p>
This document describes a set of requirements for a standard reference architecture for Web services developed by the Web Services Architecture Working Group. These requirements are intended to guide the development of the reference architecture and provide a set of measurable constraints on Web services implementations by which conformance can be determined.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
My favorite part of this document is that it actually defines what the heck a web service is:
</p>

<blockquote>
Definition: A Web service is a software application identified by a URI, whose interfaces and bindings are capable of being defined, described, and discovered as XML artifacts. A Web service supports direct interactions with other software agents using XML based messages exchanged via internet-based protocols.
</blockquote>

<p>
In the past, I've noticed that how a web service is defined often depends on what a vendor is trying to sell me.
Notably absent from this definition is any requirement to use HTTP.

<p> This release of XSLT 2.0 adds an <code>xsl:analyze-string</code>
instruction that can  process unmarked-up text by matching it against a
regular expression. There's also a new
<code>unparsed-entity-public-id()</code> function and a schema for XSLT
2.0 stylesheets. </p>

<p> This version of the XPath 2.0 specification adds more details about
error handling and conformance. It explicitly specifies  the precedence
of operators is explicitly represented. It introduces new
<code>unordered</code> and <code>idiv</code> operators and removes the
<code>assert</code>, <code>precedes</code>, <code>follows</code>, and
<code>=></code> operators. "Every built-in type now has a constructor
function with the same name as the type," and it "is now possible to
cast to a derived atomic type from xs:string or from any supertype of
the derived type (facets are checked during casting)." </p>

<p> The XQuery draft changes everything the XPath 2.0 draft changes, and
also introduces xmlspace and default collation declarations into the
Query Prolog. The use cases draft seems to have removed the reference
and functions use cases, but has added a number of use cases for
strongly typed data. (Typing and the need for typed queries has been one
of the biggest controversies in the XSLT 2/XPath 2/XQuery development).

I've begin the process of moving my <a

href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/xincluder/">SourceForge</a>. This
should enable me to make somewhat more frequent releases, and create
some mailing lists for the project and perhaps XInclude in general. I've
chosen the LGPL as the license. The current CVS tree includes one
significant bug fix in SAXXIncluder since 1.0d9.
</p>

<p> I'm still trying to decode the intricacies of SourceForge and CVS,
and there are probably still a few bugs in the system. Two quick
questions: </p>

<ol>
	<li>Is there any way to delete a directory from the current tree?</li>
	<li>Is there any way to permanently delete a file from CVS? i.e. not
	just from the current tree, but from the history as well? My initial
	check-in added some Unix housekeeping files like .nautilus-xml, that
	really don't belong there.  </li>

The W3C Cascading Style Sheets Working Group has published a working
draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-CSS21-20020802">Cascading
Style Sheets, level 2 revision 1</a>, that is, CSS 2.1. Unusually for a
new spec, this goes backwards from the previous version. It focuses on
removing properties from CSS2 rather than adding them. The impetus for
removal is the failure of browser vendors to implement them. Features
removed include:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Named counters</li>
	<li>font-stretch</li>
	<li>font-size-adjust</li>
	<li>Aural style sheets</li>
	<li>text-shadow</li>
</ul>

<p>
In addition, CSS 2.1 adds  support for media-specific style sheets,
content positioning, table layout, internationalization and some
properties related to user interface. It also "corrects a few errors in
CSS2 (the most important being a new definition of the height/width of
absolutely positioned elements, more influence for HTML's 'style'
attribute and a new calculation of the "clip" property)."

<p>
According to the abstract, this working draft contains: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements to style user interface states and element fragments respectively. </li>
	<li>Additions to the user interface features in CSS2. </li>
	<li>The ability to style the appearance of various standard form elements in HTML4 and properties to augment or replace some remaining stylistic attributes in HTML4. </li>

Wolfgang Meier of the
 Darmstadt University of Technology
 has posted 
version 0.8 of 
 <a href="http://exist-db.org">eXist</a>, an open source  native XML database 
that supports
 fulltext search. 
 XML can be stored in either the
internal, native XML-DB or an external relational database. 
The search engine has
been designed to provide fast XPath queries, using indexes for all
element, text and attribute nodes.  The server is accessible
through HTTP and XML-RPC interfaces and supports the
XML:DB API for Java programming.
Version 0.8 enables the 
database engine to run either as a 
stand-alone server process, embedded into an application, or inside a servlet 
context. The XML:DB API implementation now "supports embedded as well as remote 
access to the database. Additional changes include a new SOAP interface, 
WebDAV integration (using Xincon), performance improvements, and many 
bugfixes."

The W3C HTML Working Group has posted the first public working draft of XFrames, 
an XML application for composing documents together in a single view
(but not merging the infosets). The goal is to replace the already deprecated 
HTML frames. The spec defines seven elements:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><code>frames</code></li>
	<li><code>head</code></li>
	<li><code>title</code></li>
	<li><code>style</code></li>
	<li><code>row</code></li>
	<li><code>column</code></li>
	<li><code>frame</code></li>
</ul>

<p>
For example, consider this document:
</p>



<pre><code>&lt;row>
    &lt;column>
        &lt;frame/>
        &lt;frame/>
    &lt;/column>
    &lt;frame/>
&lt;/row>
</code></pre>

<p>
It produces a layout like this:
</p>

<pre> -------
|   |   |
|---|   |
|   |   |
 -------</pre>

<p>
The exact size of each frame is determined by CSS. 
</p>

<p>
 I've scrupulously avoided frames in my own work, so it's not obvious to me how this proposal differs from what we have now.
In particular, I don't see how this fixes any of the existing problems with 
back buttons, bookmarks, search engines, or browsers with 
too little space for all the frames.

The MindElectric has released <a href="http://www.themindelectric.com/exml/index.html">ElectricXML 5.0</a>, a closed source, free-beer, tree-based API for processing XML with Java. 
This release does allow developers to prevent the parser from throwing away  white space. However, the default behavior is still backwards.
And there are many other areas in which ElectricXML simply does not correctly model XML.
</p>

<p> The most recent example I noticed was that ElectricXML treats the XML declaration as a processing instruction. I admit that a lot of developers think the 
XML declaration is a processing instruction. I've made that mistake myself in the past. However, the XML specification is quite clear that XML declaration is not a processing instruction, and an API shouldn't pretend that it is. 
</p>

<p>
Here's another problem I just discovered. According to the JavaDoc for the <code>Document</code> class, "When parsing XML, you can supply an optional Hashtable of namespace values that acts as global context." Why would you want to do that? All namespaces used should be declared in the document itself, and if they aren't, that's an error that should be reported to the client application. The more time I spend looking at this API, the more flaws I find. I just don't think ElectricXML is suitable for real work.

The W3C DOM Working Group has published two new working drafts:

<li><p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-DOM-Level-3-Val-20020725">Document Object Model (DOM) 
Level 3 Validation Specification</a>
defines interfaces that enable a program to test nodes for validity
against the document's schema. It is a vastly cutback subset of what was
previously done as part of abstract schemas. The working group also 
released a <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/NOTE-DOM-Level-3-AS-20020725">note on
Abstract Schemas</a>, solely to make it clear that work on this spec has
stopped, and will not be pursued further at the current time. This is a
good thing. The abstract schemas API that was being developed was far
too complex and far too tied to the W3C XML Schema Language. Killing
this now opens up the way for many different developers to experiment
with different schema APIs. maybe in a few years we'll have enough
experience with these to standardize one, but right now the community
just does not know enough to do this well.
</p>
</li>


<li><p>The  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-DOM-Level-3-LS-20020725">Document Object Model (DOM) 
Level 3 Load and Save Specification</a> describes how new DOM <code>Document</code> objects can be created,
 how XML text files can be parsed into DOM <code>Document</code> objects, and how
DOM <code>Document</code> objects can be serialized back into text files. There are lots of small changes in this draft. I'll be updating the DOM chapters of

The W3C/IETF joint XML Signature Working Group has released the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/CR-xmldsig-filter2-20020718/">candidate
recommendation of XML-Signature XPath Filter 2.0</a>. According to the
abstract, "XML Signature [XML-DSig] recommends a standard means for
specifying information content to be digitally signed and for
representing the resulting digital signatures in XML. Some applications
require the ability to specify a subset of a given XML document as the
information content to be signed. The XML Signature specification meets
this requirement with the XPath transform. However, this transform can
be difficult to implement efficiently with existing technologies. This
specification defines a new XML Signature transform to facilitate the
development of efficient document subsetting implementations that
interoperate under similar performance profiles."

FileMaker Inc. has released version 6.0 of their namesake <a
href="http://www.filemaker.com/products/fm_home.html">FileMaker<
/a> database for Mac and Windows. The big new feature in this
release is XML import and export across the product line. In
essence, you can import data from any XML document by writing an
XSLT stylesheet that maps that document into FileMaker's
FMPXMLRESULT vocabulary. Going the other direction, you can
export query results to any XML format, again by writing an XSLT
stylesheet that does the conversion.I've been doing XML and HTML
exports from Filemaker with FileMaker scripts, calculation
fields, and AppleScript for years, but this strikes me as much
cleaner and easier. The base version of FileMaker is $299
payware. Upgrades are $149. Server versions range up to $999 for

    Designed for performance and scalability around pipelined SAX
    processing, Cocoon offers a flexible environment based on the
    separation of concerns between content, logic and style.
    A centralized configuration system and sophisticated caching
    top this all off and help you to create, deploy and maintain

    </p>
    <ul>

<li>The build system automatically detects the 
   version of Java in use  and builds a target for this version.</li>
<li> Proper escaping of national characters included in element's attributes
   in XSP page.</li>
 <li> The
   SQLTransformer now tries to open
   a connection to the database several times before
returning
   an error.</li>
<li>CocoonServlet no longer builds its own classloader by default.</li>
<li>Added a "handle-exceptions" init argument in web.xml, used by
   CocoonServlet for the exceptions that the core Cocoon class throws.</li>
   <li> Parameterizable URLFactories.</li>
<li>Novell port</li>

<li>Input modules for Date, Digest, ConstantString, Random,
NullInput, and 
   Collection </li>
<li>A new enumerated values constraint for

</p>
<blockquote>

<p> HTML4 and CSS2 currently support media-dependent style sheets
tailored for different media types. For example, a document may use
sans-serif fonts when displayed on a screen and serif fonts when
printed. "Screen" and "print" are two of media types that have been
defined. Media Queries extend the functionality of media types by
allowing more precise labeling of style sheets. </p>

<p> A Media Query consists of a media type and one or more expressions
to limit the scope of style sheets. Among the media features that can be
used in media queries are "width", "height", and "color". By using Media
Queries, presentations can be tailored to a specific range of output
devices without changing the content itself. </p>

Almost two years ago at XMLOne in San Jose, I publicly <a
href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/slides/xmlone2000/advancedxml/319.html
">predicted</a> that schema repositories were going to fail. Now I get
to say, "I told you so." Microsoft's <a
href="http://www.biztalk.org/home/default.asp">BizTalk</a> is closing
its doors one week from today. Several of the other sites I targeted for
failure are still going, but only XML.org seems to be functioning as a
real schema repository any more, and it's no longer emphasizing that
task. I'm still predicting that UDDI will be a massive failure that
never achieves any significant adoption. Most of the rest of my
predictions still seem on-target, though I was a little early at picking
2001 as the year for SVG. 2002 is just starting to see large SVG use.
2003 seems to be the year where it will become more ubiquitous.

The W3C DOM Working Group has announced that they've halted work on DOM
Abstract Schemas. This strikes me as sensible. The whole abstract
schemas model they'd created was extremely unwieldy, didn't really fully
handle either DTDs or schemas, and was completely unable to handle
alternative languages like RELAX NG and Schematron. This is a good
example of a process that really did need to be scrapped and started
over from scratch, if at all, and I'm glad the DOM working group had the
courage to admit their problems. This opens up the field for other
researchers to try a variety of approaches to schema APIs. The "Document
Editing" part of Abstract Schema  will be spun off as a new "Validation"
module, so it will still be possible to do programmatic validation as
part of DOM. It just won't be possible to model the schemas directly.

I've posted version 1.0d9 of my <a href="XInclude/">XInclude processor
for Java</a>. This version still supports DOM, JDOM, and SAX. The JDOM
support has been upgraded to the current CVS version of JDOM. It may
work with JDOM beta 8. It probably won't work with earlier versions. The
DOM version works again with Xerces 2.0.2. Earlier versions of Xerces
mostly have nasty bugs that prevent it from working. I haven't done any
extensive testing with other DOM implementations. For my own use, I
mostly stick to the SAX version, which actually works quite well
provided you don't need XPointer support.

There's one breaking API change. I renamed the package from
<code>com.macfaq.xml</code> to <code>com.elharo.xml.xinclude</code>. (I
plan to release some other things in the <code>com.elharo.xml</code>
package in September.) I've also cleaned up the distribution quite a bit
in this release. Some necessary JAR files are now bundled, and I've
added a build file for Ant. Various bugs were fixed. The
<code>xi:fallback</code> element is not supported yet. That's on my TODO
list. I also plan to revise the inner workings of the DOMXIncluder class
pretty radically based on techniques I learned while working on the DOM
chapters of <a href="books/xmljava/"><cite>Processing XML with
Java</cite></a>.

I've updated <a href="books/bible2/chapters/ch18.html">XSL Formatting Objects, Chapter 18 of the XML Bible</a>, to be fully conformant with the final recommendation of XSL-FO 1.0.
Mostly the changes were fairly minor, just changing the <code>master-name</code> attribute to the <code>master-reference</code> attribute on about four elements. 
I also updated the FOP coverage to version 0.20.4, and fixed a few minor errors where I noticed them.

<p>
For this release, I pulled my original Word file into OpenOffice where I edited it and then saved it to HTML. The conversion from Word to OpenOffice was straightforward. The conversion from OpenOffice to HTML was not.
Although OpenOffice's HTML is a lot cleaner than Word's, it still has a
number of flaws. Most importantly, it does not properly handle lists or
preformatted sections. It tries to represent them using CSS and
<code>FONT</code> tags rather than basic <code>UL</code> and
<code>PRE</code> elements. In general, there were lots of unnecessary
CSS attributes and style tags. For instance, virtually every paragraph
had its font color set to black. Many paragraphs had a <code>lang</code>
attribute identifying the language as the empty string. I had to do a
lot of manual cleanup to make the final result look good. This would
have been easier if I could have used XSLT, but OpenOffice saves HTML
3.2, not XHTML or even well-formed HTML.
</p>

<p>
Still, this was no worse than doing the task in Word, which has similar
issues. The one area where Word was notably superior to OpenOffice for
this job was a very specific one involving search and replace.
OpenOffice does not let you replace font qualities like "Bold" or "Times
New Roman" with styles like "emphasis" or "BodyText". You can replace
styles with styles and fonts with fonts, but not fonts with styles.

the XML-Signature XPath Filter 2.0</a>. 
According to the abstract,
"XML Signature [XML-DSig] recommends a standard means for specifying information content to be digitally signed and for representing the resulting digital signatures in XML. Some applications require the ability to specify a subset of a given XML document as the information content to be signed. The XML Signature specification meets this requirement with the XPath transform. However, this transform can be difficult to implement efficiently with existing technologies. This specification defines a new XML Signature transform to facilitate the development of efficient document subsetting technologies that interoperate under similar performance profiles."
According to the Intro, "The goal is to (1) more easily specify XPath transforms and (2) more efficiently process those transforms." Comments are due by July 11.

<img src="books/xian2/xian2medium.jpg" 
width="127" height="190" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left" alt="Cover of XML in a Nutshell, 2nd edition"
/>
<p>
I'm pleased to announce that the <a
href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/xmlnut2/">second edition of
<cite>XML in a Nutshell</cite></a> has been released and can now be
found at fine computer bookstores everywhere including <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN%3D0596002920/ref=nosim/
cafeaulaitA/">Amazon.com</a>. Powells, Buy.com, and Barnes &amp; Noble
show it on back order, but presumably they'll get stocks soon. Amazon
almost always sells out of their initial runs of my books within the
first few hours of me announcing it here, but they generally get stock
back in very quickly. The list price is $39.95, but Amazon has its usual
30% discount.
</p>

<p>
For those of you who've read and enjoyed the first edition, the obvious
question is what's new? and is it worth shelling out another $30 to
update? The latter question may depend on your pocketbook and just how
dog-eared your copy of the first edition is, but I can tell you what's
new.
</p>

<p>
The single biggest addition since the first edition is complete coverage
of  W3C XML Schemas. Scott wrote a tutorial chapter and I wrote a
reference chapter that together cover every last element and attribute
in the language. Jeni Tennison did an excellent tech review of those
chapters, and taught us many things about the schema spec that were far
from obvious. I think the result   is the most complete and accurate
reference to the W3C XML Schema Language you'll find anywhere. I also
wrote a new chapter about RDDL, the Resource Directory Description
Language, an XML application based on modular XHTML that can be used for
XML documents placed at the end of namespace URIs.
</p>

<p>
The remainder of the book is very similar to the first edition in
overall structure and layout. However, we did rewrite every chapter to
bring it up to date with the state of the art of XML in 2002. In the
process, we added a lot of new and updated content to the existing
chapters including:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>SAX filters</li>
	<li>JAXP, the Java API for XML Processing</li>
	<li>TrAX, the Transformations API for XML</li>
	<li>Unicode 3.1</li>
	<li>XLink 1.0</li>
	<li>XPointer, 2nd candidate recommendation</li>
	<li>XSL Formatting Objects 1.0</li>
</ul>

<p>
Of course, we also corrected any mistakes we found along the way, or
that had been pointed out to us by readers of the first edition. This
includes the infamous bug on p. 35 that replaced ?, *, and + with *, *,
and *. (FYI, I have no idea how that slipped in originally. Scott went
through the drafts of the first edition and verified that it was correct
right up through the final page proofs. Somewhere between the page
proofs and the printer, the ? and + got changed asterisks.)  Overall,
though, I think the first edition was a pretty good book and this one's
even better. If you're working with schemas, then I think you'll want a
copy of the second edition immediately. If not, you may be able to hold
out until the pages start falling out of the first edition (which may
take awhile, O'Reilly uses pretty durable binding.) The second edition
of <cite>XML in a Nutshell</cite> is $39.95 and is now or soon will be
available at bookstores everywhere.

Over the last couple of weeks I've done the initial author review and made a number of changes to 
<a href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xmljava/">Processing XML with Java</a>. All the chapters have been rewritten. Some of the most significant changes include:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>I moved the SOAP schemas out of <a href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xmljava/chapters/ch02.html">Chapter 2, <cite>XML Protocols</cite></a> into 
<a href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xmljava/chapters/apa.html">Appendix B</a>. I also updated them to the official schemas for SOAP 1.1.</p></li>
	<li><p>  In <a href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xmljava/chapters/ch04.html">Chapter 4, <cite>Converting XML</cite></a>, I added some material on the necessity of streaming solutions for large documents. 
I added some diagrams and text designed to clarify exactly how the conversion example operates. 
I also updated the XQuery examples to the latest working draft.</p>
</li>
	<li><p> <a href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xmljava/chapters/ch05.html">Chapter 5, <cite>Reading XML</cite></a>, probably changed the most.
I reorganized this chapter significantly with much earlier, high-level discussion of the various APIs.
I added the new XMLPULL API, corrected some bugs in the SAX example,
and updated the ElectricXML section to ElectricXML 4.0.</p></li>
	<li><p>I added a sidebar on <cite>Measuring DOM Size</cite> to  <a href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xmljava/chapters/ch09.html">Chapter 9, <cite>DOM</cite></a>. I'm still trying to improve these numbers to the point where they're reproducible and I actually believe them, though.</p></li>
	<li><p>I updated <a href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xmljava/chapters/ch05.html">Chapter 13, <cite>DOM Output</cite></a>, to cover the latest working draft of DOM 3 Load and Save.</p></li>
	<li><p>I added a new section on Java integration to <a href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xmljava/chapters/ch14.html">Chapter 14, <cite>JDOM</cite></a>, since this is one of the major benefits of JDOM.</p></li>
	<li><p>In <a href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xmljava/chapters/ch16.html">Chapter 16, <cite>XPath</cite></a>, I updated the Jaxen section
to the final, release version of that API.</p></li>
	<li><p>I combined the JDOM and JAXP quick reference appendixes into one larger <a href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xmljava/chapters/apa.html">XML APIs appendix</a>. I also added XMLPULL to that appendix. </p></li>
</ul>

In addition, there were many minor edits, corrections, and clarifications throughout. Thanks are due to everyone who sent in comments and suggestions, especially the technical reviewers
Mike Champion, Robert W. Husted, Anne T. Manes, Ron Weber, and

Rogue Wave's posted an early access release of 
<a href="http://www.roguewave.com/developer/tac/ratchet">Ratchet</a>, "a means to map XML documents into a C++
representation".
Ratchet "generates classes that represent
definitions that comply with the W3C XML Schema Recommendation. The
schema compiler generates source code, makefiles and HTML class reference
documentation for the C++ language.  The generated classes comprise a 
object model that conceptually represents the XML Schema
definitions.  The object model consists of a marshalling framework
that allows serialization of objects to and from XML instances."
Of course, this tool shares the common fallacies of all such tools; that is,
</p>

<ul>
	<li>All documents of interest have schemas. </li>
	<li>All documents of interest that do have schemas are valid according to their schemas.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Neither assumption is true except in very limited circumstances. 
Ratchet will likely be payware when finally released.

<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/PR-xml-exc-c14n-20020524/">Exclusive XML Canonicalization Version 1.0</a>. Quoting from the abstract,
</p>
<blockquote>
Canonical XML [XML-C14N] specifies a standard serialization of XML that, when applied to a subdocument, includes the subdocument's ancestor context including all of the namespace declarations and attributes in the "xml:" namespace. However, some applications require a method which, to the extent practical, excludes ancestor context from a canonicalized subdocument. For example, one might require a digital signature over an XML payload (subdocument) in an XML message that will not break when that subdocument is removed from its original message and/or inserted into a different context. This requirement is satisfied by Exclusive XML Canonicalization.

NekoHTML is a simple HTML scanner and tag balancer that enables 
application programmers to parse HTML documents and access the 
information using standard XML interfaces. The parser can scan 
HTML files and "fix up" many common mistakes that human (and

missing parent elements; automatically closes elements with 
optional end tags; and can handle mismatched inline element tags.

As Murphy's Law requires, the day after I finally got around to upgrading to Mozilla RC2 on my Windows box, the Mozilla Project posted <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla1.0/">Mozilla RC3</a>.
There are no new features in this release, but lots of bugs have been fixed. 
This has been my default browser on Windows for almost a year now, 
but the Macintosh version still has at least one <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=138768">show stopping bug in AppleScript</a> that keeps me from using it regularly. 
</p>

<p>
Also, Hans-Joachim Matheus wrote in to report that the Netscape 7 prerelease I mentioned yesterday appears to be based on Mozilla 1.0RC2.
He cites <a href="http://www.netscape.de/netscapeprodukte/netscapebrowser/netscape7/">this article from Netscape Germany</a>.
</p>

<p>
In other browser news, <a href="http://galeon.sourceforge.net/">Galeon 1.2.2</a> for Linux/Gnome has been released. 
Galeon is a stripped down web browser based on mozilla's Gecko rendering engine.
Unlike Mozilla, this is a browser only, not an e-mail client/IRC tool/newsgroup reader/food processor. I've used it a little on my new Linux box, and have been
favorably impressed. 
1.2.2 is based on Mozilla 1.0RC2.

Ed Avis's <a href="http://membled.com/work/apps/xmltv/">XMLTV 0.5</a> 
 is a set of programs to process television listings 
 	into  an XML-based format. There are backends to download TV
	 listings for Canada, the USA, Britain, Austria, and Germany. It
	 also includes some filter tools to sort, grep, print, and munge
	 listings, and two end-user programs to plan a week's TV viewing.

Ron Bourette's posted the third alpha of  <a href="http://www.rpbourret.com/xmldbms/index.htm">XML-DBMS  2.0</a>, 
a set of Java packages for transferring data between an XML
document and a relational database using an object-relational mapping.
It includes a flexible, XML-based mapping language for describing the
mappings.
New features in version 2.0 include heterogenous joins, a filter
language, updates and deletes (including insert-or-update semantics),
support for database-generated keys, connection and statement pooling,
custom formatting, and limited transformations in the mapping language.
The major new functionality alpha 3 is a map generation tool
that can start with an XML-DBMS map, a DTD, or a database schema and
generate an XML-DBMS map, a DTD, or a set of CREATE TABLE statements.

Netscape's posted the <a href="http://channels.netscape.com/ns/browsers/7/download.jsp">first preview release of
 Netscape 7.0</a> for <a href="ftp://ftp.netscape.com/pub/netscape7/english/7.0_PR1/windows/">Windows</a>, <a href="ftp://ftp.netscape.com/pub/netscape7/english/7.0_PR1/mac/">Mac</a>, and <a href="ftp://ftp.netscape.com/pub/netscape7/english/7.0_PR1/unix/linux22/">Linux</a>.
 Netscape 7.0 supports direct display of 
 XML in the browser with either CSS or XSLT stylesheets.
 The major new features for this release 
 (at least from an XML perspective) are P3P and 
  MathML presentation markup support.
  For MathML, you'll need to download some extra fonts. 
  This is based on the Mozilla code base, though I haven't yet figured out which release.

Andy Clark's updated his
 <a href="http://www.apache.org/~andyc/">NekoHTML</a>
 open source HTML
  parser to version 0.6.1.
According to Clark, 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
NekoHTML is a simple HTML scanner and tag balancer that enables 
application programmers to parse HTML documents and access the 
information using standard XML interfaces. The parser can scan 
HTML files and "fix up" many common mistakes that human (and 
computer) authors make in writing HTML documents. NekoHTML adds 
missing parent elements; automatically closes elements with 
optional end tags; and can handle mismatched inline element tags. 
</p>

<p>
NekoHTML is written using the Xerces Native Interface (XNI) that 
is the foundation of the Xerces2 implementation. This enables you 
to use the NekoHTML parser with existing XNI tools without 
modification or rewriting code. 
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
The major new feature in this release is that content after the closing
<code>&lt;/html&gt;</code> tag is ignored.

I thought today I'd post a short fable that I wrote for  the <a
href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xmljava/chapters/pr01.html">
Preface</a> of <cite><a
href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xmljava/">Processing XML with
Java</a></cite>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>  One night five developers, all of whom wore very thick glasses
   and had recently been hired by Elephants Inc.,
   the world&#8217;s largest online purveyor of elephants and elephant supplies, 
   were familiarizing themselves with the 
   company&#8217;s order processing system
   when they stumbled into a directory full of
   XML documents on the main server.
&#8220;What&#8217;s this?&#8221;, the team leader asked excitedly.
None of them had ever heard 
 of XML before so they decided to split up the files between
 them, and try to figure out just what this strange and wondrous
 new technology actually was. 
</p><p>
The first developer, who specialized in 
optimizing Oracle databases,
 printed out  a stack of FMPXMLRESULT documents generated by the 
 FileMaker database where all the orders were stored,
and began poring over them.
"So this is XML! Why, it&#8217;s nothing novel.
As anyone can see who&#8217;s able, an XML document is nothing but a
table!"
</p><p>
&#8220;What do you mean, a table?&#8221; replied the second programmer, 
well versed in object oriented theory and occupied with 
 a collection of  XMI documents representing
UML diagrams for the system. 
&#8220;Even a Visual Basic programmer could see that
XML documents aren&#8217;t tables. 
Tables can&#8217;t contain duplicates! 
These are more like objects and classes. 
Indeed, that&#8217;s it exactly.
 An XML document is an object and a DTD is a class.&#8221;
</p><p>
&#8220;Objects? A strange kind of object, indeed!&#8221; 
said the third developer,
a web designer of some renown, who had loaded the XHTML user documentation for 
the order processing system into Mozilla.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t see any types at all. If you think this is an object,
I don&#8217;t want to install your software. 
But with all those stylesheets there, it should be clear to anyone not sedated,
that  XML is just HTML updated!&#8221;
</p><p>
&#8220;HTML? You must be joking&#8221; said the fourth, a computer
science professor on sabbatical from MIT, who was engrossed in an XSLT
stylesheet that validated all the other documents against a Schematron schema. 
&#8220;Look at the clean nesting of hierarchical structures, each tag
matching its partner as it should. I&#8217;ve never seen HTML that looks
this good. Clearly what we have here is S-expressions which 
is certainly nothing new. Babbage invented this back in 1882!&#8221; 
</p><p>
&#8220;S expressions?&#8221; queried
 the technical writer, who was occupied
with  technical documentation for the project written in 
DocBook. 
&#8220;I&#8217;ve never heard of such a thing. 
To me, this looks just like a FrameMaker MIF file, 
though finding the GUI does seem
to be taking me awhile.&#8221;
</p><p>
  And so they argued into the night, none of them willing to give
  an inch, all of them presenting still more examples to prove
  their points, none of them bothering to look at the others&#8217;
  examples. 
</p>

X), HP-UX, AIX, and Solaris. This release combines the features of the
previously separate FrameMaker and FrameMaker+SGML at the lower price of
the two. New features include:
</p>

<ul>
<li>	Ability to import, validate, and export XML files and DTDs for "XML roundtripping"</li>
	<li>XML namespace support</li>
	<li>Unicode support for XML </li>
	<li>Automatic generation of CSS stylesheets for XML files </li>
	<li>DocBook 4.1, DocBook 4.1.2, and XHTML sample applications included for structured authoring </li>
	<li> eXtensible Metadata Platform (XMP) support</li>
	<li>WebDAV  support </li>
	
	<li>Tagged PDF generation for better document accessibility and logical reflow of documents </li>
	<li>Windows 2000 accessibility compatibility "including an available high-contrast user interface and an extensive set of keyboard shortcuts" </li>
	<li>Alternate text descriptions for graphics </li>
	<li>Automatic association of master pages to pages based on paragraph styles or element tags </li>
	<li>More flexibility in custom master pages for reordering in any sequence </li>
	<li>Up to 12 available running header and footer variables for more complex documents </li>
	<li>Select/Deselect All option in the Import Formats dialog box for simpler importing </li>

	<li>Improved UNIX font support including  TrueType, Opentype, and Type 1 formats </li>
	<li>Import filters for RTF 1.6 and the "latest versions of Microsoft Office files" </li>
	<li>Automatic creation of HTML versions of documents through the included Quadralay WebWorks Publisher Standard Edition 7.0 software, plus templates for publishing to the HTML 3.2, XML, Microsoft Reader, and Palm Reader formats </li>
	<li>SVG support on MacOS, Windows and Solaris </li>

</ul>

<p>
I'd love to hear from anyone who knows from experience whether this release can manage large DocBook documents (or for that matter if anyone from Adobe is reading this and feels like tossing me an eval copy, I'll check it out for myself and report the results here.)

I'm pleased to announce that I've posted the <a
href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xmljava/chapters/apb.html">JDOM
Quick Reference</a>, Appendix B of <cite><a
href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xmljava/">Processing XML with
Java</a></cite> here on Cafe con Leche. This appendix contains complete
signatures and summaries for all the public classes and interfaces in
JDOM. Indeed in a few cases these are more complete than what's in the
JDOM JavaDoc.
</p>

<p>
As usual, I'd much appreciate hearing any comments, criticisms, or
corrections you have for this appendix. I'm particularly interested in
three issues:</p>


<ol>

<li><p> Should this appendix be combined with Appendix A, JAXP Quick Reference? My original plan separated SAX, DOM, JDOM, TrAX, and JAXP factories into separate appendixes which I suppose is also still an option) but I eventually decided to pull the JAXP APIs into one chapter. That leaves JDOM hanging a bit since it's not a component of JAXP. I could just make one bigger appendix that covered them all, which would have the benefit of more parallel structure in the heading levels, and putting the JDOM QuickRef onto a single page for the online version.</p>
</li>

<li><p>Have I accidentally included any deprecated methods? I tried to get them all out, but I may have missed one or two.
</p></li>

<li><p>Have I forgotten any important exceptions any of the methods might throw? The checked exceptions should all be there, but a lot of them are runtime exceptions and I could have missed these. In a few cases, it's a judgement call. For instance, should the <code>JDOMFactory</code> interface methods declare the same exceptions as the  <code>DefaultJDOMFactory</code> class does. (In this case, I deliberately decided not to include them because that's an implementation detail.) This one's particularly important because I plan to go through the Javadoc for the JDOM classes and patch up the <code>@throws</code> clauses based on what I discovered here, so this can have an impact beyond just this book.</p></li>

</ol>

<p>
Please take a look and let me know what you think. I'm almost done and time is getting short, so if they're any other thoughts on any parts of the book you've been procrastinating about, now is the time to send them.  Your comments have been extremely helpful up till now, and are always much appreciated. Thanks!

<a href="http://www.limewire.com">Limewire 2.4.3</a>, the open source Gnutella client has been released, which wouldn't normally qualify as news for Cafe con Leche, except that it has a really annoying incompatibility with Xerces 2.0.1

Either Limewire's DOM code that depends on the Xerces implementation classes directly or it's serializing a DOM using Java object serialization instead of plain vanilla XML. Either way the bug would tie it to a specific version of Xerces. Or it could be something more subtle, like writing code that depends on bugs in particular versions of Xerces. I'm not sure, but I really do wish somebody would fix this! For the moment, I'm stuck using <a href="http://www.audiogalaxy.com/">AudioGalaxy</a> which has a much broader selection of files, but a truly abysmal user interface.

Andy Clark's updated his
 <a href="http://www.apache.org/~andyc/">NekoHTML</a>
 open source HTML
  parser to version 0.6
According to Clark, 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
NekoHTML is a simple HTML scanner and tag balancer that enables 
application programmers to parse HTML documents and access the 
information using standard XML interfaces. The parser can scan 
HTML files and "fix up" many common mistakes that human (and 
computer) authors make in writing HTML documents. NekoHTML adds 
missing parent elements; automatically closes elements with 
optional end tags; and can handle mismatched inline element tags. 
</p>

<p>
NekoHTML is written using the Xerces Native Interface (XNI) that 
is the foundation of the Xerces2 implementation. This enables you 
to use the NekoHTML parser with existing XNI tools without 
modification or rewriting code. 
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
Changes in this release include

</p>

<ul>
	<li> Custom document filters can be  appended to the default NekoHTML parser pipeline </li>
	<li>  Filters for serializing HTML documents and removing elements from the document event stream </li>
	<li> Experimental functionality to allow applications to dynamically insert content into the HTML document   stream; </li>
	<li>  A minimal Xerces2 Jar file containing just the   files required for using the HTMLConfiguration class  directly to alleviate full dependence on Xerces2 distribution; </li>
	<li>  Bug fixes </li>

I am very pleased to announce that I have posted 
<cite><a href="books/xmljava/chapters/ch15.html">The JDOM Model</a></cite>, Chapter 15 of <cite><a href="books/xmljava">Processing XML with Java</a></cite>
and most importantly the last chapter in the book. There's still a preface and a couple of appendixes to be written, but at this point the main body of the book is complete. This is now a complete introduction to writing Java programs that read, manipulate, search, query, and output XML documents. 
I think this book is more up-to-date and more complete on these matters than any other book on the market. 
It covers DOM, SAX, JDOM, TrAX, JAXP, and a lot more. 
The actual paper version should be out in a couple of months
</p>

<p>
The latest chapter focuses on the core node classes in the <code>org.jdom</code> package: <code>Element</code>, <code>Attribute</code>, <code>Text</code>, etc. 
It discusses the methods of each one in detail and shows you how to use it.
It introduces filters and many other techniques for navigation.
And as with all the chapters, it points out the rough spots where JDOM can burn you if you aren't careful. This chapter's far and away the most up-to-date coverage of the very latest JDOM version you can get anywhere. It is essential reading for anyone who's using or considering using JDOM.

<p>
I opened up my e-mail last night to find a huge number of messages from various automated anti-virus scanners complaining about an <a href="http://swjscmail1.java.sun.com/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0205&amp;L=xml-interest&amp;F=&amp;S=&amp;P=646">infected message</a> I allegedly sent to the xml-interest mailing list, which was a bit of a surprise since I generally practice safe computing (that is, I avoid Outlook like the plague, which is, now that I think about it, a very appropriate cliche.)
</p>

<p>
On further investigation, I tend to doubt that I actually sent the message. Instead it seems to be the result of the <a href="http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/w32.klez.e@mm.html">W32.Klez worm</a> infecting the system of somebody who is careless enough to have Outlook installed on their system. Apparently, this worm randomly chooses a From address from the e-mail addresses it finds on the local system and uses that, rather than using the infected  host's actual address. On this occasion, it happened to choose me. 
I suspect inspection of the actual headers of the original message would reveal the true culprit. 
</p>

<p>
To compound matters, the worm sent the message to a mailing-list that doesn't require subscription in order to post so the message got forwarded to 2,125 subscribers, some of whom were running filters that blocked the message (good) and automatically notified me about the virus-laden e-mail I didn't actually send them (bad). 
</p>

<p>
What can be done to stop this in the future? I can think of a few things:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Mailing lists should disallow posts with attachments. They should most especially disallow posts with attachments from non-subscribers.</li>
	<li>Antivirus filters should stop assuming that they know who actually sent the message to them, at least without much more sophisticated heuristics to figure out whether or not the From address is forged. </li>
   <li>Individuals should stop using Outlook. There's really no excuse for this. In 2002, running Outlook is like smoking a big stinky cigar in a crowded subway car full of asthmatics. It pollutes the environment and is actively hostile to your fellow human beings. If you still have Outlook on your system, delete it. Delete it now. And while you're at it, it wouldn't hurt to get rid of Word, 
   Office, Windows, and any other Microsoft software within reach.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Here are a few e-mail programs that are better than Microsoft Outlook:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.eudora.com">Eudora</a> (my personal choice), Mac and Windows</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a>, multiple platforms</li>

Once again I'm chairing the XML track at Software Development 2002 East
in Boston this November 18-22. The <a
href="http://www.cmpevents.com/SDxE/default.asp?option=14&amp;V=1&amp;CPid=16">call
for papers</a> is now live. Tracks include .NET Programming, C++, Java
Programming, Project Management, Requirements &amp; Analysis, Scripting
Languages, Web Services, Wireless, and XML, though I'm only personally
invoked with the XML track. Session types include 90 minute classes,
full and half-day tutorials, panels, roundtables, brown bag case
studies, birds-of-a-feather gatherings and keynotes. The deadline for
submitting abstracts is this Friday, May 10, 2002.
</p>

<p>
For the XML track, I try to select a broad range of tutorial-focused
sessions that cover specific technologies. For example, Intro to
Schemas, Intro to XSLT, Overview of XML Security, DOM for Java
programmers, etc. The key idea is that the session should be a 90-minute
to full-day introduction and how-to session about some specific XML
technology that's reasonably well-cooked and can be used today. We find
that our audience likes very practical sessions and is not as receptive
to  bleeding edge technologies (e.g. DOM Level 3, XSLT2) and advanced,
research level presentations (e.g. DAML and Quantum Topic Maps,
Optimization Schemes for XSLT, SOAP vs. REST). Our audience tends to be
Java and C++ professionals who are using some XML rather than fulltime
XML hackers. For the XML track, we are especially interested in
90-minute and half-day sessions. If you have any questions, feel free to

The W3C Resource Description Framework (RDF) Core Working Group
has published four new working drafts:
</p>

<dl>
	<dt><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-rdf-schema-20020430/">RDF Vocabulary Description Language 1.0: RDF Schema</a></dt>

<dd>
Quoting from the abstract, "The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a general-purpose language for representing information in the Web. This specification describes how to use RDF to describe RDF vocabularies. This specification also defines a basic vocabulary for this purpose, as well as conventions that can be used by Semantic Web applications to support more sophisticated RDF vocabulary description."
</dd>
	<dt><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-rdf-mt-20020429/">RDF Model Theory</a></dt>
<dd>
The abstract states, "This is a specification of a model-theoretic semantics for RDF and RDFS, and some basic results on entailment. This document was written with the intention of providing a precise semantic theory for RDF and RDFS, and to sharpen the notions of consequence and inference."
</dd>
	<dt><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-rdf-primer-20020426/">RDF Primer</a></dt>
<dd>
According to the abstract, RDF "is particularly intended for representing metadata about Web resources, such as the title, author, and modification date of a Web page, the copyright and syndication information about a Web document, the availability schedule for some shared resource, or the description of a Web user's preferences for information delivery. RDF provides a common framework for expressing this information in such a way that it can be exchanged between applications without loss of meaning. Since it is a common framework, application designers can leverage the availability of common RDF parsers and processing tools. Exchanging information between different applications means that the information may be made available to applications other than those for which it was originally created. This Primer is designed to provide the reader the basic fundamentals required to effectively use RDF in their particular applications."
</dd>
	<dt><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-rdf-testcases-20021112/">RDF Test Cases</a></dt>
<dd>
This document describes a set of machine-processable test cases for RDF
though it does not contain the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/">test cases</a>
themselves which are available separately.

ToXgene is based on a conceptual description of the data to be
generated (the templates). This tool is intended for cases in
which the structure of the data to be generated is known, the
data is required to conform to that structure, and multiple
collections of documents, with varying structures, sizes and
complexities, can easily be generated." This version adds
support for recursive XML content, improved error-reporting, and
seeding of random generators.

The W3C Web Services Architecture Working Group
has published the initial working drafts
of
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-wsa-reqs-20020429">Web Services Architecture Requirements</a>
and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-ws-desc-reqs-20020429">Web Service Description Requirements</a>. One of the more interesting pieces in these drafts is the following definition:
</p>

<blockquote>
 A Web Service is a software application identified by a URI [IETF RFC 2396], whose interfaces and binding are capable of being defined, described and discovered by XML artifacts and supports direct interactions with other software applications using XML based messages via internet-based protocols. 
</blockquote>

<p>
That's useful, given that web services are one of those technologies whose exxact definition seems to change depending on which vendor is trying to sell you what when. 
</p>


<p>
However, this is all very early, and these drafts do not yet reflect a consensus within the working group so this is all still up in the air, and some major pieces are almost certain to change over the next year.

<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/CR-SVG11-20020430/">Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) 1.1 Specification</a> and
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/CR-SVGMobile-20020430/">Mobile SVG Profiles: SVG Tiny and SVG Basic</a>. 
SVG Tiny is a stripped down version of SVG for cell phones.
SVG Basic is a slightly larger version of SVG for PDAs.

The W3C Core Working Group has published another working draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-xml11-20020425/">XML 1.1</a>.
This draft is some improvement relative to the previous draft.
In particular, the C0 control characters like bell, vertical tab, and formfeed 
have been forbidden as they are in XML 1.0.
(That's one bullet dodged.)
 However, this draft still allows many name characters that should be forbidden including 
some very weird characters like &copy;, &plusmn;, <sup>7</sup> (&amp;0x2077;, superscript 7),
 the musical symbol for a six-string fretboard, and the zero-width space. 
 It also allows private-use characters and undefined characters, both of which will produce non-interoperable documents. 
 </p>
 
 <p> 
	Furthermore, XML 1.1 introduces extra line ending characters
	&amp;#x85 and  &amp;#x2028. The former is used on IBM
	mainframes that are stuck in the 1970s. The latter is a
	theoretical character that is not actually used in practice
	today. Both will cause significant problems when XML documents
	are edited in many existing tools, especially text editors like
	emacs.
</p>


<p>
	The second  big change in this draft is a requirement that XML
	1.1 documents be placed in character normalized form. In brief,
	this requires that no names, text sections, attribute values,
	and so forth begin with a combining character such as combining
	accent acute. These characters can still be used. They just
	can't be the first character (which makes sense because they're
	always combined with the character that precedes them).
	Furthermore (and here's the hard one for implementors) you're
	no longer allowed to use character sequences like
	&amp;0x45;&amp;0x0301; (e - combining accent acute) when an
	equivalent combined form exists. Instead you must use the
	precombined form &amp;0xE9. On the other hand, you could use 
	&amp;0x6B;&amp;0x0301; (k - combining accent acute) because
	there's no precombined form for that character.
</p>

<p>
	There's also a probably unintentional interaction between the
	XML 1.1 draft and the Character Model. XML 1.1 requires that
	all documents be in <a
	href="http://www.w3.org/TR/charmod/#sec-include-normalized">
	include normalized form</a>. However, that requires that all
	includes be resolved first, just to do well-formedness
	checking. According to the character model, "An
	<strong>include</strong> is an instance of a syntactic device
	specified in a language to include an <strong>entity</strong>
	at the position of the include, replacing the include itself.
	Examples of includes are entity references in XML, @import
	rules in CSS and the &lt;xsl:include&gt; element in XSLT.
	Character escapes are a special case of includes where the
	included entity is a single character." XIncludes aren't
	mentioned, but they're clearly implied as well. Non-validating
	processors can no longer ignore external entities of whatever
	kind. They must be resolved before well-formedness checking can
	be completed.
</p>

<p>
	The bottom line: despite the small improvements in this working
	draft, XML 1.1 is still a very bad idea at its core. It will
	wreak massive havoc with the installed base of XML processing
	and text editing software in exchange for a very limited
	benefit for a very small number of users. Even if you think the
	benefits outweigh the massive costs, the changes proposed here
	are far from the minimal set required to achieve those
	benefits. This specification should be rejected completely.

The W3C has updated the

<cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-SVG2Reqs-20020422/">SVG
1.1/1.2/2.0 Requirements</a></cite> now lays out a rough

</p>

<ul>
<li>SVG 1.1 is a modularized version of 
SVG 1.0, including errata from SVG 1.0 
and the minimum number of new features required to develop an SVG
profile for mobile devices</li>

<li>SVG 1.2 is an incremental upgrade to  SVG 1.1 
that will add only
the most needed and most 
requested new features to SVG.</li>

<li>SVG 2.0 will  be the next major upgrade that 
adds big new features.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I wish some other working groups, XSLT in particular, 
could take this sort of 
more incremental approach to upgraqdes.

The first release candidate of Mozilla 1.0 has been posted for the usual batch of platforms (Mac, Windows, Linux, et al).
RC1 implements one-button publishing in Mozilla Composer, 
reorganizes the menu bar and context menus for improved usability, implements LDAP over SSL, implements Mail Return receipts, and adds a new Download Manager. 
Mozilla supports XML, XHTML, HTML, CSS, XSLT, MathML, and more. My absolute favorite feature is the ability to turn of pop-up ads. 
This has been my default browser on Windows for almost a year now, but the Macintosh version still has at least one <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=138768">show stopping bug in AppleScript</a> that keeps me from using it regularly.

The W3C has released the final recommendation of the 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/REC-P3P-20020416/">Platform for Privacy Preferences 1.0 specification</a>. According to the introduction:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p> The Platform for Privacy Preferences Project (P3P) enables Web sites
to express their privacy practices in a standard format that can be
retrieved automatically and interpreted easily by user agents. P3P user
agents will allow users to be informed of site practices (in both
machine- and human-readable formats) and to automate decision-making
based on these practices when appropriate. Thus users need not read the
privacy policies at every site they visit. </p>

<p> Although P3P provides a technical mechanism for ensuring that users
can be informed about privacy policies before they release personal
information, it does not provide a technical mechanism for making sure
sites act according to their policies. Products implementing this
specification MAY provide some assistance in that regard, but that is up
to specific implementations and outside the scope of this specification.
However, P3P is complementary to laws and self-regulatory programs that
can provide enforcement mechanisms. In addition, P3P does not include
mechanisms for transferring data or for securing personal data in
transit or storage. P3P may be built into tools designed to facilitate
data transfer. These tools should include appropriate security
safeguards. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>
The W3C P3P Specification Working Group has also published a new working draft of
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-P3P-preferences-20020415">A P3P Preference Exchange Language 1.0 (APPEL1.0)</a>. According to the abstract, "This document complements the P3P1.0 specification [P3P10] by specifying a language for describing collections of preferences regarding P3P policies between P3P agents. Using this language, a user can express her preferences in a set of preference-rules (called a ruleset), which can then be used by her user agent to make automated or semi-automated decisions regarding the acceptability of machine-readable privacy policies from P3P enabled Web sites."

Andy Clark's updated his
 <a href="http://www.apache.org/~andyc/">NekoHTML</a>

  parser. 
According to Clark, 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
NekoHTML is a simple HTML scanner and tag balancer that enables 
application programmers to parse HTML documents and access the 
information using standard XML interfaces. The parser can scan 
HTML files and "fix up" many common mistakes that human (and 
computer) authors make in writing HTML documents. NekoHTML adds 
missing parent elements; automatically closes elements with 
optional end tags; and can handle mismatched inline element tags. 
</p>

<p>
NekoHTML is written using the Xerces Native Interface (XNI) that 
is the foundation of the Xerces2 implementation. This enables you 
to use the NekoHTML parser with existing XNI tools without 
modification or rewriting code. 
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>

Changes from the previous release include:
</p>

<ul>
	<li> Properties to control 
	the case of element and attribute  names</li>
	<li> Only known HTML elements 
	 have their names modified according to the properties </li>
	<li> New property to set the default encoding </li>

	Specification</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
I have to read through these more carefully, but there don't seem to be any fundamental changes since the last drafts. 
(e.g. the abstract schemas model still only really works for DTDs and the W3C XML Schema Language, not RELAX or Schematron.)
However, a lot of the method signatures have been changed, along with other details. The biggest changes are in the abstract schemas API.

I've posted the first draft of
 <cite><a href="http://cafeconleche.org/books/xmljava/chapters/ch17.html">XSLT</a></cite>, Chapter 17 of <cite><a href="http://cafeconleche.org/books/xmljava/">Processing XML with Java</a></cite> on Cafe con Leche.

This chapter includes three major sections:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>A brief XSLT tutorial</li>
	<li>Detailed discussion of the TrAX API for interating XSLT with Java</li>
	<li>Writing XSLT extension functions and elements in Java</li>
</ul>

<p>
I'm particularly pleased with the first section. I've written several XSLT tutorials before, but this one is radically different. It considers XSLT primarily as a functional programming language and focuses on the ability to call templates recursively. I doubt there's anything here that hasn't been discovered or invented by someone somewhere before, but certainly I had never seen some of the things you could do with XSLT until I invented them for this chapter. I wouldn't recommend this as your first exposure to XSLT (for that see <a href="http://cafeconleche.org/books/biblegold/chapters/ch17.html">Chapter 17 of the XML Bible</a> ) but if you're already familiar with XSLT basics, this chapter may show you a few new tricks. 
</p>

<p>
The end is in sight. I've just got a couple more quick chapters about JDOM to write and a few appendixes and I'll be done. This book may yet see print this Spring as planned. Keep your fingers crossed. 
As usual all comments and criticisms are appreciated.

Aleksander Slominski and Stefan Haustein
have released the <a href="http://www.xmlpull.org/">XMLPULL API 1.0</a>,
a Common API for XML Pull Parsing.
At a high level, pull parsing is similar to SAX push parsing 
in that the parts of a document are presented to a program sequentially, one at a time, in the order they appear in the document. Thus it's fairly memory efficient.
However, it differs from SAX in that the client program must explicitly request the next part when it's ready for it rather than having it automatically pushed to it. 
</p>

<p>
This is  
XMLPULL
 is a minimalist API derived from kXML and XPP.
 It can be implemented from scratch or on top 
  on top of existing XML parsers.
Like SAX, XMLPULL is in the public domain.
Two implementations of the XMLPULL API are 
currently available:  <a href="http://www.kxml.org">kXML2</a> and
<a href="http://www.extreme.indiana.edu/soap/xpp">XPP3</a>.

that does not support choices, references, or recursion. 
It does support  JDBC mapping to an SQL table and reading
    from joined tables.

<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-DOM-Level-3-XPath-20020328">Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 XPath Specification</a>.
At first glance the changes since the last draft seem quite minor. 
Now I have to update <a href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xmljava/chapters/ch16.html">Chapter 16</a> of <a href="books/xmljava/">Processing XML with Java</a>. 
I have to say I'm not very thrilled by this API, but at least it's not as abysmal as DOM 3 Abstract Schemas.

The Apache Project has released
<a href="http://xml.apache.org/cocoon">Cocoon 2.0.2</a>, "an XML framework that raises the usage of
    XML and XSLT technologies for server applications to a new level.
    Designed for performance and scalability around pipelined SAX
    processing, Cocoon offers a flexible environment based on the
    separation of concerns between content, logic and style.
    A centralized configuration system and sophisticated caching
    top this all off and help you to create, deploy and maintain
    rock-solid XML server applications."
Version 2.0.2 is "a maintainance release focusing on
    improved performance and robustness. In addition some bugs were
    fixed and new features were added."
    New features include:
</p>


<ul>
<li>A  BootstrapServlet that lets Cocoon run in non-compliant servlet
engines that don't handle correctly servlet contexts. </li>

<li> Error reporting includes the line, column and location attributes
specified in SAXException and TransformerException.</li>

<li>New "set-content-length" configuration for FOPSerializer to allow
streaming of large PDFs </li>

<li>New POI HSSF Serializer; outputs to the .xls (not .xsl) file format.</li>

<li> New module structure for input, output, and database specifica in
scratchpad. Thus it is possible to write generic components for one task and
replace input and output dynamically. </li>
<li> A new Jisp based persistence cache, to improve (1) performance and
(2) to solve the problem with long filenames on Windows OS flavours.</li>
<li> An encodeURL transformer for encoding URIs. </li>

</ul>

<p> According to the Requirements intro, "XML-based public key
management should be designed to meet two general goals. The first is to
support a simple client's ability to make use of sophisticated key
management functionality. The second is to provide public key management
support to XML applications that is consistent with the XML [XML]
architectural approach. In particular, it is a goal of XML key
management to support the public key management requirements of XML
Encryption [XML Encryption] and XML Digital Signature [XMLDSIG] and to
be consistent with the Security Assertion Markup Language [SAML]. This
specification provides requirements for XML key management consistent
with these goals." </p>

The W3C RDF Core Working Group has published 
the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-rdf-syntax-grammar-20020325">first public working draft of
<cite>RDF/XML Syntax Specification (Revised)</cite></a>.
According to the abstract, this "specification defines an XML syntax for the Resource Description Framework (RDF) as amended and clarified by the RDF Core Working Group from that originally described in RDF Model &amp; Syntax. The syntax is updated to be specified in terms of the XML Information Set with new support for XML Base. For each part of the syntax, it defines the mapping rules for generating the RDF graph as defined in the RDF Model Theory. This is done using the N-Triples graph serializing test format which enables more precise recording of the mapping in a machine processable and testable form. These tests are gathered and published in the RDF Test Cases."
</p>

<p>
The same working group has also published for the first time
an
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-rdf-primer-20020319/"><cite>RDF Primer</cite></a>.
According to its abstract,
"The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a general-purpose language for representing information in the World Wide Web. It is particularly intended for representing metadata about Web resources, such as the title, author, and modification date of a Web page, the copyright and syndication information about a Web document, the availability schedule for some shared resource, or the description of a Web user's preferences for information delivery. RDF provides a common framework for expressing this information in such a way that it can be exchanged between applications without loss of meaning. Since it is a common framework, application designers can leverage the availability of common RDF parsers and processing tools. Exchanging information between different applications means that the information may be made available to applications other than those for which it was originally created. This Primer is designed to provide the reader the basic fundamentals required to effectively use RDF in their particular applications."

Norm Walsh has 
posted version 1.50.0 of his 
<a href="http://docbook.sourceforge.net/projects/xsl/">XSL stylesheets for DocBook</a>.
I use these to format <cite><a href="books/xmljava">Processing XML with Java</a></cite>, both the HTML and the PDF versions.
</p>

<p>
Version 1.5 fixes some (though not all) of the problems 
with synopsis formatting in XSL-FO. However, it introduces soem major issues with program listings in justified text and adds an extra inch or so of top marghin on all of my pages, for reasons I haven't yet determined.
The HTML stylesheets now use the <code>em</code> element for emphasis instead of <code>i</code>. Otherwise, they're mostly unchanged.
For the moment, I'm sticking to version 1.4.8 and recommend you do so too.

I've posted <cite><a href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xmljava/chapters/ch16.html">XPath</a></cite>, Chapter 16 of <a href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xmljava/">Processing XML with Java</a>, here on Cafe con Leche.
It covers integrating XPath searches into your programs, a little-known but very powerful technique that should be in every XML developer's toolbox. 
XPath based programs are often far more robust and reliable than programs 
that use SAX or DOM to perform tree navigation and searching. 
	XPath searches will often succeed even when the document format is not
	quite what you expected. For example, a comment in the middle of a
	paragraph of text may break DOM code that expects to see contiguous
	text. XPath wouldn’t be phased by this. Many XPath expressions are
	resistant even to much more significant alterations such as changing
	the names or namespaces of ancestor elements or adding or subtracting
	levels from the tree hierarchy. While you could write your
	SAX/DOM/JDOM programs to handle these cases, it's about a hundred
	times easier to do it with XPath.
</p>

<p>
	For developers who aren't yet familiar with XPath, this chapter also
	includes with a brief tutorial on the XPath data model and expression
	syntax. Although I've written things like this before, this is the
	first one to treat XPath  from the perspective of a Java developer
	using XPath  rather than mainly as a part of XSLT. </p>

	<p> Although I'm writing out of order right now, nothing in this
	chapter depends on anything in the unpublished chapters 14 and 15. If
	you've read the DOM chapters (or are reasonably familiar with DOM),
	you know everything you need to know before digging into this one. As
	usual, I'd like to hear of any comments, criticisms, corrections,
	caveats, calumnies, and any other C-words you may care to lob in my
	direction about this chapter.

<a href="http://www.germane-software.com/software/rexml/">REXML 2.0</a> is an open source, non-validating
 XML parser for Ruby that includes incomplete XPath support. 
 The author says he based the design on ElectricXML, which worries me because 
 ElectricXML is easily the least correct Java API I've seen for processing XML.
 (A lot of novice developers like ElectricXML because it cuts corners to 
  make XML seem less complex than it really is. An API should be as simple as it can possibly be and no simpler.) However, I don't know anything about Ruby, and can't really judge whether ElectricXML's problems have been corrected in REXML or not. 
 REXML is implemented in pure Ruby. It is dual licensed under both

<p>
In addition, this draft suggests a new way to use these characters in 
XML documents without DTDs through "XML character elements". This is an element named character in the http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xmlcharent/names namespace, whose <code>name</code> or <code>entity</code> attribute identifies the character to use. For example, 
</p>


<pre><code>&lt;doc xmlns:e="http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xmlcharent/names">
  &lt;p>
    This document uses the character names element to access

these document exchanges. WSCL conversation definitions are
themselves XML documents and can therefore be interpreted by Web

The Apache XML Project has released

<a href="http://software.decisionsoft.com/tools.html">DecisionSoft</a> has released two open source XML utilities  written in Perl:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>xmlpp pretty prints and indents XML documents.</li>
	<li>xmldiff compares XML documents for differences</li>
</ul>

<p>
However, xmlpp and perhaps xmldiff suffer from some common novice misconceptions about XML. In particular:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>White space doesn't matter. </li>
	<li>Mixed content doesn't exist.</li>
</ul>

<p>
While these are sometimes true of specific XML vocabularies 
(though much less often than is commonly thought) neither of these is true in general, and utilities that operate on arbitary XML documents should handle this.
However, the tools 
are open source so maybe some Perl XML whiz can fix them.
Both use only standard perl modules and therefore should run
from almost all Perl installations.

<a href="http://ejen.sourceforge.net">Ejen</a> 
 is a GPL'd text generation system (where 
 text includes programming source code) that uses Java/XML/XSLT technologies and is implemented as an Ant task. "This implementation allows the setup of a complete generation, compilation and deployment sequence, by maintaining only one 'build' file that indicates the order in which each of these actions must be achieved.
Generally speaking, this system should be understood as a system that organizes a data flow, whose initial source is an XML file containing a (minimal) set of data (required by the generation process). The data flow grows by the fusion with other XML files and by going through XSL 'filters', until it is sufficiently detailed. It finally goes through XSL 'templates' to produce the resulting text files."
A demo of  an EJB 1.1 generation process is provided.

Norm Walsh and Eve Maler of Sun have submitted a note to the W3C on
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/NOTE-xml-pipeline-20020228/">XML Pipeline Definition Language Version 1.0</a>.
Accoring to the abstract, "Pipeline is an XML vocabulary for describing the processing relationships between XML resources. A pipeline document specifies the inputs and outputs to XML processes and a pipeline controller uses this document to figure out the chain of processing that must be executed in order to get a particular result." The detailed syntax looks a lot like ant, but its focused on XML rather than
Java. It's important to note that this is just a note, and the W3C is not obligated to follow up on it. However, like RDDL and RELAX NG, that doesn't mean third parties can't work together and build tools around this, even if the W3C ignores it.

the  open source
<a href="http://xml.apache.org/xindice">Xindice

XIndice
supports XPath for queries and XML:DB XUpdate for XML updates. The

It means that XML queries and responses have to be hidden inside #PCDATA. If SOAP were used instead of XML-RPC, then actual XML documents could be passed back and forth.)

The W3C Patent Policy Working Group has published
a working draft of 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-patent-policy-20020226">Royalty-Free Patent Policy</a>.
This is close to a 180 degrree shift in W3C thinking on the issues.
A couple of relevant quotes:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
In order to promote the widest adoption of Web standards, W3C seeks to issue Recommendations that can be implemented on a Royalty-Free (RF) basis. Under this policy, W3C will not approve a Recommendation if it is aware that Essential Claims exist which are not available on Royalty-Free terms.
</p>

<p>
To this end, RF Working Group charters will include as a requirement that the specification produced by the Working Group will be implementable on an RF basis, to the best ability of the Working Group and the Consortium.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This is actually stronger than it sounds because the W3C is using an unusual definition of "royalty-free" that covers not just royalties but any form of payment.
</p>

<p>
Even more importantly,
participation in development of a spec now requires particpants to 
provide royalty-free patent licenses:
</p>

<blockquote>
As a condition of participating in a Working Group, each W3C Member and invited expert agrees to make any Essential Claims it controls available on RF terms, as defined in this policy. With the exception of the provisions of section 2.2 below, this licensing commitment is binding on participants for the life of the patents in question, regardless of changes in participation status or W3C Membership.
</blockquote>

<p>
Participants can exclude specific patents, but only within 60 days of publication of the relevant requirements document or working draft.
Furthermore, if an essential patent is excluded a
 Patent Advisory Group (PAG) will be 
 formed. This group will determine whether:
</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
	<li>The initial concern has been resolved, enabling the Working Group to continue.</li>
	<li>The Working Group should be instructed to consider designing around the identified claims.</li>
	<li>The Team should seek further information and evaluation, including but not limited to evaluation of the patents in question or the terms under which acceptable licensing may be available.</li>
	<li>The specification under development should be produced on RAND (reasonable and non-discriminatory) terms, either at W3C or some other body. Note that there is not yet any process for developing or issuing RAND specifications. Therefore if a PAG makes a recommendation to proceed on RAND terms, Advisory Committee review and Director's decision will be required. It is also possible that a PAG could recommend that the work be taken to another organization.</li>
	<li>The Working Group should be terminated.</li>
	<li>The Recommendation (assuming it has already been issued) should be rescinded.</li>
</ol>

</blockquote>

<p>
Overall, this document demonstrates a clear presumption in favor of patent-unencumbered technologies. However, it does allow an escape hatch 
when a patent-holder is simply not willing to budge.

system. Because of this you will find many references to
VoiceXML's capabilities and limitations. You will also find
details on how VoiceXML and CCXML can be integrated. However it

The W3C XML Core Working Group has published the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/CR-xinclude-20020221">Candidate
Recommendation of XInclude</a>. The big change in this draft is the
additon of an <code>xinclude:fallback</code> element to provide an
alternative in the event that a requested resource can't be found; e.g.
</p>

<pre><code>&lt;xinclude:include href="remotefile.xml" parse="xml"&gt;>
  &lt;xinclude:fallback>Oops! Couldn't find remotefile.xml! &lt;/xinclude:fallback>
&lt;/xinclude:include></code></pre>

<p>
Previously, the XInclude processor was required to give up and
report an error if a resource couldn't be found. (It still is if there's no 
<code>xinclude:fallback</code> element.)
Overall, this strikes me as a good idea, and the syntax seems reasonable. However, I do wish that W3C Working Groups would issue new working drafts before adding such major functionality. Past experience indicates that if I did have a big problem with this, the only response I'd get from the working group would be that it was too late in the process to change it. 
</p>

<p>
Other changes include using IURI references instead of URI references.
The difference is that an IURI can use non-ASCII characters like &alpha; and &eacute; directly without escaping them first. 
There are also a number of clean-ups in the sepcification text. For instance,
the spec acknowledges that attribute types and namespaces may have to be fixed up in the inclusion process and
the proper handling of XPointers that select points is 
specifcally addressed in the spec. 
</p>

<p>
These changes don't seem too hard to integrate into my <a href="XInclude/">XInclude processor</a>.
I've also recently begun working on making the DOM version a lot more robust so it should work with more DOM implementations. 
</p>

In an end-run around the W3C XPointer Working Group, 
Jonathan Borden and Simon St. Laurent
have submitted a draft of 
 "<a href="http://ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-borden-frag-00.txt">A generic 
fragment identifier syntax for URI references</a>" to the IETF.
Like the current version of XPointer it
has 3 forms:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Bare names such as <code>#foo</code></li>
	<li>Child sequences (a.k.a tumblers) such as <code>#/1/4/2</code></li>
	<li>Scheme based fragments such as
	 <code>#xpath(/foo/bar[3])</code> and
	 <code>#xpointer(start-point(/foo/bar[3]))</code>
	 </li>
</ul>

<p>
Borden points out that,
"It would be possible to drop the xpointer scheme and 
this draft becomes a very compact fragment identifier 
syntax for XML -- as well as being patent unencumbered"

However, I really need to test that out. Update: I've tried it, and it's still broken.

<p>
The Apache XML Project has released
<a href="http://xml.apache.org/security/">XML Security v1.0.0</a>
(Web site not yet updated).
This 
is an implementation of
 security related XML standards
 including Canonical XML,
 and XML Signature Syntax and Processing.
A compatible Java Cryptography Extension provider
is required.
</p>

<p>
I was playing with this about a week ago when the version number was 0.0.1,
and I have to say that unless a lot of work has happened in the last week,
that's a much more accurate version number than 1.0.0.
XML Security is incompatible with Java 1.4 and all versions of Xalan earlier than 2.2.0.
(Java 1.4 bundles Xalan-J 2.2d10.) After much effort and with some assistance 
from the developers I was able to get this to compile. However, I never got it to run successfully and produce a digital signature or an encrypted document.
</p>

<p>
The dependence on the JCE is a large part of the usability problems in XML Security. 
Sun's efforts to comply with various laws regarding encryption have made the JCE so complex as to be virtually unusable in practice. I think the time has come for open source developers in countries not restricted by U.S. law to replace the JCE entirely, and deliberately design a crypto API from the ground up that is <strong>not compatible</strong> with the JCE and thus not encumbered by 
the JCE's baroque design.

<p>
I've posted <a href="books/xmljava/chapters/ch13.html">Output from DOM</a>,
Chapter 13 of <cite>Processing XML with Java</cite>.
This chapter answers the question of how, once you've
built a DOM document in memory, to you stuff it back into a text file.
The answers are distressingly implementation dependent, but I tried to stick to the most broadly useful techniques.
This chapter includes a lot of bleeding edge material from DOM Level 3 and Xerces-2.
</p>

<p>
This is the last major chapter I have planned on DOM. Chapters 9 through 13 
cover pretty much the entire range of the Document Object Model Level 2, with
more than a few excursions into DOM3. Possibly, I'll add a chapter on
abstract schemas at a later point if the implementations gel enough by the time I have to hand over the finished book to the publisher,
and I'll probably discuss DOM3 XPath in Chapter 16. 
However, right now these five chapters pretty effectively cover the state of the art in DOM programming. The next two chapters are scheduled to cover JDOM, but I'm probably going to go out of order and write chapters 16 and 17 next. These cover XPath and XSLT APIs .
</p>

<p>
Speaking of bleeding edge features in Xerces 2.0,
Andy Clark's 
written <a href="http://www.apache.org/~andyc/">NekoHTML</a>,

and now HTML.
It's currently only available under an "experimental" license; i.e. you can play with it but not use it for real work.

Peter Murray-Rust and Henry Rzepa

<ul>
	<li>Numeric data, with scientific units</li>
	<li>Regular structures of homogeneous data types (arrays, matrixes, tables)</li>
	<li>Containers for metadata</li>
	<li>Dictionaries for scientific terms, including dictionary-driven
	constraints (datatypes, values, enumerations, etc.)</li>
	<li>Abstract objects for scientific discourse (object, action, observation, etc.)</li>

The W3C DOM Activity has published new working drafts of 
the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-DOM-Level-3-XPath-20020208">Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 XPath Specification</a>
and the
 <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-DOM-Level-3-Events-20020208">Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 Events Specification</a>.
The XPath specification defines a basic API for using XPath expressions like <code>/song/composer/first_name</code> to select nodes from a DOM 
<code>Document</code> object. 
The events specification "defines the Document Object Model Events Level 3, a platform- and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure and style of documents. The Document Object Model Events Level 3 builds on the Document Object Model Events Level 2." DOM3 events 
adds  <code>EventListenerList</code>, <code>EventGroup</code>, <code>EventTargetGroup</code>, <code>DocumentEventGroup</code>, and <code>TextEvent</code> interfaces.

Tim Bray's posted a "thought experiment" for <a href="http://www.textuality.com/xml/xmlSW.html">XML Skunk Works</a>,
a new version of XML that's mostly compatible with exisitng XML parsers and practice.
It does this by subsetting XML to remove internal DTD subsets 
(with external DTD subsets strongly deprecated). 
This has the effect of removing entities as well. 
It adds namespaces, <code>xml:base</code>, and the infoset into the core specification. 
The resulting specification is much cleaner and easier to copmprehend than the originals. 
It focuses almost entirely on well-formedness, with validity left to other specs like schemas.
If differs from XML 1.1 in that the XML 1.0 character rules are maintained, although this will probably be changed in a future draft.
It differs from efforts like <a href="http://www.docuverse.com/smldev/minxml.html">Minimal XML</a> in that the spec does not simplify XML for parser writers at the cost of complexifying it for document authors
(e.g. CDATA sections and empty-element tags are retained). 
</p>

<p>
I'm not sure what I think of this yet. 
It looks promising, especially since it seems possible that the set of all SkunkWorks documents might be a proper subset of the set of all XML 1.0 documents. 
This would allow existing parsers to work unchanged on SkunkWorks documents, something that is decidedly not true of XML 1.1. That would be a very good thing.
At the same time, there are some signifcant costs to this proposal.
For instance, it would no longer be possible to define character entities like
<code>&amp;copy;</code> and <code>&amp;nbsp;</code> in XML documents.
That's a major loss. It will be interesting to see where this goes.

John Cowan's begun work on
 <cite><a href="http://www.ccil.org/~cowan/XML/afng.html">Architectural Forms: A New Generation</a></cite> (current draft version 2.1). From the draft:
</p>

<blockquote cite="http://home.ccil.org/~cowan/XML/afng.html">
<p>
AF:NG provides the facilities, but does not employ the syntax, of SGML Architectural Forms. AF:NG is intended to be used in conjunction with the schema language RELAX NG, but is not dependent on it in any way.
</p>

<p>
The purpose of AF:NG is to provide for tightly specified transformations of XML documents, consisting of renaming or omitting elements, attributes, and character data. AF:NG is not intended as a general-purpose transformation language like XSLT or Omnimark. Using AF:NG, a recipient may, instead of specifying a schema to which documents must conform exactly, specify a schema to be applied to the output of an AF:NG transformation. In that way, the actual element and attribute names, and to some degree the document structure, may vary from the schema without rendering the document unacceptable. In particular, it is easy to use AF:NG to reduce a complex document to a much simpler one, when only a subset of the document is of interest to the recipient.

I tried out <a href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces2-j/">Xerces 2.0.0</a>
yesterday, and so far I'm not too happy with it. It definitely breaks my
DOM XInclude processor (which was also broken with Xerces 1.4.4, but
worked with Xerces 1.4.3.) The DOM Level 3 experimental material is all
in the wrong packages, and requires using Xerces-specific classes. Thus
you can use these classes, but you can't construct them in the way the
DOM3 specs intend. The API documentation is divided into multiple sets
for each API (i.e. one for DOM3, one for XNI, one for implementation
classes, etc.) which makes browsing the documentation a lot more
difficult. For the moment, I've reverted to Xerces-J 1.4.3.

<p>
The XML Apache Project has released <a
href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces2-j/index.html">Xerces-J 2.0.0</a>, an
open source, schema-validating XML parser written in Java. The internals
of Xerces-J have been rewritten from the ground up to be much cleaner,
much more extensible, and much more comprehensible. Xerces 2 introduces
the Xerces Native Interface (XNI). XNI is a streaming API, similar in
design to SAX. However, it attempts to provide more information than
SAX2 does including the XML declaration, CDATA sections, parameter
entities, text declarations, conditional sections in DTDs, and various
post-schema-validation-infoset (PSVI) information. Of course Xerces also
supports DOM1, DOM2, SAX1, SAX 2, and JAXP 1.1. There's some
experimental support for DOM Level 3 including the Core, abstract
schemas, and load and save modules.
</p>

<p>
 Programs that only use the standard APIs to access Xerces-1 should continue to run with Xerces-2 without even a recompile. However, the parser is supposed to be faster and use less memory, especially when it comes to schemas. Doubtless a few bugs and inconsistencies will surface as this makes its way out into the broader community, but past exxperience with Xerces suggests these will be fixed reasonably quickly. 
</p>

<p>
I intend to upgrade immediately because I need to explore some of the new features for <cite><a href="books/xmljava/">Processing XML with Java</a></cite>, as well as my upcoming <cite>Bleeding Edge of XML</cite> tutorial at XML and Web Services 2002 in London in March. A large portion of that session is going to focus on the new DOM3 features in Xerces. However, I recommend that most users stick with Xerces-J 1.4.3 (1.4.4 was too buggy to recommend.) 
for a few more point releases while the bugs get shaken out and the APIs stabilize. DOM3 and XNI are still subject to change.

The Platform for Privacy Preferences 1.0 (P3P1.0) Specification</a>.
P3P enables Web sites to express their privacy practices in a standard 
XML format that can be retrieved automatically and interpreted  by browsers. P3P aware browsers
 "allow users to be informed of site practices (in both machine- and human-readable formats) and to automate decision-making based on these practices when appropriate. Thus users need not read the privacy policies at every site they visit.
</p>

<p>
"Although P3P provides a technical mechanism for ensuring that users can be informed about privacy policies before they release personal information, it does not provide a technical mechanism for making sure sites act according to their policies. Products implementing this specification MAY provide some assistance in that regard, but that is up to specific implementations and outside the scope of this specification. However, P3P is complementary to laws and self-regulatory programs that can provide enforcement mechanisms. In addition, P3P does not include mechanisms for transferring data or for securing personal data in transit or storage. P3P may be built into tools designed to facilitate data transfer. These tools should include appropriate security safeguards."

Media Queries</a>.
According to the abstract:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
HTML4 and CSS2 currently support media-dependent style sheets tailored for different <em>media types</em>. For example, a document may use sans-serif fonts when displayed on a screen and serif fonts when printed. "Screen" and "print" are two of media types that have been defined. <em>Media queries</em> extend the functionality of media types by allowing more precise labeling of style sheets.
</p>

<p>
A media query consists of a media type and one or more expressions to limit the scope of style sheets. Among the <em>media features</em> that can be used in media queries are "width", "height", and "color". By using media queries, presentations can be tailored to a specific range of output devices without changing the content itself.

I'm happy to announce that I've posted "<a href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xmljava/chapters/ch10.html">Creating New XML Documents with DOM</a>," Chapter 10 of Processing XML with Java, here
on Cafe con Leche.
This chapter covers the <code>Document</code> and <code>DOMImplementation</code> interfaces with a particular focus on how you use DOM to create new XML in documents and elements in memory rather than parsing them from a file. The last section discusses some new bleeding edge features from DOM3.
</p>

<p>
This chapter includes some interesting examples of SOAP and XML-RPC servlets. I've also gone back to the earlier chapters, particularly 2, 3, and 5, and rewritten the SOAP and XML-RPC client examples so that they point at my personal server at www.elharo.com. The firewall is open on port 80 so if you want to test those examples out, feel free. This is just a small Linux box running off my DSL connection so please don't hit it too hard. Also, I've been playing around with the DNS and web servers for both macfaq.com and elharo.com to get them working together on the same box, so if you notice anything funny like hosts not resolving or the wrong site coming up, please let me know. I think it's all working now, but I've said that before. :-)
</p>

<p>
One warning: the examples in this chapter use JAXP's ID transform for serialization. In the process of writing this chapter, I uncovered some nasty bugs in common implementations of the <code>javax.xml.transform</code> classes, particularly involving the output of namespace declaration attributes. I've reported the bugs to the various parser vendors and I'm hopeful they'll be fixed soon. In the meantime, not all the examples will produce namespace-well-formed output.
</p>

<p>
Together Chapters 9 through 12 form a really solid introduction to the  Document Object Model. In fact, I think Chapters 1 through 12 are a really solid introduction to processing XML with Java and form the core of the book. 
There are still several chapters and appendixes to go. Nonentheless, I'd certainly feel comfortable using this as the text for a course in XML as stands, perhaps in combination with a more introductory book about XML syntax like 
the <cite><a href="books/bible2/">XML Bible</a></cite>.

The W3C  has published a note
on <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/NOTE-patent-practice-20020124">Current Patent Practice</a>. According to the abstract:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
This current practice has evolved in order to satisfy the goal held by a number of W3C Members and significant parts of the larger Web community: that W3C Recommendations should be, as far as possible, implementable on a Royalty-Free basis [AC]. The current practice described here seeks to
</p>


<ul>
	<li>establish Royalty-Free implementation as a goal for Recommendations produced by new and re-chartered Working Groups;</li>
	<li>encourage maximum disclosure of patents that might prevent a W3C Recommendation from being implemented on a Royalty-Free basis;</li>
	<li>provide a process for addressing situations in which the goal of Royalty-Free implementation may not be attainable.</li>
</ul>


<p>
This document relies on the definition of Royalty-Free licensing as described in the W3C Patent Policy Framework Last Call Working Draft [PATENT-POLICY]. Note that current W3C patent practice does not require any W3C Member to make a Royalty-Free licensing commitment for essential patents it may hold. Such a commitment is under discussion in the Patent Policy Working Group for possible inclusion in of the final patent policy, but has not been implemented.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This seems to be heading in the right direction, though I think that 
member commitments to license essential patents is stil necessary.

 <a href="http://www.rpbourret.com/xmldbms/">XML-DBMS version 2.0</a>,
 open source middleware in both Java and Perl for transferring data between XML
documents and a relational database. XML-DBMS uses an object-relational
mapping in which complex element types are viewed as classes and simple
element types, attributes, and PCDATA are viewed as properties. An
XML-based mapping language is used to specify the mapping for a given
class of documents. Version 2.0 is
an "almost a complete rewrite of version 1.01 and includes the
following new features: updates (including insert-or-update), a filter
language, heterogeneous joins, inlining elements (denormalizing XML
structure), support for database-generated keys, connection and
statement pooling, support for abstract types, and enhanced formatting
capabilities."

The Breeze Factor has released version 3.0 of their 
  <a href="http://www.breezefactor.com/overview.html">XML Binder for Java</a>, another one of 
  numerous 
  XML/Java Data-Binding Solutions.
  This one's $395 payware.
New features since its previous incarnation as
Breeze XML Studio 2.2 include:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Binding XML Schema to Java</li>
	<li> Namespace support</li>
	<li>DOM interoperability</li>
	<li>Speed-ups</li>
	<li>More Code-Generation Control</li>
	<li>Automated compilation</li>
<li>Limited JAXB compatibility</li>
</ul>


<p>
My problem with these sorts of tools, of which JaxMe seems to be a
fairly typical example, is that they start with the question of "How do
I get an object/database record into an XML document?" rather than the
much tougher question of "How do I get an XML document into an object?"
This is a toothpaste problem: it's a lot easier to squirt XML out of a
Java object than to push it back in. Most of these tools claim to be
able to read XML documents into Java, but fail very quickly as soon as
you start throwing real-world documents at them. Generally speaking the
developers designing these tools are laboring under numerous faulty
assumptions, including:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>Documents have W3C XML Schema language schemas. (The vast majority don't.)</p></li>
	<li><p>Documents have some kind of schema. (Many, perhaps most, don't.)</p></li>
	<li><p>Documents that actually have schemas of some kind do in fact adhere to those schemas. (Often untrue)</p></li>
  <li><p>You know the sorts of structures you're going to encounter before you see the documents. In other words, the docuemnts are predictable. 
(Not an unreasonable assumption, but nonetheless often untrue in practice.)
</p></li>

	<li><p>Mixed content doesn't exist. (Patently false)</p></li>
	<li><p>XML documents are fairly flat. In particular they have nearly tabular 
	structures. 
	(The database mapping folks tend to make this assumption. The object folks are a little less likely to fall into this particular trap.)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
The fact is, XML documents considered in their full generality are
extremely complicated. They are not tables. They are not objects. Any
reasonable model for them has to take this complexity into account. You
can certainly design mappings for XML to Java, but unless you're working
in a very restricted domain, its questionable whether you can up with
anything much simpler than JDOM.  And if you are working in a restricted
domain, then all you really need is a standard way of serializing and
deserializing particular Java classes to and from a particular XML
format. This can be almost hidden from the client programmer. For Java
programmers who just want to serialize and deserialize I think tools
like JaxMe are too complex. For those of use who need to work with XML
as XML, it's into complex enough. XML binding tools like this fall right
in the sour spot between simple and powerful, not easy enough to be
simple, not sophisticated enough to be powerful.

<p><code>public void normalizeDocument();<br />
public boolean canSetNormalizationFeature(String name, boolean state);<br />
public void setNormalizationFeature(String name, boolean state)
 throws DOMException;<br />
public boolean getNormalizationFeature(String name)
 throws DOMException;</code></p>

<p>
Standard normalization features (which not all implementations may support) include:
</p>

<ul>
<li><code>normalize-characters</code>:
Perform the W3C Text Normalization of the characters
in the document.</li>
<li><code>split-cdata-sections</code>:
Split CDATA sections containing the CDATA section termination
marker <code>]]&gt;</code>  and issue a warning.</li>
<li><code>expand-entity-references</code>:
expand <code>EntityReference</code> nodes</li>
<li><code>whitespace-in-element-content</code>:
Keep or discard all white space in element content 
in the document.</li>
<li><code>discard-default-content</code>:
Use whatever information available to the implementation (i.e. XML
schema, DTD, the <code>specified</code> flag on 
<code>Attr</code> nodes, etc.) to decide what attributes and content should be discarded or
not. </li>
<li><code>format-canonical</code>:
Canonicalize the document according to the rules specified by 
Canonical
XML</li>

<li><code>format-pretty-print</code>:

Format the document by adding whitespace to produce a
pretty-printed, indented, human-readable form. </li>

<li><code>namespace-declarations</code>:

Include or discard the
namespace declaration attributes, specified or defaulted
from the schema or the DTD, in the document.
</li>

<li><code>validation</code>:
Use the abstract schema to validate the document as it is being
normalized. If validation errors are found the error handler is
notified. </li>

<li><code>external-parameter-entities</code>:
Load external parameter entities. </li>

<li><code>external-general-entities</code>:
Include all external general (text) entities. </li>

<li><code>external-dtd-subset</code>:
Load the external DTD subset and also all external parameter
entities. </li>


<li><code>validate-if-schema</code>: Validate
only if the document being processed has some kind of
 schema (e.g.
W3C XML Schema Language 
 schema, DTD, Relax-NG, etc.)
</li>

<li><code>validate-against-dtd</code>:

Prefer validation against the DTD over any other schema used with
the document. </li>

<li><code>datatype-normalization</code>:

Let the (non-DTD) validation process do its datatype normalization
that is defined in the schema language. 
</li>

<li><code>create-entity-ref-nodes</code>:

Create <code>EntityReference</code> nodes
in the document. 
</li>

<li><code>create-entity-nodes</code>:

Create <code>Entity</code>
nodes in the document. 
</li>
<li><code>create-cdata-nodes</code>:

Keep <code>CDATASection</code>
nodes the document. 

</li>
<li><code>comments</code>:
Keep <a href='core.html#ID-1728279322'><code>Comment</code></a>

The W3C Scalable Vector Graphics  Working Group has published the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-SVG11-20020108/">second
working draft of SVG 1.1</a>, an XML application for vector
graphics. New features in this draft include a W3C XML Schema for
SVG, text wrapping, and geographic coordinate systems.
</p>

<p>
The SVG Working Group has decided against allowing graphical
elements to be described using viewport coordinates in SVG 1.1 so
that, for example, toolbars or map legends could be statically
placed within the user agent viewport and be unaffected by zoom
and pan. This will be revisited for SVG 2.0. Some other necessary
features aren't even mentioned. I have to say that SVG strikes me
as adequate for graphic arts, but completely unsuitable for
technical drawings like CAD diagrams. An SVG document describes
the picture that's going to be put on paper or screen rather than
the real-world object the picture represents. E.g. an SVG
document represents a picture of a house rather than the house
itself.
</p>

<p>
The W3C SVG Working Group has also posted the first public
working draft of <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-SVGMobile-20020108">Mobile SVG
Profiles: SVG Tiny and SVG Basic</a>. This describes two subsets
of SVG for use in small devices like cell phones and Palm Pilots.
</p>

<p> On a positive note, Apple's announced a <a
href="http://www.w3.org/2001/07/SVG10-IPR-statements.html">
royalty-free license</a> for the patent they named early in the
SVG 1.0 process. However, the W3C still won't let non-members
read the license for this or other patent disclosures.
Furthermore, contrary to popular royalty-free is not the same as
free-beer. Apple could offer a royalty-free license that cost
several million dollars, provided only that the price was not
based on the number of copies shipped. And of course there are
still several claims from companies unwilling to offer even
royalty-free licenses, inclusing IBM, Quark and Kodak.

Vancouver-based UFIL Unified Data Technologies is claiming that it owns
a patent that covers the Resource Description Framework. It was awarded
<a
href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1='5,684,985'.WKU.&amp;OS=PN%2F5,684,985&amp;RS=PN%2F5,684,985">U.S. 
patent 5,684,985</a>, a "Method and apparatus utilizing
bond identifiers executed upon accessing of an endo-dynamic information
node" in November 1997. My initial take is that the patent does not
cover RDF, because it does not describe the containment relationship
that is at the heart of all XML documents. In fact, the patent 
specifically distinguishes itself from other methods by avoiding
containment:
</p>

<blockquote>
 logical organization exists when the information atoms are associated
 in different ways to produce a structure. In current information
 organization methodologies, the only kind of association between two
 atoms of information is containment. This is true no matter how evolved
 the containment method may be. For example, in object-oriented
 programming methods, objects can have associated predefined processes,
 where this is accomplished by the object containing the processes or
 references to those processes.
</blockquote>

<p>
However, RDF is a very weird beast in the family of XML specs, so I'm
not at all sure of this.
</p>

<p>
It's not clear if UFIL actually does anything except file patents and
attempt to extort royalties. Their web site (www.udtl.com) is offline.
The whois record points to what sounds like a mailbox store. They've
brought in <a
href="http://www.pearlltd.com/content/investments.html">Patent
Enforcement and Royalties Limited</a>, a public company that specializes
in licensing patents to sue other companies, to pursue litigation
against companies that are claimed to be infringing this patent. UFIL is
not a member of the W3C so any W3C patent policy regarding what rights
members must grant to their patents is irrelevant here.

that converts SAX events into events for one or more DOM Element
handlers provided. The event-handling callbacks get to process entire
elements complete with children and attributes but not siblings. Thus,
your code can process streaming data using DOM with a small memory
imprint.
