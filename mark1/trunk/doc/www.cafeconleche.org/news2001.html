	<li>Java API for XML Messaging (JAXM) v1.0.1 EA1</li>
	<li>Java API for XML Processing (JAXP) v1.2 EA1</li>

I've tried the latest <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/releases/">Mozilla 0.9.7</a> on both Windows and the Mac.
The Windows build fixes the one bug I had noticed in 0.9.6 (a minor problem involving saearch pop-up menus in the location bar). It also lets me configure cookie preferences to exclude them from sites with bad privacy policies, though perhaps that was in earlier versions and I just noticed it now. Windows Mozilla definitely feels ready for prime time.
</p>

<p>
I wish I could say the same about the Mac version though.
It's noticeably slower than IE5.0 for the Mac, and it crashed my systems within minutes of launch. Furthermore, it still has some annoying problems with AppleScript that prevent me from using it as my default browser. In particular, it cannot tell which window is in front. <code>get the front window</code> returns the first window opened, not the window that is currently in front.

The Mozilla Project has posted <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/releases/">version 0.97 of the Mozilla web browser</a>
for the usual batch of platforms.
New features include 
basic S/MIME support, favicon support, and a Document Inspector that provides  live editing of the
DOM of any web document or XUL application.

Antenna House has released version 2.0 of their 
<a href="http://www.antennahouse.com/axf20/AXF20topEN.htm">XSL Formatter</a>, a Windows GUI program for viewing and printing
XSL formatting objects documents.
The major new features are compatibility with the final XSL 1.0 recommendation
and the ability to generate PDF documents from <acronym title="XSL Formatting Objects">XSL-FO</acronym> documents.
</p>

<p>
XSL Formatter costs roughly $2000 for your first copy, significantly less for each additional copy. 
I have to say that this strikes me as vastly overpriced. 
For $80, the cost of an additional license, I would have bought a copy to play around with. For $400, I would have downloaded the evaluation version, checked it out, and if it seemed to work on my documents I would have bought a copy. 
But for $2000, I'll continue to use FOP and PassiveTeX.

  Yes, I know a runaway cron job replaced the December news with
  news from the same date last December.  Possibly a crontab file I'd
  deleted got accidentally restored in a backup. Much more likely, I
  stupidly forgot to delete the old crontab file in the first place.
  Mea culpa. Mea maxima culpa.
</p>

<p>
  I do have a copy of the old December 
  news that got overwritten. Unfortunately, the old news is sitting in
  my Brooklyn apartment two thousand miles away from my parents' house
  in New Orleans where I'm spending the holidays, and for once I did not
  make complete copies of my web sites on my laptop. I tried, but Aladdin's
  StuffIt Deluxe crapped out when it was trying to make the necessary
  zip files, so I didn't get that done. I probably (no, make that
  definitely) should have figured out what the problem was and brought a
  backup with me; but I stupidly figured I could just download it off
  the web and didn't want to waste the extra time. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
  I do have a recent copy 
  of the site on DLT tape with me in case my apartment building goes up in
  flames while I'm away, but unless I can find
  someone friendly in New Orleans with
  Retrospect and a DLT drive, that isn't any immediate help. 
  There are mirror sites, but they haven't been updating since 
  IBiblio switched to Linux and broke the mirror logins months ago. :-(
</p>

<p>
  The short version is that news from the last week or two is temporarily
  lost in the ether. It will come back shortly before New Year's.
  I will still be posting new news here during the meantime. 
  Thanks to everyone who wrote in to warn me of the problem.

The W3C XSLT Working Group has posted the first public working drafts
of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-xslt20-20011220/">XSLT 2.0</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-xpath20-20011220">XPath 2.0</a>. The big new feature in these releases is schema-type awareness, but there's lots more here too including improved grouping, an XHTML output method, integer and single precision arithemtic, number formatting that does not depend on Java, and 
way too much to talk about right before I fly to New Orleans tomorrow for the holidays. &lt;BlatantPlug>If you want to know more about this come here me talk about it on Monday, March 11, at XMLOne London.&lt;/BlatantPlug> by which point I should have had enough time to digest the spec and decide what I think of it.
</p>

<p>
Michael Kay, the editor of the XSLT 2.0 spec, has posted the first release of <a href="http://saxon.sourceforge.net/#F7.0">Saxon 7.0</a>,  an experimental and incomplete implementation of these  XSLT 2.0 and XPath 2.0 working drafts. Production use should continue to rely on XSLT 1.0/XPath 1.0/Saxon 6.5.

Microsoft's released
 <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mac/download/ie/ie51.asp">Internet Explorer 5.1 
  for MacOS 8 and 9</a>.
 This release makes numerous bug fixes and improvements in CSS support.
 Particularly notable is the ability to apply CSS style sheets to 
XML documents (a feature the Windows version of IE has had for several 
years.)
Other new features include the ability to drag and drop arbitrary images and
hyperlinks to the button bar.

The W3C has published four new and revised working drafts about SOAP 1.2 including for the first time a SOAP primer:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-soap12-part0-20011217/">SOAP Version 1.2 Part 0: Primer</a></li>
	<li> <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-soap12-part1-20011217/">SOAP Version 1.2 Part 1: Messaging Framework</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-soap12-part2-20011217/">SOAP Version 1.2 Part 2: Adjuncts</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-xmlp-scenarios-20011217/">XML Protocol Usage Scenarios</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
The SOAP 1.2 namespace is now http://www.w3.org/2001/12/
and will almost certainly chnge again before the final release.
The MIME type has changed from text/xml to 
application/soap+xml to finally application/soap
(which I really don't understand the logic behind. It is still XML after all.)
The SOAP schemas are now compliant with the final release of
the W3C XML Schema Language.
Finally, the spec now denies that SOAP is an acronym for "Simple Object Access Protocol" or anything else.

According to several people
<code>TypeOf</code> is a reasonable equivalent to 
<code>instanceof</code> in Visual Basic.
Thanks to Philip Nelson, Robert A. Casola, and Rob Smith for helping out with this.
</p>

<p>
 The revised question is what languages don't have a reasonable equivalent to <code>instanceof</code>? So far the only ones I've found are JavaScript 1.3 and earlier and some older C++ compilers pre-RTTI. Are there any other lanaguages out there to which the DOM IDL could theoretically be compiled, but which do not have some variant of <code>instanceof</code>?  
</p>

 </dd>
 
	<dt id="news2001December18">Tuesday, December 18, 2001</dt><dd>

<p>
Brendon McKenna showed me where to look for an equivalent of <code>instanceof</code> in Perl. Short answer: it doesn't have one.
Long answer, the <code>ref()</code> function
lets you check a variable's immediate class through string comparison, but not the variable's various superclasses. Update: The
<code>isa()</code> function will correctly compare against superclasses
even if <code>ref()</code> won't.
</p>

<p>
Now I need to ask the same question for 
Visual Basic. Does it have any reasonable equivalent of Java's <code>instanceof</code> operator or any means determining at runtime the type of an unknown object?  Please send any answers to

A number of XML specifications define application-specific document object models that extend the standard DOM. These include WML, SVG, HTML, SMIL, and MathML.
For the next chapter of 
<cite><a href="books/xmljava/">Processing XML with Java</a></cite>,
 I'm looking for parsers that can build these application specific DOMs. So far I've found that the Docuverse DOM SDK can 
build an HTML DOM and with some effort Xerces can be made to build 
HTML and WML DOMs. Does anybody know of any others? I'm particularly interested in a parser that could build a MathML or SVG DOM. Please send any suggestion to

Simon St. Laurent's published 
the first  alpha version of <a href="http://moe.sourceforge.net/">Markup Object Events (MOE)</a>, 
a Mozilla-licensed Java class library
that supports markup processing using both events and object trees.  Accorsing to St. Laurent, "MOE programs can work purely with events, purely with trees, or with combinations of both, effectively providing a "middle way" between SAX and DOM." MOE permits all nodes to have:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>A three-part namespace-aware name (prefix, local name, URI - QName available)</li>

	<li>Unordered content (a set) - think attributes</li>

	<li>Ordered content (a list) - think child elements, text, etc.</li>

	<li>Annotations (a map) - any other information you need, largely unconstrained</li>
</ul>

<p>
My initial impression is that this goes a long way toward reinventing DOM, in a slightly more concrete and Java-centric fashion, with perhaps the one major change that nodes do not have to belong to a document, but can live independently. However, MOE's <code>CoreComponentI</code> really feels to me exactly like DOM's <code>Node</code> interface, even to the point of using integer constants to represent node types.

The W3C XML Core Working Group has just published a very poorly
thought-out <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-xml11-20011213/">initial working
draft of XML 1.1</a>. This basically just describes the changes that
will be necessary to satisfy the very controversial XML Blueberry
requirements. There's one big change since the Blueberry requirements
were published: C0 controls except for null (e.g. bell, vertical tab,
formfeed, etc.) will now be allowed in XML documents. For the life of me
I can't figure out what this is supposed to gain anybody.
</p>

<p>
The restrictions on name characters will be loosened considerably in XML 1.1, so that all Unicode characters which are not specifically forbidden as name characters can now be used in element, attribute, entity and notation names. This will allow native script markup in Ge'ez, Amharic, Tigre, Burmese, Cambodian, and a few other languages, as well as filling a few very minor holes in Chinese and Japanese support.  However, the proposal goes way beyond this.
Many undefined code points are now allowed in names, as are some very weird characters like &copy;, &plusmn;, <sup>7</sup> (&amp;0x2077;, superscript 7),
 the musical symbol for a six-string fretboard, and the zero-width space. 
</p>

<p>
With perhaps one exception, the working group ignored or rejected every single proposal that was made to reduce the massive damage this will do to interoperability.
To summarize:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
  <p>The version number will now be 1.1 instead of 1.0. Even though most of the changes in this draft have little to no effect on the vast majority of users, I expect to be hearing from publishers and readers within 24 hours about when I'll be releasing <cite>The XML 1.1 Bible</cite>, <cite>XML 1.1 in a Nutshell</cite>, etc. These titles aren't actually necessary, but I'm sure myself and other authors will waste a few acres of trees on them nonetheless. </p></li>

<li><p>Many documents will be published with a  1.1 version even though they do not need to be. Existing systems that attempt to process these documents will fail.
Consequently, many organizations will be faced with 
large and unnecessary expenditures to upgrade  software 
in order to support features most users don't actually need. </p>
</li>

<li>
<p>IBM will now be allowed to use non-ASCII characters as white space. 
This will make their lazy programmers happy because they still don't have to conform to the standards the rest of world has been happily using for over two decades. However, the rest of us will now have to deal with IBM generated XML that cannot be edited in a simple text editor and cannot be processed with our existing tools.</p>
</li>

</ul>

The W3C HyperText Coordination Group has published a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/NOTE-CX-20011211">note about the requirements for a Component Extension (CX) API</a>. To quote, from the 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
From the early days of the World Wide Web, Web Agents had been extended to support more types of contents. The recent developments of XML and the possibility to mix multiple XML Namespaces in the document reiterated the need to extend implementations and relaying on add-on softwares to accomplish tasks not supported by default in the implementation. In other words, we have several XML languages to represent different parts of Web pages (XHTML, SVG, MathML, XForms, etc.), we now need a well defined mechanism that allow different specialized tools to work together and handled these compound documents.
</p>

<p>
This W3C Note contains a non-exhaustive list of requirements to work on a Component Extension API. The goal of this API is to extend the ability of a Web application. Note that the Web application can be either on the server side or on a client side, and does not automatically implies interaction with a user or having a Web browser.

Altova has released XML Spy 4.2
Suite, a $399 payware XML editor for Windows.
Upgrades from 4.0 are free.
XML Spy
4.2 Suite consists of three products: XML Spy 4.2 Document Editor, XML
Spy 4.2 XSLT Designer, and XML Spy 4.2 Integrated Development
Environment. Version 4.2 
 adds 
 <a href="http://www.xmlspy.com/soap">SOAP support through WSDL</a>,
  Oracle XML Schema Extensions,
  MSXML4 Support,
  various  XSLT Designer editing enhancements,
  extended Document Editor APIs,
  and various other improvements.
  Version 4.0 was unusable. I'm going to test this version and see if it's any better. 
</p>

<p>
Update: 4.2 is a definite improvement on 4.0. It no longer hangs for several minutes when trying to open my test documents (Docbook documents for various chapters of 
<cite><a href="books/xmljava">Processing XML with Java</a></cite>) so it's no longer completely non-functional. Thus now I have a real chance to actually evaluate the product and its design.
</p>

<p>
After opening my test documents, it was far from obvious how to work with them. I could browse them in a tree view fairly easily, and it wasn't too hard to add a new element declared in the DTD or a new text node.
 However, I could not figure out how to do something as simple as delete a word from the middle of a sentence in an existing text node.
There may be a way to do this, but it wasn't obvious at first glance. It certainly wasn't as simple as selecting the word I wanted to delete and pressing the delete key. 
</p>

<p>
I also found the tree view to be a very unnatural way to edit the sorts of document I write. I much prefer writing in a basic text editor like UltraEdit or 
BBEdit, even if it means I have to type the tags myself.
 Christian Gross showed me a more word processor like view of the document 
 at Software Development in Boston last August, but it's not the default view and I wasn't able to figure out how to turn it on. 
I suppose I should probably read the manual. 
</p>

<p>
Update 2: I found the text view that let's me edit the document more naturally 
by typing words in a row interspersed with tags. This is moderately useful.
I loved the code-completion pop-ups for tag names. Unfortunately, depending on how you're typing in the tags, this has an annoying tendency to delete the following word if there's no white space between the tag and the following word. :-( The more word processor like document view apparently requires me to 
create a custom configuration file in the XSLT designer. I'm not quite sure how to do that since the XSLT designer doesn't have the customary File/New menu item, and the XSLT designer can't seem to open any of my files (DTDs, XSLT stylesheets, or instance documents). I should probably read the manual again.
</p>

<p>
Update 3: OK the online help showed me what I needed. I didn't have to resort to the manual (I'm assuming there is a manual somewhere. I haven't actually looked for it yet. :-)) Apparently, the XSLT designer
should work by opening a DTD or a W3C XML Schema Language schema;
and indeed I was able to get it to work with simple examples from the <cite><a href="books/biblegold/">XML Bible</a></cite>.
However, it simple could not handle the much more complicated real-world DocBook DTD. Consequently, this 
means I can't use XMLSpy to edit my books just yet. :-(

The W3C HTML Activity has posted a new working draft of  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-xforms-20011207/">XForms 1.0</a>.
This describes the "next generation of web forms".
Today's HTML forms don't distinguish between
  the purpose and the presentation of a form.
   XForms, by contrast, have separate sections that describe what the form does  and how the form looks, thus making XForms more suitable for a broad range of media from web browsers to cell phones.
The XForms themselves and the data collected in an XForm and returned to a server
are all written in XML.
An XForms Submit Protocol defines how XForms send and receive data,
including the ability to suspend and resume the completion of a form.
The changes in this release  are too numerous to list here, but are nicely summarized in an <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xforms/sliceE.html">appendix</a>.

a new working draft of 
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-masinter-url-i18n-08.txt">Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRI)</a>.
 An IRI uses Unicode to locate resources in a syntax very similar to that of URIs, and a hex-encoded 
mapping from IRIs to URIs is defined. However, an IRI is not a kind of URI and could not be directly used in XML documents in places where URIs are now required (e.g. system identifiers).

Java application that processes an HTML document saved from
 Word 2000, and transforms it into an XML document and an XSLT stylesheet.
 The XSLT stylesheet can then
 transform the XML document into an XSL-Formatting Objects document.
  You can also apply a stylesheet that converts the XML back into HTML discarding all the extra markup added by Word.

<a href="http://www.pault.com/pault/pxml/pxdb.html">PXDB</a> is a simple Python 
application that takes XML files  and places them into a SQL database. There are  APIs for querying / altering / deleting / ordering / linking. PXDB is like a middle ground between SQL database and XML repository. One can view
PXDB as a strange object database on top of SQL storage, with some elements of XML (CPath). This is a very rough alpha right now.

Netscape's released version <a href="ftp://ftp.netscape.com/pub/netscape6/english/6.2.1/">6.2.1</a> of their namesake web browser that supports XML, CSS, and XSLT.
This is the first release with full native support for MacOS X.
Versions are also available for Windows, classic MacOS, and various Unixes.  
Otherwise, it's not clear what if anything changed. It still seems based on the 
Mozilla code 0.9.4 code base.

The data generation process in ToXgene is based on a conceptual description of the data to be generated (the templates). This tool is intended for cases in which the structure of the data to be generated is known, the data is required to conform to that structure, and multiple collections of documents, with varying structures, sizes and complexities, can easily be generated." In other words, it automatically produces lots of sample documents for an XML application.

I've posted the first draft of <cite><a href="books/xmljava/chapters/ch08.html">SAX Filters</a></cite>, Chapter 8 of <cite><a href="books/xmljava/">Processing XML with Java</a></cite> here on Cafe con Leche.
This chapter covers the <code>XMLFilter</code> interface and  the <code>XMLFilterImpl</code> and <code>AttributesImpl</code> classes. 
This chapter demonstrates how to write filters that modify the stream of events that flows between an XML parser and a client application.

This is a longish chapter, and some of the examples are a bit on the large side. I'm curious to know whether you think they make sense, or whether they're too long to follow. On the flip side, in several examples I've limited myself to only one class of several or even a single method, rather than including the entire set of classes needed to do something useful. I need to know if these are still comprehensible. 
As usual all comments are appreciated.

This is the last tutorial chapter on SAX. There'll be one more reference chapter later on. However, right now the first eight chapters form a very solid introductory text about

will begin the coverage of DOM.

I've installed <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla0.9.6/">Mozilla 0.9.6</a> on both my Mac and my Windows box. My initial impressions are positive. This is an incremental improvement, but not a major step forward. 
I haven't done speed tests myself, but most people I've heard from say that this release is a lot faster than Netscape 6.2 and somewhat fatser than earlier releases of Mozilla.
</p>

<p>
Stylesheet wise, the CSS support still needs some work. In particular, CSS tables don't seem to work with XML documents. XSLT support does seem much improved. In particular, for the first time I was able to load both XML documents and XSLT style sheets from the local file system. 
</p>

<p>
Applescript support is somewhat improved. Opening URLs in new windows works again. However, Mozilla still can't figure out which window is in front, so I'm continuing to use Internet Explorer on my Mac. The lack of a Window menu is also a major shortcoming since I tend to start my day by automatically opening a dozen or so windows on diferent news sites, and like to navigate between them.

<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla0.9.6/">Mozilla 0.9.6</a> has been released for Windows, Linux, Solaris, OpenVMS, and MacOS.
New features include print preview, support for
.BMP and .ICO images on all platforms, and a "Search for" item on the context menu.
</p>
<p>
As has been the case for the last several releases, Mozilla includes full support for XML and CSS (and of course HTML). 
XSLT support is there too, but it's been quite buggy through 0.9.5, and probably still is. Don't be too surprised if you can't get this working. 
If you want to try, make sure you load both the XML documents and the XSLT stylesheets from a web server, not the local file system, and
that the server assigns both the  XML documents and the XSLT stylesheets 
the MIME media type text/xml.

Wizen Software has released 
<a href="http://www.wizen.com/content/intro.htm">PowerXML Pro 2.1</a>, a payware
"dynamic data-integration platform supporting information
exchange...between XML and non-XML data sources.
Sources include files, databases, applications, web-sites, mainframes,
and web-services. PowerXML is based on industry standard XML, XSLT, 
and XPath technologies."
This is a standalone desktop program for visually building
and executing dynamic data pipelines. Pipelines can be used to 
combine, filter, transform, and map data between various data sources
and formats.  The idea's interesting, but their web site just showed white pages on my Mac. Frankly, I'd be very hesitant to trust XML solutions to a company that hasn't even mastered HTML yet.

Pricing is not published, a fairly standard scam which different companies practice  for different purposes. Some vendors like to leave pricing unspecified so they can see how much they can milk out of customers, and not leave anything on the table.
Other vendors do have standard pricing, but like to make you invest a lot of time listening to their sales pitch  before they'll tell you what their product actually  costs.
That way they figure you'll be more invested in the product and less likely to 
rule it out immediately because it's overpriced. It's not clear which 
technique is in effect here.
Windows, NT/2000/XP, Linux, and Solaris are supported.

Republica Corp.
has submitted a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/NOTE-data-extraction-20011031">note</a>
to the W3C on the
DEL Data Extraction Language. According to the submission,
"DEL is an XML format for describing data conversion processes from other data formats to XML. A DEL script specifies how to locate and extract fragments from input data and where to insert them in the resulting XML format. The DEL processor executing the DEL script can use the extracted data to either create a new XML document or modify an existing XML document by creating new elements and attributes at locations specified with XPath expressions."
It's not clear if the W3C will do anything with this, but it looks interesting.

The W3C/IETF XML Digital Signature Working Group has posted a first and last call <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-xml-exc-c14n-20011120">working draft of Exclusive XML Canonicalization 1.0</a>.
Comments are due by December 11. Accordign to the abstract,
"Canonical XML [XML-C14N] recommends a standard means of serializing XML that, when applied to a subdocument, includes its namespace and some other XML context. However, for many applications, it is desirable to have a method which, to the extent practical, excludes such context from a canonicalized subdocument. In particular, where a digital signature over an XML subdocument is needed which will not break when that subdocument is removed from its original document and/or inserted into a different context. The Exclusive XML Canonicalization method described herein provides such a method."

I installed <a href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces-j/">Xerces-J 1.4.4</a> yesterday, and I'm not thrilled with it to say the least. This release  
did not fix several major, well-known bugs with SAX support. 
<code>XMLReaderFactory.createXMLReader()</code>  still fails to correctly load the Xerces <code>SAXParser</code> class, and the <code>AttributesImpl</code> class is out of date and has at least one nasty bug in <code>addAttribute()</code> that the current SAX distribution has fixed. 
(I haven't reported this one yet because I can't quite put my finger on the line of code that's ine rror; but I have proved to my satisfaction
that swapping the current SAX  <code>AttributesImpl</code>  class for the Xerces
 <code>AttributesImpl</code> class does fix the problem.)
Worse yet, the DOM code reintroduces a bug in <code>cloneNode()</code> (inability to clone documents) that had been fixed in Xerces-J 1.4.0.
Among other things, this breaks my <code><a href="XInclude/">DOMXIncluder</a></code>. I've downgraded to Xerces-J 1.4.3 for the moment.

The W3C has published a candidate recommendation of
<cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/CR-css3-selectors-20011113">Selectors</a></cite> (formerly CSS Selectors). 
"This document is one of the 'modules' of the upcoming CSS3 specification. It not only describes the selectors that already exist in CSS1 and CSS2, but also proposes new selectors for CSS3 as well as for other languages that may need them. The CSS Working Group doesn't expect that all implementations of CSS3 will have to implement all selectors. Instead, there will probably be a small number of variants of CSS3, so-called 'profiles'. For example, it may be that only a profile for non-interactive user agents will include all of the proposed selectors." There are a lot of new features here relative to CSS2, most importantly for XML namespace based selectors. 
Much of this material is discussed in Chapter 17 of the <cite><a href="books/biblegold/">XML Bible, Gold Edition</a></cite>.
The Candidate Recommendation Phase ends May, 2002.

The <a href="http://www.xmldb.org/xapi">XML:DB API</a> is an attempt to bring an ODBC or JDBC style access API to native XML databases.
The API is intended to be language independent, but most early work has been done in Java. 
The reference implementation is basically a very simple file system based native XML database and is an easy way to get familiar with the API. Full source code is available under an Apache style license.
Included with the reference implementation are some Java driver development tools, including a set of base driver classes and an early release of a test suite.
Java implementations of the XML:DB API exist for <a href="http://www.dbxml.org">dbXML</a> and <a href="http://exist.sourceforge.net">eXist</a>

and keyword search, Boolean operators, wildcard queries, numeric range queries
and stop word support are all available. Interfaces include XML over HTTP, a
Java API and SOAP 1.1. XYZFind Server currently ships on Linux, Solaris, and
Windows NT/2000/XP. XYZFind is very close-mouthed about what this actually costs, which I normally interpret as meaning "the price goes up or down depending on how much the salespeople think they can talk you into paying."

  This release "introduces a cheap-but-effective approximation to
  enforcement of the constraints on derivation by restriction for
  complex type definitions.  This works by enforcing the subset
  invariant, and rejects any content model for a type definition
  derived by restriction which allows anything _not_ allowed by the
  base type definition's content model.  This is slightly weaker than
  the REC: i.e. everything it rules out is ruled out by the REC, but a
  few things ruled out by the REC will not be caught."

One more chapter on SAX filters remains to be written.

Henry S. Thompson has released version 1.4 of the
 <a href="http://www.ltg.ed.ac.uk/~ht/xsv-status.html">XSV</a> W3C XML Schema Language validator.
  This release "introduces a cheap-but-effective approximation to
  enforcement of the constraints on derivation by restriction for
  complex type definitions.  This works by enforcing the subset
  invariant, and rejects any content model for a type definition
  derived by restriction which allows anything _not_ allowed by the
  base type definition's content model.  This is slightly weaker than
  the REC: i.e. everything it rules out is ruled out by the REC, but a
  few things ruled out by the REC will not be caught."
  XSV is published under the GPL.

I've posted the initial batch of web pages for the <cite><a href="books/biblegold/">XML Bible, Gold Edition</a></cite>.
The smaple chapters are pretty much the same ones from the 
second edition. The main new feature of interest here is the <a href="books/biblegold/source/">examples</a>, which 
cover several new topics including:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>DTD modularization</li>
	<li>XHTML 1.1</li>
	<li>SMIL 2.0</li>
	<li>XML Base</li>
	<li>Canonical XML</li>
	<li>RDDL</li>
</ul>

<p>
I was a bit bleary-eyed when I was putting these together last night, so there are doubtless a few broken links and missing examples. Please let me know of any you find so I can fix them. Thanks!

I've posted <cite><a href="books/xmljava/chapters/ch07.html">The XMLReader Interface</a></cite>, Chapter 7 of <cite>Processing XML with Java</cite>,
here on Cafe con Leche. This chapter covers:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Locating XML parsers with <code>XMLReaderFactory</code></li>
	<li>The different kinds of <code>SAXException</code></li>
	<li>Reading a document from an <code>InputSource</code></li>
	<li>Using <code>EntityResolver</code> to substitute DTD modules and other entities</li>
	<li>Reading DTDs with <code>DeclHandler</code></li>
	<li>Accessing unparsed entities and notations through <code>DTDHandler</code></li>
	<li>Lexical events reported by the <code>LexicalHandler</code></li>
	<li>Configuring the parser with features and properties</li>
</ul>

<p>
I've still got half the book to go, but I'd venture that this book is definitely starting to be seriously useful, and is a solid introduction to XML parsing for Java developers. In particular, 
It could certainly be used as a text for an XML course that focused on 
basic XML and SAX.
One more chapter on SAX filters remains to be written.
After that, it's on to DOM.

As readers of any of my XML books know, I have about three standard examples of processing instructions: php, cocoon, and robots. 
Thus I was a little disturbed to discover while working on an update yesterday that the original proposal for the
robots processing instruction by Walter Underwood (http://homepages.go.com/~wunder0/robots-pi.html) has vanished from the net. Furthermore, Mr. Underwood's old e-mail at wunder@infoseek.com is bouncing.
Walter, if you're out there could you please drop me an e-mail 
at <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;elharo%40metalab%2Eunc%2Eedu?Subject=robots">elharo@metalab.unc.edu</a>
with your current address? Or if anybody knows where I can reach him or where the robots page might have moved to, could you please let me know? 
I'd like to ask some questions about the current status and location of this proposal. 
Thanks.

<a href="http://www.xlinkit.com/download.html">xlinkit 4.3</a> has been released.  
xlinkit is a technology for expressing constraints between multiple
heterogeneous, distributed documents and data sources, based on XML.
xlinkit evaluates constraints and produces XLink hyperlinks between
inconsistent elements. 
Version 4.3 features a plug-in architecture for defining new operators
dynamically in Javascript to match even more heterogeneous
documents. Simple equality can become fuzzy equality or a regular
expression match, and entire subtree-equality can be checked in XML
documents. xlinkit is patented and <strong>not</strong> open source,
vendor claims to the contrary notwithstanding.

<dt><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-DOM-Level-3-XPath-20011031">Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 XPath Specification</a></dt>
<dd>
 This specification defines how one can extract node sets from a DOM Document using XPath 1.0 expressions. Like most everything else in DOM, the design is confusing and excessively complicated with multiple levels of indirection. The key interface is <code>XPathEvaluator</code>, which should give you the rough flavor of this API:

<pre><code>package org.w3c.dom.xpath;

public interface XPathEvaluator {
    public XPathExpression createExpression(String expression, 
                                            XPathNSResolver resolver)
                                            throws XPathException, DOMException;

    public XPathResult createResult();

    public XPathNSResolver createNSResolver(Node nodeResolver);

    public XPathResult evaluate(String expression, 
                                Node contextNode, 
                                XPathNSResolver resolver, 
                                short type, 
                                XPathResult result)

<dd>
The first part of this working draft defines how schemas in a variety of schema languages including DTDs and the W3C XML Schema Language can be represented in DOM.  This is a fairly major update. Among other changes, it adds datatype constants representing all of the W3C XML Schema Language predefined primitive data types. Unfortunately the API does not feel rich enough to support user-defined data types. I'm also concerned that the API only make this information available from the schema model and not from the document model.
That is, given an element declaration you can ask what type it has; but you can't ask the same question of an element instance.

The W3C has released the official <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xml-infoset-20011024/">XML Infoset Recommendation</a>. There do not appear to be any substantive changes since the proposed recommendation. 
This started out as a standard data model for all XML specifications, but got demoted to nothing more than a standard vocabulary for talking about XML.
It gives names for the different parts of an XML do (most of which already had names in XML 1.0 anyway). There's not a lot of practical information here.
The Infoset doesn't let you do anything you couldn't do before now. 
A few other specs such as XInclude are likely to be defined in terms of Infoset transformations instead of text document transformations, but that's about it.

The W3C has released version 5.2 of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/BinDist.html">Amaya</a> web browser for Unix and Windows. Amaya supports HTML 4.01, XHTML 1.0, XHTML Basic, XHTML 1.1, HTTP 1.1, MathML 2.0, much of
CSS Level 2, and some parts of SVG. It also includes an annotation application based on XPointer and RDF. 
It's not quite clear from the online documentation, but it looks probable that this release might add support for XML documents with CSS style sheets. I'm downloading it now to test that out. Update: XML files with attached CSS style sheets can be displayed directly in the browser. However, there are definitely some holes in CSS support.
</p>

<p>
In many ways, Amaya is a very nice browser/editor. 
However, the W3C mostly sees this as a test project, not as a serious end-user tool to compete with the likes of IE, Opera, and Mozilla.
Consequently, the user interface is ugly, and extremely quirky and non-standard.
I don't know how development on Amaya normally proceeds, but it might be worth somebody's time to do some work on the user interface, forking the project if necessary.

This release modularizes SVG 1.0 as well as adding a number of new elements and attributes.
One much needed feature under consideration for this release but not yet finished is  text wrapping. Other possibilities include
 allowing shapes to be described using viewport
          coordinates so that things like map legends could be statically placed

Sun's posted the <a href="http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/maintenance/jsr063/index.html">maintenance review draft specification of the
Java API for XML Processing 1.1</a>
in the Java Community Process. The goal for this release is to add standard schema support to JAXP by defining two new SAX properties,
http://java.sun.com/xml/jaxp/properties/schemaLanguage
and http://java.sun.com/xml/jaxp/properties/schemaLocation.
This seems like a reasonable proposal, though I'd prefer to see it done as a part of the next iteration of SAX rather than JAXP
(e.g. http://xml.org/sax/properties/schemaLanguage
and http://xml.org/sax/properties/schemaLocation). 
I also think they need a third http://java.sun.com/xml/jaxp/properties/noNamespaceSchemaLocation property.

here on Cafe con Leche. This chapter provides in-depth coverage of the <code>ContentHandler</code> interface, and discusses some common usage patterns for SAX.

all comments are appreciated. Just email them to me at <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;elharo%40metalab%2Eunc%2Eedu">elharo&#64;metalab&#46;unc&#46;edu</a>.
I have two questions in particular about this chapter.
First, is the sidebar on SAX in other languages (Python, Perl, C++) accurate?
I don't use these languages routinely, so it's entirely possible I've misrepresented the actual status of SAX in these environments.
Secondly, is SAXSpider, my example of the <code>Attributes</code> interface, too complex for an example at this level? Would a simpler example (say verifying all the URLs in an XHTML or RDDL document) make a better example of the <code>Attributes</code> interface?

The W3C has released the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xsl-20011015/">1.0 Recommendation of 
XSL Formatting Objects</a> (<acronym title="XSL Formatting Objects">XSL-FO</acronym>).
<acronym title="XSL Formatting Objects">XSL-FO</acronym> is a page description language like PostScript
written as an XML application.
The normal use scenario is that you write an XSLT stylesheet
that transforms an input XML document into an <acronym title="XSL Formatting Objects">XSL-FO</acronym> document.
The <acronym title="XSL Formatting Objects">XSL-FO</acronym> document describes how content should
                               be styled, laid out, and paginated.
You would then convert the <acronym title="XSL Formatting Objects">XSL-FO</acronym> document into a more convenient format such as PDF, PostScript. or TeX, from whence it could be viewed or printed on paper.
</p>

<p>
The spec lists the
following changes since the Proposed Recommendation:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>"visibility" has been added to the properties applicable to
fo:table-row, fo:table-header, fo:table-footer, fo:table-body.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"inline-progression-dimension" has been added to the
properties applicable to fo:table-cell.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"clip" has been added to the properties applicable
to fo:external-graphic and fo:instream-foreign-object.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The initial value of "white-space-treatment" has been changed
to "ignore-if-surrounding-linefeed" and the expansion of "white-space"
for the values "normal" and "nowrap" has been changed to the same
value.
</p>
</li>


<li>
<p>Space-resolution rules modified so that line-area spaces
do not merge with other kinds of spaces.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fo:table-cell: an implementation may recover from the border
resolution error condition in the "collapse-with-precedence" case
by selecting one of the borders.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"border-after-precedence", "border-before-precedence",
"border-end-precedence", and "border-start-precedence" have been
added to the properties applicable to
fo:table-column. The initial values of these properties have been
changed to reflect this.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The rectangle used for percentage calculations changed for
the "extent" property.
</p>
</li>

XInclude.net (whoever that is) has published a GPL'd
<a href="http://xinclude.net">XInclude implementation for the Microsoft XML
Parser</a>. At first glance, it looks roughly equivalent to my XInclude processor for Java; i.e. it
can include complete documents but not parts thereof because it does not support XPointer.
There are some conformance bugs in the XInclude.net program, but they're not too large.

The problems I noted with the Macintosh version of Mozilla
on Friday (complete failure to display almost all Web pages)
appear to have been a conflict with Steve Falkenburg's <a href="http://www.falken.net/webfree/">WebFree</a>,
a shareware control panel that filters ads. 
Disabling it restored Mozilla, and also fixed some problems I had selecting text in Netscape 4.7. Furthermore, Netscape used to fall apart once I opened more than a dozen or so simultaneous windows, and it hasn't done that since I turned off WebFree. 
</p>

<p>
WebFree hasn't been updated in four years. I certainly hope it will get an update soon. Since I started using it, it's blocked over 10,000 ads. When I turned it off I was amazed at how ugly and annoying a lot of my favorite web sites suddenly became. Still, if WebFree is destabilizing my system, then it's got to go. It's time to start looking for alternative ad blocking software.
Fortunately Mozilla itself now can block pop-up windows, though not yet inline ads.

 except
                            MailNews. </p></li>
<li><p>A new Site Navigation Bar for navigating sites that use the LINK element (like
                            Bugzilla buglists.) Choose the menu item View | Show/Hide | Site Navigation bar | Show As Only
                            Needed to make the toolbar show up automatically when you visit pages that use the LINK

Mozilla has been my default browser on Windows and Linux for several months now,
with only occasional crashes and a few minor cosmetic glitches, particularly involving lists. However, in 0.9.4 the Mac version was completely non-functional. Hopefully, that's improved in 0.9.5. I'm downloading it now and I'll  let you know.

<img src="covers/biblegoldcovermedium.jpg" align="left"
alt="Cover of the XML Bible, Gold Edition" width="224" height="300" hspace="5" vspace="5"><p>
I'm pleased to announce the release of the <cite>XML Bible, Gold Edition</cite>.
At just barely under 1600 pages, this is my largest book yet, and possibly the largest XML book published to-date. 
In fact, I wrote more pages than the printer could glue between two covers, so  this edition is also my first English language hard back.
Why so big? Because I needed to fit in everything that was in the second edition plus oodles of new and updated material including:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>RDDL</li>
	<li>XInclude</li>
	<li>XML Base</li>
	<li>Canonical XML</li>
	<li>Modular XHTML</li>
	<li>DTD Modularization</li>
	<li>SMIL</li>
	<li>CSS Level 3</li>
</ul>

<p>
In addition, the treatment of several existing topics was expanded and/or updated significantly including schemas, XSL Formatting Objects, and the design of XML applications. The <cite>XML Bible, Gold Edition</cite> has arrived at pretty much all bookstores that carry computer books including 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0764548190/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/">Amazon</a>, <a href="http://www1.fatbrain.com/asp/bookinfo/bookinfo.asp?theisbn=0764548190&amp;vm=">FatBrain</a>, and <a href="http://shop.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0764548190">Barnes &amp; Noble</a>.
The list price is  $69.99, though most stores are offering their usual discounts.
If you need to special order it, the ISBN number is 0-7645-4819-0, and it's written by me, Elliotte Rusty Harold. I'll get the web pages for the Gold edition online here at Cafe con Leche soon, but in the meantime the <a href="books/bible2/chapters/">sample chapters</a> from the second edition are pretty much what's been printed in the Gold edition. In fact, the updated schemas chapter I've posted here was actually taken from the manuscript for the Gold edition. 
</p>

<p>
The plan is to keep selling both the second and gold editions simultaneously
which raises the obvious question of which you should buy. On the down side, the Gold edition
costs $20 more, and is about 2 pounds heavier.  If you're strapped for cash or bookshelf space, you should probably choose the second edition. On the upside, the Gold edition is a little more up-to-date. If you have a particular interest in any of the new topics listed above or schemas, I'd suggest getting the Gold edition. Otherwise the second edition will probably serve you well
without inducing a hernia. 
</p>

<p>
For this edition, I focused on adding new material, not on rewriting and updating what had already been written. 
If you already own the second edition, it's probably not worth upgrading unless you have a particular need for one of the new chapters. It's only been about 5 months since the second edition came out, and pretty much everything in that edition is still current.
On the other hand, if you're still using the first edition, it might be time to upgrade. The first edition is now over two years old, and there've been a lot of developments in the XML world since 1999. I'm sorry but there's no special upgrade price. Unlike software, the incremental cost of printing extra copies
of a book is a non-trivial. However, if you did like the first edition, I think you'll like the Gold edition even more.

The W3C XML Protocol Working Group has posted two new working drafts
for SOAP,
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-soap12-part1-20011002/"><cite>SOAP Version 1.2 Part 1: Messaging Framework</cite></a>
and <cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-soap12-part2-20011002/">SOAP Version 1.2 Part 2: Adjuncts</a></cite>.
Previously this was a single monolithic document.
Part 1  describes the SOAP envelope and SOAP transport binding framework.
 Part 2 describes the SOAP encoding rules, the SOAP remote procedure call (RPC) convention, and a concrete HTTP binding.
I haven't read the entire specs yet, but I do notice that
SOAP is still using local, unqualified child  elements in the 
fault codes. Could somebody please fix this brain damage before it spreads?
Thanks. There's really no reason not to put all SOAP defined elements in the
appropriate SOAP namespace.

Software Development 2002 West is being held April 22-26 in San Jose, California, 
and I have once again signed on to chair the XML track. 
The  <a href="http://www.sdexpo.com/2002/west/speakers/abstracts.htm">call for papers</a> to anybody who'd like to participate in the XML or any other track.
</p>

<p>
The audience at this show
consists primarily of working programmers with a bias toward Java and C++, mostly on the Windows platform though Unix/Linux is well represented as well. At East this year, I noticed a lot of interest in .Net; and there's a .Net track at West as well, so we're definitely interested in presentations about XML in the .Net environment (and other things in .Net as well, though I'm not personally responsible for that). Web services is a big focus as well, though again that goes in a separate track that I'm not responsible for. 
</p>

<p>
When it comes to XML, we find that our attendees really like introductory tutorial sessions. For example a tutorial on the W3C XML Schema Language that covered the basics and assumed no prior experience with schemas would be useful. An advanced session on schema best practices, however, would probably not be of interest to most of our attendees and might be better saved for one of the XML-specific conferences like XMLOne or XML 2001. At this stage it is OK to assume basic knowledge of XML, well-formedness, and DTDs. You do not need to begin your talks with "this is what a tag is", "this is what an attribute is", etc.
</p>

<p>
Most sessions at SD are 90 minutes. We also have room for a few full-day tutorials. However, for these we prefer speakers who have a good track record presenting at previous SD conferences, so if this is your first time with us, it would be better to submit proposals for 90-minute seminars. We're also accepting proposals for BOFs, panels, and similar events.  
If you're interested, please fill out the form at <a href="http://www.sdexpo.com/2002/west/speakers/abstracts.htm">http://www.sdexpo.com/2002/west/speakers/abstracts.htm</a>

of RDF Model Theory</a>. According to the abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
This is a specification of a model-theoretic semantics for RDF and
RDFS, and some basic results on entailment. It does not cover
reification or special meanings associated with the use of RDF
containers. This document was written with the intention of providing a
precise semantic theory for RDF and RDFS, and to sharpen the notions of
consequence and inference in RDF. It reflects the current understanding
of the RDF Core working group at the time of writing. In some
particulars this differs from the account given in Resource Description
Framework (RDF) Model and Syntax Specification, and these exceptions are
noted. 
</blockquote>

<p>
Honestly, I didn't understand half of this document, which is full of references to things like the "Strong Herbrand Lemma" and "N-triples syntax".
Still, if you're a mathematician who specializes in graph theory, you might find this amusing. 
The word of the day is "skolemization". Just don't ask me to explain what it means. :-)

The W3C XML Schema Working Group has published an updated working draft draft of

 <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-xmlschema-formal-20010925/">XML Schema: Formal Description</a>. According to section 1,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
This formalization is a formal, declarative system for describing and naming XML Schema information,
          specifying XML instance type information, and validating instances against schemas. The goals of the
          formalization are to: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>                Provide a semantic framework for software systems that use the W3C XML Schema specification, such as the W3C XML Query Algebra. </li>
	<li>                Specify names for all components of an XML Schema, so that they can be uniquely identified by URIs. Such unique identifiers may be useful to XML Query, RDF, and topic maps, among others. </li>
	<li>                Formally define validation at a declarative level. </li>
	<li>                Define the mapping from the current XML Schema syntax onto the structures described here, as well as the mapping between the XML Schema component mode and our component model. </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
If you're of the opinion that this might have been a good thing to do
<em>before</em> the schema speicifcation was finished, well, let's just say you're not alone.

I've posted version 1.0d8 of my <a href="XInclude/">XInclude processors for DOM, SAX, and JDOM</a>.
The only API change is that the XIncluder class for JDOM is now named
<code>JDOMXIncluder</code> to parallel <code>SAXXIncluder</code> and <code>DOMXIncluder</code>.
It was originally just called <code>XIncluder</code> because it was the first one I wrote, but I'll probably use that name for a generic driver that uses a command line argument to select which API to use. 
Internally, the major change in this release is that I've now implemented 
substantially better heuristics for correctly detecting the encoding of text 
files included with <code>parse="text"</code>.

The W3C Device Independence Activity has published its <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-di-princ-20010918/">first public working draft, <cite>Device Independence Principles</cite></a>. According to the abstract, "This document celebrates the vision of a device independent Web. It describes device independence
          principles that can lead towards the achievement of greater device independence for Web content and
          applications." The goal is to allow web pages to be presented not just to different Web browsers, but to telephones, PDAs, kiosks, digital paper, 
fax machines, televisions,
and other radically different hardware.

The W3C/IETF joint URI Planning Interest Group has published t
a note on
<cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/NOTE-uri-clarification-20010921/">URIs, URLs, and URNs: Clarifications and Recommendations</a></cite>. According to the abstract:
</p>

<blockquote>
This paper addresses and attempts to clarify two issues pertaining to
URIs, and presents recommendations. Section 1 addresses how URI space is
partitioned and the relationship between URIs, URLs, and URNs. Section 2
describes how URI schemes and URN namespace ids are registered. Section
3 mentions additional unresolved issues not considered by this paper and
section 4 presents recommendations.
</blockquote>

<p>
It makes interesting reading. I recommend it for anyone who's ever
been confused about the difference between URLs, URIs, and URNs, and 
exactly what makes a legal URI anyway.

The W3C  User Agent Accessibility Guidelines Working Group  has posted the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/CR-UAAG10-20010912/">candidate recommendation of
User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0</a>. According to the abstract:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
This document provides guidelines for designing user agents that lower barriers to Web accessibility for
          people with disabilities (visual, hearing, physical, and cognitive). User agents include HTML browsers and
          other types of software that retrieve and render Web content. A user agent that conforms to these
          guidelines will promote accessibility through its own user interface and through other internal facilities,
          including its ability to communicate with other technologies (especially assistive technologies).
          Furthermore, all users, not just users with disabilities, are expected to find conforming user agents to be
          more usable.
</p>

<p>
          In addition to helping developers of HTML browsers, media players, etc., this document will also benefit
          developers of assistive technologies because it explains what types of information and control an assistive
          technology may expect from a conforming user agent. Technologies not addressed directly by this document
          (e.g., technologies for braille rendering) will be essential to ensuring Web access for some users with
          disabilities.

I've returned from XMLOne Amsterdam. Several speakers couldn't make it

Michael Kay's released version 6.4.4 of his

This release fixes 13 bugs, updates Saxon to work with FOP 0.20.1 and JDOM 0.7,

The W3C XML Core working group has published a new working draft of the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-xml-blueberry-req-20010921">XML Blueberry Requirements</a>. 
This document proposes a new, incompatible version of XML that allows characters introduced in Unicode 3.0 and later to be used in element and attribute names.
(They can already be used in character data.) Furthermore, it intends to allow the use of certain mainframe line ending control characters in tag white space as well.
</p>

<p>
There are no significant changes in this draft. The real purpose of this draft seems to more clearly express the working group's motivation that
"Discriminating against languages simply because their scripts were not encoded in Unicode 2.0 is inherently unjust." The working group continues to ignore
the costs this will impose on the existing XML community, and
indeed considers any cost-benefit analysis to be immoral. 
</p>

<p> Numerous objections that were raised against the earlier draft set
of requirements remain unanswered, including:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Native language markup is not considered as a separate issue from
	    supporting non-standard mainframe line-ending conventions.</li>
	<li>There's no requirement specifying that they should make only the minimum changes necessary to meet their goals. </li>
	<li>There's no requirement specifying that every effort should be made to insure that any document that does not need to use Blueberry does not use Blueberry. </li>
</ul>

<p>
The working group is pretending that this is 1995, that nobody has any investment in the existing infrastructure, and that anything less than the best solution imaginable today in 2001 is unjust and unacceptable. But it's not 1995. People do have huge investments in the existing XML syntax. Changing it now has real costs that will harm real people. 
The working group refuses to  even  consider these costs or to tally up the benefits expected 
and compare them to the costs. They have decided that this will be done and that no justification is necessary.

The XML Linking Working Group has published a new <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/CR-xptr-20010911/">Candidate Recommendation of XPointer</a>. At first glance, the XPointer syntax and semnatics does not seem to have changed. However, the specification document has been cleaned up, and some points have been clarified, though you still have to read between the lines to figure out how to write an XPointer that selects a point.

I've posted <a href="books/xmljava/chapters/ch05.html">Reading XML</a>, Chapter 5 of <cite>Processing XML with Java</cite>. This chapter is a broad overview of the various parsers and APIs available for processing XML documents.
It provides example of DOM, SAX, JDOM, dom4j, and ElectricXML and discusses
the relative advantages and disadvantages of each. SAX and DOM will definitely
be covered in more detail in future chapters. 
</p>

<p>
The coverage of dom4j and ElectricXML was directly inspired by comments 
from Cafe con Leche readers I received on earlier chapters. After exploring  these APIs in more detail, I found some major design flaws in ElectricXML so it probably
won't be covered past this chapter. dom4j actually looks pretty well designed though, and may be the best of the non-standard APIs. I need to try it on a tougher problem like my <a href="XInclude/">XInclude  processor</a> and see how it holds up. I'm also debating whether I should add a section to this chapter on <a href="http://kxml.enhydra.org">kXML</a>, a parser that doesn't implement any of the standard APIs but will run in J2ME environments.

My Speakeasy DSL went down yesterday afternoon

Apparently a backup generator overheated, and nobody can get to the site to

Altova's released version 4.0 of <a href="http://www.xmlspy.com/">XML Spy</a>,
their popular $399 payware XML editor. 
New features include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Improved support for the final XML Schema Recommendation including
  <code>fixed</code>, <code>redefine</code>,
<code>abstract</code>, <code>nillable</code>, and <code>xsi:nil</code>
  </li>
  <li>Automatical conversion of schemas from the April 7 working draft or October
24 Candidate Recommendation to the final  version</li>
<li>Conversion of DTDs, XML-Data, and BizTalk schemas to
the W3C XML Schema Language</li>
<li> Complete support for Undo in the XSLT Designer</li>
<li>More online help</li>
<li>A new license manager</li>
<li>The XML Spy 4.0 Document
Framework that  "provides the customer with a highly user-friendly
interface - very much like a typical word processor - that allows for true
XML content editing and creation."</li>
<li>The XML Spy 4.0 XSLT Designer, a graphical XSLT stylesheet creation tool that
enables the customization of the document editor by defining an XSLT
Stylesheet and additional editing-specific options based upon the underlying
DTD or XML Schema for use during the content creation or editing process.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I tested the last public beta of this release and  was not impressed. It
was agonizingly  slow when loading and saving files, probably because it
insisted on validating before it did either one. Neither the Document
Framework nor the XSLT Designer actually worked on the Docbook documents
and stylesheets I tested them with, and I've seen reports that this is
still true in the final release version. If you're using XML Spy 3.5, I
reocmmend you don't upgrade until at least the next bug fix release. If
you're not using XML Spy, I recommend you stick with whatever you are
using until at least the next major release.

<p>
I'm still feeling a little shocked from the bombings yesterday.
The magnitude of this is still seeping in. Personally, I feel quite fortunate.
So far all my friends, family, and colleagues seem to have come through OK.
There's still one person I need to check on.  (Update: I got in touch with her this afternoon and she's fine.) For those of you who aren't New Yorkers, just know that a lot of people worked in the towers at all levels 
from CEO to janitor. Everyone in New York knows someone who worked there, often many people. This attack really cuts across all levels of the city.
As somebody (I forget who. It might have been Giuliani.) said on the news last night, this attack did not single out whites or blacks or Jews or Arabs or Christians or Muslims or Chinese or police officers or civilians or citizens or foreign nationals or immigrants or any other group. This was an attack on all of us. 
</p>

<p>
This has been the main topic of discussion on many of the mailing lists I participate in, with topics ranging from XML to Unicode to computer book publishing.  None of these are political lists. Mostly the list moms seem to be willing to let the discussion flow without worrying too much about how off-topic it is. That's important in times like this. Sentiment seems to be divided about 50-50 between the 
"Let's get revenge and bomb somebody, even if we aren't sure exactly who"
and "Let's focus on catching the criminals, and try to understand 
why this happened." Private e-mail about my comments yesterday
is about equally divided. 
</p>

<p>
I wish I could say that the television media showed an equal diversity of opinion, but I'm afraid that's not true. CNN, CBS, and the local stations would only interview the same white war mongers 
and law enforcement agents 
who kept insisting that we needed to start bombing people before we even knew who was responsible, that we needed to repeal the restriction against assassination (James Baker), and that we were going to have to give up our civil liberties. Dissenting voices like Noam Chomsky, Howard Zinn, or Norman Siegel
were even more absent from the air waves than they normally are.
</p>

<p>
I finally found some intelligent rational discussion on Channel 54,
BET. They were interviewing Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson Sr., and others who had a much more cautious view. It was the only place in the mass media where I saw any recognition that there were likely reasons this attack occurred, and that we needed to address the root causes as much as the symptoms. 
It was one of the few places on TV I saw any concern for avoiding civilian casualties in the inevitable retaliation for this attack. 
The white mass media likes to portray people like Sharpton and Jackson as fringe nutcases. What was apparent last night was that the fringe is a lot more  reasoned, informed, and honest than the mainstream. If either of them runs for anything again, they've got my vote. We need more people like this. 
</p>

<p>
I promise I'll get back to Java and XML tomorrow. Right now I'm just having a
little trouble focussing on such things. 
</p>

 </dd>
 
	<dt id="news2001September11">Tuesday, September 11, 2001</dt><dd>


<p>
I'm continuing to watch the spin about the attacks today.
The level of racism and Anti-Arab hysteria seems to be rising slowly through the day, though there's still no evidence of the race or nationality of the 
criminals. And of course even if it does turn out that the terrorists were in fact Arabs, that's no justification for retaliatory attacks against
Arab countries and civilians. 
</p>

<p>
Many people are calling this an act of war and comparing it to Pearl Harbor.
In reality, this isn't even close. Pearl Harbor was a deliberate attack by 
the military forces of a hostile nation. In all likelihood, no nation and no government was behind this assault. That of course, is what terrorism means:
a violent assault by non-government individuals and groups for political purposes. When nations commit violent assaults against civilian populations,
it's not called terrorism even though the effects are much worse.
</p>


<p>
I'm also hearing a lot of talking heads from the FBI and other law enforcement agencies
 blaming this attack on the openness of our society,
our rights, and our civil liberties. Of course the obvious implication is that we need to reduce these and unleash law enforcement to combat attacks like today's. In truth, of course, a police state would have done nothing to prevent today's attacks or one in the future. 
</p>

<p>
I've also watched pictures on the news of  Palestinians
celebrating in the street. A few people have expressed concern that
Americans are hated around the world, and that consequently we need to beef up our defenses. Nobody seems willing to ask the question of why we're so hated 
that school children are celebrating the violent murder of thousands of people. 
The answer, of course, is that while what happened today is completely 
new to the American experience, it's not at all new in many other 
places around the globe. In Palestine, in particular, the people have been
brutally assaulted and murdered by terrorist planes for decades. 
Many of those planes are American made and/or paid for with American dollars.
The attacks today may or may not have been retribution for the decades of oppression of Palestinian people, but we should not be particularly surprised that the oppressed take a little glee in a successful attack on a previously invulnerable oppressor.  
</p>

<p>
The real solution cannot be found in retaliation. Violence only begets more violence. While I hope that any living collaborators in this attack are captured and severely punished, I see no point in going to war against Palestine,
Afghanistan, or anyone else. Terrorist actions of this nature are inevitable as long as the United States persists in its decades long suppression
of legitimate aspirations for self-rule around the world. This is nothing new. The U.S. actively backed repressive client states in Greece, in Italy, in Guatemala, in Nicaragua, in El Salvador, in Vietnam, in the Philippines, in Iraq, in Iran, in Palestine, and many other places. The only thing that surprises me is that it's taken this long for responses on our home soil
to reach this magnitude. Until the U.S. is willing to honestly address why we're hated, no security measures will be sufficient. 
</p>

<hr />
<p>
Update: after a few hours of watching the coverage on the news and listening to people on various mailing lists, mostly New York local, it seems increasingly probable that we're going to go to war with somebody even if the country we're attacking had nothing to do with the attack. The most likely target of opportunity seems to be Afghanistan. Based on past experience, there probably won't be any real war, just a bunch of planes dropping bombs from a couple of miles up. 
This would solve nothing. 
That a few idiots without government support killed possibly hundreds of American civilians is not an excuse for us to retaliate by killing several
hundred civilians in their country who had equally little to do with this. 
</p>
<hr />
<p>
I'm sitting here in New York switching between CNN and local channels.
I just saw the second tower of the World Trade Center go down.
This is truly horrible. I know many people who work there. I'm hoping they're alright.
I think there was a Sun office there, although I don't remember off the top of my head whether it was in one of the towers or one of the three smaller buildings. It might even have been a local Sun reseller.
One of the local user groups had  meetings there, though I 
stopped attending after the security screening refused me admission one night
because I wasn't on the list of attendees. 
Either way, I hope everyone got out. 
The attack happened relatively early in the morning on an election day here in New York so maybe the buildings weren't as full as they might have been. 
We can only hope. (I just heard the election has been postponed.)
</p>

<p>
So far the coverage I've seen has been relatively restrained.
Oklahoma City taught most networks that they couldn't automatically 
blame the Arabs for every terrorist attack. Maybe some politicians learned their lessons too and we won't hear the calls for immediate retaliation against some target before we even know whose responsible for this horror. 
</p>

<p>
Longer term there are going to be a lot of calls for 
higher security measures at airports, restricting travel from 
unfriendly nations, more surveillance cameras, and various other
Big Brother measures. It's important to
remember that none of these did any good today. 
After the last bombing, 
the World Trade Center had some of the tightest security 
of any general office building in New York; and it didn't help.
We don't know yet what happened at the airports where the planes left, but 
all the requirements that people show ID and go through various security checkpoints didn't stop this either.  
</p>

<p>
Whoever was immediately responsible for this atrocity is undoubtedly dead
along with any passengers who may have been on the planes. We may never know their names, and we certainly won't be able to exact vengeance on them.
I'm also afraid though that somebody's going to be brought to trials for this, whether they're actually responsible or not. If we can indeed find the murderers
responsible for this act, then they deserve to be put in prison for
the rest of their natural lives. However, I'm very worried that the government  can't find the people responsible, then they'll find somebody anyway,
no matter how tangential their connection to the actual bombers.
We have to be wary of show trials designed to do nothing more than 
assuage our desire to make someone pay.

The W3C HTML Activity.
has posted a new <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-xforms-20010828/">working draft of the XForms 1.0 specification</a>.
This describes the "next generation of web forms".
Today's HTML forms don't distinguish between
  the purpose and the presentation of a form.
   XForms, by contrast, have separate sections that describe what the form does  and how the form looks, thus making XForms more suitable for a broad range of media from web browsers to cell phones.
The XForms themselves and the data collected in an XForm and returned to a server
are all written in XML.
An XForms Submit Protocol defines how XForms send and receive data,
including the ability to suspend and resume the completion of a form.
The changes in this draft  are too numerous to list here, but are nicely summarized in an <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xforms/sliceD.html">appendix</a> to this draft.

The W3C Web Accessibility Initiative 
Protocols and Formats Working Group  has published
a working draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-xmlgl-20010829">XML Accessibility Guidelines</a>. From the abstract:
</p>

<blockquote>
This document explains how to design accessible applications using XML,
the Extensible Markup Language. Compared to the HTML or MathML
languages, XML is one level up: it is a meta syntax used to describe
these languages, as well as new ones. As a meta syntax, XML provides no

Registration is  required to download the beta
and beta testers should not expect a free copy when the product is released.
New features include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Improved support for the final XML Schema Recommendation including
  <code>fixed</code>, <code>redefine</code>,
<code>abstract</code>, <code>nillable</code>, and <code>xsi:nil</code>
  </li>
  <li>Automatical conversion of schemas from the April 7 working draft or October
24 Candidate Recommendation to the final  version</li>
<li>Conversion of DTDs, XML-Data, and BizTalk schemas to
the W3C XML Schema Language</li>
<li> Complete support for Undo in the XSLT Designer</li>
<li>More online help</li>
<li>A new license manager</li>
<li>The XML Spy 4.0 Document
Framework that  "provides the customer with a highly user-friendly
interface - very much like a typical word processor - that allows for true
XML content editing and creation."</li>
<li>The XML Spy 4.0 XSLT Designer, a graphical XSLT stylesheet creation tool that
enables the customization of the document editor by defining an XSLT
Stylesheet and additional editing-specific options based upon the underlying
DTD or XML Schema for use during the content creation or editing process.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is the first version of XML Spy I've tried in a while, and overall I was not impressed. It was agonizingly  slow  when loading and saving files,
probably because it insisted on validating before it did either one.
Neither the Document
Framework nor the XSLT Designer actually worked on the Docbook
documents and stylesheets I tested them with. Maybe they'd work with simpler,
less complex documents. Perhaps this will get fixed in the next release, but 
XMLSpy still seems substantially more difficult to use than a simple text editor like <a href="http://www.jedit.org/">jEdit</a>.

<p>
I've now successfully installed Internet Explorer 6
on my NT box and have been able to check out its support for XML
(or lack thereof). I've also received a number of reports from readers.
</p>

<p>
First the good news: IE6 does seem to support XSLT 1.0. I haven't run it through 
extensive testing but it did correctly render all the simple XML + XSLT 1.0 examples I took from the <cite>XML Bible 2nd edition</cite>. It does recognize the
http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform namespace. This is about two years too late, but better late than never.
</p>

<p>
Now for the bad news (and there's a lot of it):
</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>At first glance, CSS support for XML does not seem to be significantly improved. For instance, <code>display: table</code> is still not supported.</p></li>

	<li><p>Microsoft still labors under the illusion that there is a MIME media  type text/xsl. IE does not recognize the actual MIME types
text/xml and application/xml+xslt as identifying XSL stylesheets.</p></li>

	<li><p>The XML parser built-in to IE is thoroughly broken.
	It accepts some malformed documents as well-formed.
	It rejects many real-world well-formed and even valid XML documents
	as malformed, most embarrassingly the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-xml-19980210.xml">first edition of the
	XML 1.0 specification</a> itself. 
	</p></li>

</ul>

<p>
Bottom line: any doubt that the IE team at Microsoft actually cares about standards has been erased. 
More than three years since XML 1.0 was released and almost two years after XSLT 1.0 was released, IE still does not correctly implement these specifications.
Even though the XML parser group at Microsoft provided the IE
group with a relatively standards conformant XML parser/XSLT processor,
the IE programmers deliberately chose to cripple it rather than
support standard XML!</p>

<p>
The excuses that the IE team simply made a mistake in interpreting the spec, 
or that
their software shipped before the specs were finished are no longer tenable.
The only reasonable interpretation of Microsoft's actions is that
the IE developers believe it's more important to maintain compatibility with broken, beta, Microsoft proprietary experiments than 
to support proven, reliable, standard specifications. They do not exist in a 
culture that rewards compliance with specifications. At most they care about compatibility with other Microsoft software. They  are simply not willing to expend any effort to improve compatibility with the rest of the world. 
In the future, one must assume that Microsoft will implement only those parts
of XML specification that they like, and that they will change. modify, extend, and break those parts of the specs they don't like. Conformance to
standards is simply not a virtue in the Microsoft world.

The W3C has formed the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/WebOnt/charter">Web Ontology Working Group</a>, part of the Semantic Web Activity, to develop a language that extends
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the semantic reach of current XML and RDF
meta-data efforts. In particular, in a recent talk on the Semantic Web, Tim
Berners-Lee, Director of the W3C, outlined the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/2000/Talks/1206-xml2k-tbl/slide10-0.html">necessary
layers</a> for developing applications that depend on an understanding of
logical content, not just human-readable presentation. This working group
will focus on building the ontological layer and the formal underpinnings
thereof.</p>

<p>Such language layers are crucial to the emerging Semantic Web, as they
allow the explicit representation of term vocabularies and the relationships
between entities in these vocabularies. In this way, they go beyond XML, RDF
and RDF-S in allowing greater machine readable content on the web. A further
necessity is for such languages to be based on a clear semantics
(denotational and/or axiomatic) to allow tool developers and language
designers to unambiguously specify the expected meaning of the semantic
content when rendered in the Web Ontology syntax.</p>

<p>Specifically, the Web Ontology Working Group is chartered to design the
following component:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>A Web ontology language, that builds on current Web languages that
    allow the specification of classes and subclasses, properties and
    subproperties (such as RDFS), but which extends these constructs to allow
    more complex relationships between entities including: means to limit the
    properties of classes with respect to number and type, means to infer
    that items with various properties are members of a particular class, a
    well-defined model of property inheritance, and similar semantic
    extensions to the base languages. 
    <p>The <a href="http://www.daml.org/2001/03/daml+oil-index.html">March
    2001 DAML+OIL specification</a>, discussed in some detail in section <a
    href="#L398">1.1 below</a> serves as an example of an ontology language -
    a <a href="http://www.daml.org/language/features.html">comparison of
    DAML+OIL to XML, XML-schema, and RDF-Schema</a> is available.</p>

Microsoft's released <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.htm">Internet Explorer 6.0 for Windows</a>.
I haven't tried it yet. Would anyone care to comment, particularly
on its XML and XSLT support? Does it finally support XSLT 1.0 in its default installation? Does it actually recognize the correct MIME media type (text/xml) 
for XSLT style sheets?  And is CSS support improved to the level currently 
available in Mozilla and Opera? 
</p>

<p>
Update: the first responses are coming in and it seems that Microsoft has once again deliberately chosen not to conform to XML 1.0. IE6 does use MSXML3, but it instantiates it in a "backward compatibilty mode" where
it inherits MSXML's bugs including not recognizing character references
after &amp;#xFFFF; and allowing the illegal C0 control characters such as
null and vertical tab.  I'm still waiting to hear whether they support XSLT 1.0
or not.

I'm back from Vermont, Boston, and the Software Development 2001 East show.
The show was a little smaller this year following the dot-bomb, and some of the classes had very small audiences; but
overall it was still a good time, and there were a few interesting developments.
</p>

<p>
Howard Katz clued me into <a href="http://www.softwareag.com/developer/quip/">Quip</a>,
a free-beer implementation of the XML Query Language
from Software AG. It can query against the Tamino database or a local collection of 
XML documents. I'll probably demo this in my Cutting Edge XML Programming session at XMLOne Amsterdam in a couple of weeks. The current version is 1.5.1.
</p>

<p>
I also spent a lot of time working on my <a href="XInclude/">XInclude processors</a> at the show.
Nothing  like having to give a demo of a product to inspire you to finish it up.
I fixed some serious bugs in the SAX <code>XIncludeFilter</code>
and added support for the detecting the encoding of text files to
all three versions (SAX, DOM, and JDOM). I also improved the error reporting 
and handling across the package. All users should upgrade.
</p>

<p>
Of course as always seems to happen, in the course of implementing the 
"last feature" I noticed several things I hadn't seen before in the specification. The big ones related to XInclude's usage of the infoset,
particularly unparsed entity and notation information items.
If an XInclude processor is required to pass these along,
then it's basically impossible to implement XInclude fully
in either DOM or JDOM, because they don't expose these properties
in the necessary places.  SAX can do it, but not in a streaming fashion.
In essence, handling XInclude requires you to build your own infoset compatible,
XPointer addressable, tree-model for an XML document. Yuck. 
I'm hopeful that this is a result of an unclear specification document rather than the actual intent of the working group. 
</p>


<p>
However, if it does turn out that full infoset support is required for
XInclude handling, Lynda van Vleet and Kirill Gavrylyuk's presentation
to me suggested an interesting approach. 
For the OASIS XSLT conformance testing project, they've defined an XML serialization of the infoset which is not, as you might think, the original XML document.
For example, suppose the original XML document 
looks like this:
</p>


<pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0"?>
&lt;!-- Simple XML Document -->
&lt;msg:message msg:date="19990421"
       xmlns:msg="http://message.example.org/"
>Phone home!&lt;/msg:message>
</code></pre>

<p>Then its infoset serialization looks like this: </p>

<pre><code>&lt;document>
  &lt;children>
    &lt;comment>
      &lt;content>Simple XML Document&lt;content>
    &lt;/comment>
    &lt;element>
      &lt;namespaceName>http://message.example.org/&lt;/namespaceName>
      &lt;localName>message&lt;/localName>
      &lt;children>
	    &lt;text>Phone Home!&lt;/text>
      &lt;/children>
      &lt;attributes>
        &lt;attribute>
          &lt;namespaceName>http://message.example.org/&lt;/namespaceName>
          &lt;localName>date&lt;/localName>
          &lt;normalizedValue>19990421&lt;/normalizedValue>
          &lt;attributeType>CDATA&lt;/attributeType>
          &lt;specified>true&lt;/specified>
        &lt;/attribute>
      &lt;/attributes>
      &lt;inScopeNamespaces>
        &lt;namespace>
          &lt;prefix>msg&lt;/prefix>
          &lt;namespaceName>http://message.example.org/&lt;/namespaceName>
        &lt;/namespace>
      &lt;/inScopeNamespaces>
    &lt;/element>
  &lt;/children>
&lt;/document></code></pre>


<p>
The OASIS Group canonicalizes this representation so they
can compare the infosets of two different documents produced by two
different parsers.
For XInclude, I'd use XSLT to combine and process 
the documents , possibly along with a couple of extension functions. Finally, the entire result could be written out as a serialized XML document. This is not nearly as efficient as my current more direct approach, but something like this might be the only reasonable way to achieve full conformance to 
XInclude. 
</p>

<p>
Currently, the OASAIS group is using XSLT to generate this representation
which misses some parts of the Infoset
that the XPath data model doesn't include, particularly the unparsed entities and notation information items I'm concerned about. However, it would be easy enough to generate this from SAX.

 an open source XML parser. 
 This is primarily a bug fix release.
However, a new XNI parser configuration interface has been added
to allow the creation of "pull" parser configurations. In
addition, more XNI documentation has been written that explains
how to re-use the standard Xerces2 parser components.

Xerces2 supports XML 1.0, Namespaces, DOM Level 2 (including
events, traversal, and range), SAX 2.0,  and JAXP 1.1. Xerces2
does not yet support XML Schema and has removed support for the
deferred DOM implementation.

Xerces2 is a nearly complete rewrite of the Xerces 1.x codebase
in order to make the code cleaner, more modular, and easier to
maintain. Applications using only the standard interfaces such
as JAXP, DOM, and SAX should not see any differences.

I've posted the first development version of a <a href="XInclude/">SAX-based XInclude program</a>
I wrote in Java. This is believed to be a complete implementation of the XInclude working draft with the exception of XPointer support.
It is somewhat more complete than the DOM and JDOM versions I posted earlier.
In particular it detects invalid values of the <code>parse</code> attribute and supports the <code>encoding</code> attribute for included text documents. 
I'll probably add these features to the DOM and JDOM versions soon.

</p>

<p>
I'll be talking about all three of these programs next week at Software Development East in Boston. 
Registration is still open, and we're also looking for a few more

The Apache XML project has released Xerces-J 1.4.3,
an open source XML parser written in Java. This is a bug fix release.
According to IBM's Neil Graham
"The largest difference between it
and Xerces-J 1.4.2 is that the Xerces-J DOM implementation has been
Reorganized to separate the Core functionality (new classes:
<code>CoreDOMImplementationImpl</code>, <code>CoreDocumentImpl</code>), from the complete DOM
(<code>DOMImplementationImpl</code>, <code>DocumentImpl</code>).  It also incorporates general
bugfixes to schema support as well as fixes to allow it to operate better
on OS/390."
New features are being developed exclusively in the Xerces-J 2.0 tree.

The W3C has published a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-patent-policy-20010816/">first and last call working draft of the W3C
Patent Policy Framework</a>. Boiled down, what this says is that all W3C
members have to tell the working groups what relevant patents they hold.
There's no obligation to offer any sort of license to
anybody on any terms.  
 Frankly, this is far too weak. I would prefer a policy that stated
that all W3C members must dedicate all relevant patents to the public
domain, but short of that it would probably be enough to say that all
W3C members must offer royalty-free licenses to all implementers.
However, since the W3C is bought and paid for by its corporate members
the chance of this happening is virtually nil.
Comments are due by September 30.

The W3C Core XML Working Group has published the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/PR-xml-infoset-20010810">Proposed Recommendation
of the XML Infoset</a>. At first glance, there do not appear to be any major changes since the candidate recommendation, though I do wish 
working groups would publish change lists between versions. 
</p>

<p>
The XML Infoset is an effort to define what is and is not significant about an XML document. For example, the content of an element is
significant. Whether or not that content came from parsed text,
an external entity, an internal entity, or a CDATA section is not.
If this had been published right after Namespaces in XML had been released,
then it might have been more useful. However, the fact is we're already awash in different models of what matters in an XML document including SAX, DOM,
and XPath, all of which are subtly incompatible with each other.

The Apache XML Project has
posted the first beta quality release of 
<a href="http://xml.apache.org/dist/xerces-j/">Xerces 2.0.0</a>, an open source XML parser written in Java.
The Xerces2 beta release has been greatly improved since the

The
WAP Forum has released a draft of the
<a href="http://www.wapforum.org/what/review.htm">WAP 2.0 architecture specification</a> for public review.
WAP 2.0 will be based on XHTML and CSS, rather than the current WML,
though some sops will be thrown to backwards compatibility.
WAP 2.0  also uses straight TCP/IP, HTTP/1.1, and TLS rather than WAP's
existing custom protocols. This is all good and should help open up the WAP world to a broader variety of content providers. However, none of it addresses the fundamental flaw in WAP: cell phones are designed to support audio not text.  
Until this is fixed, WAP will continue to fail.
</p>

<p>
On the not so good side, WAP 2.0 promises that
"Push technology allows trusted application servers to proactively send personalized content to the
end-user, such as a sales offer for a product a person might be interested in buying, a new email
notification, or a location-dependent promotion." In other words WAP 2.0 is spam-enabled.

<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/releases/">Mozilla 0.9.3</a> has been released for the usual batch of platforms.
This is primarily a bug fix release.
I found Mozilla 0.9.2 to be a step backward from
Mozilla 0.9.0. Hopefully, this release restores some of the stability
that was lost in 0.9.2.

In related news, <a href="http://galeon.sourceforge.net/info.html">Galeon</a> is a Gecko based 
browser specifically for Linux Gnome. Galeon uses the Gecko rendering engine,
but replaces most of the rest of the browser built on top of that.
It focuses on providing just a browser, no email client, chat program,
news reader, calendar manager, or food processor. It's just a browser,
and consequently loads much faster than megaware programs like
Mozilla and IE. Because of licensing problems,
it does require that you have Mozilla installed separately, however.
It's not quite ready for nondeveloper end users yet, but 
it looks very promising for the future.

Version 0.5 of of the open source
<a href="http://exist.sourceforge.net">eXist XML
database</a> has  been
released.
 XML is either stored in
the internal, native XML-DB or an external realtional database.
 The search engine has
been designed to provide fast XPath queries, using indexes for all
element, text and attribute nodes. 
This release introduces a pure Java implementation of the native XML
storage backend, which is better optimized for efficiently
storing, indexing and retrieving XML. The server now provides access
by XML-RPC calls as well as HTTP, supports document collections and
integrates well with Cocoon2.

"To allow or include relevant enhancements from target domains such as GIS/Mapping, CAD/Design, Mobile, Printing and Web Design."
Hopefully, someone on the working group realize that
CAD and GIS Mapping require the ability to
define sizes in real world units rather than onscreen units.
There's a lot of other neat stuff here too, like 
rotations and word wrapping. I just pray that 
backwards compatibility with the brain damaged coordinate
system in SVG 1.0 doesn't prove to be too big a millstone around SVG 2.0's neck.

<p>
I've been spending a lot of time lately with 
Docbook and <acronym title="XSL Formatting Objects">XSL-FO</acronym> as part of the ongoing development
of my next book, <cite><a href="books/xmljava/">Processing XML with Java</a></cite>. To that end, I've been putting the various <acronym title="XSL Formatting Objects">XSL-FO</acronym> engines on the 
market through their paces. I'm trying to find one that will actually let me produce the complete, finished book from my Docbook source code and Norm Walsh's
 XSLT-to-<acronym title="XSL Formatting Objects">XSL-FO</acronym> stylesheet. I thought I'd share my experiences here.
</p>

<p>
So far, I've experimented with four different <acronym title="XSL Formatting Objects">XSL-FO</acronym> processors: 
the Apache XML Project's <a href="http://xml.apache.org/fop/index.html">FOP</a>,
Sebastian Rahtz's
<a href="http://users.ox.ac.uk/%7Erahtz/passivetex/">PassiveTeX</a>, the
<a href="http://www.antennahouse.com/">Antenna House XSL Formatter 1.1E</a>, and
RenderX's <a href="http://www.renderx.com/FO2PDF.html">XEP</a>.
Two are implemented
in Java, one in native Windows code, and 
one in TeX. FOP and PassiveTeX are open source.
Antenna House and XEP are payware. Here are my experiences with each:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>FOP</dt>
<dd>
<p>
FOP was the first <acronym title="XSL Formatting Objects">XSL-FO</acronym> engine and is certainly the most popular.
It's open source and far easier to install than PassiveTeX, the other 
open source alternative. However, of the ones I was able to actually test
it produced by far the worst output.  It had the most annoying formatting troubles.
For example, it ate all the blank lines in my source code examples and put
extra indentation at the front of the first line of each example. 
I've noticed that probably more than half of
the bug reports  on the Docbook-APPS mailing list 
about the Docbook <acronym title="XSL Formatting Objects">XSL-FO</acronym> stylesheets can actually be attributed to bugs in FOP. FOP is improving rapidly -- one major bug I noted
 in footnote handling
was fixed in the last couple of weeks while I was performing my tests --
but it's clearly not even an alpha quality release yet.
A lot of work needs to be done before FOP can be recommended for 
more than experimentation.</p>
</dd>
<dt>XEP</dt>
<dd>
<p>I was unable to get XEP to run. It was totally
non-functional, and did not produce any output. 
I know some other people have gotten it to run -- the 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/CR-xsl-20001121/xslspecRX.pdf">PDF 
version of the XSL specification</a> was produced with XEP.
However, it simply did not work for me at all.
However good the XEP engine may be at converting <acronym title="XSL Formatting Objects">XSL-FO</acronym> documents 
to PDF, its horrible user interface and incomprehensible installation
procedure 
eliminated it from my consideration. </p>
</dd>
<dt>PassiveTeX</dt>
<dd>
<p>PassiveTex did a very good job formatting most of my document.
There were a few issues involving improperly scaled images, but those were easily fixed by adding some width attributes to my source XML document.
Once that was done, the only major bug was a failure to properly calculate 
page numbers in the table of contents. There was also one quirky instance 
where the first bullet point in a list was not indented quite right, but this 
didn't seem to occur in other bulleted lists. 
</p>
<p>
The downside to PassiveTeX is that it depends on a "decent modern TeX setup";
and TeX is invariably a nightmare. If my Linux distribution hadn't included
TeX by default, I would have been lost. As it is, I consider myself lucky
to have been able to get PassiveTeX running; and it still fails one time out of every two. This is probably due to TeX's unusual multipass architecture.
You sometimes have to run TeX a second time to get the links and cross-references right. In my case, the first pass succeeds but the second pass invariably fails. Thus I never get proper cross-references to page numbers in the table of contents and elsewhere. Otherwise, the output produced is quite attractive

</p>
</dd>
<dt>Antenna House XSL Formatter</dt>
<dd>
<p>
The Antenna House XSL Formatter produced very attractive output,
on a par with that generated by PassiveTeX and much better than FOP's.
I noticed no major flaws or cosmetic bugs. Antenna House also claims 
they're the only formatter able to handle mixed writing-modes such as "tb-rl" for Chinese/Japanese/Korean, though I didn't test that.
</p>

<p>
Most importantly, Antenna House had by far the easiest installation and the nicest user interface of all the formatters tested. More work is still needed, but at least I could conceive of giving this formatter to a non-programmer end-user. The others all have effectively non-existent user interfaces,
and horrible installation procedures. The Antenna house formatter was the only 
one of the four that took me less than an hour from download to first use.
</p>

<p>
The downside to this otherwise excellent engine is that it's Windows only
and based on Windows graphics primitives rather than PostScript or PDF.
It displays on the screen very nicely, and prints nicely too. However, 
it does not produce a PDF document that I can send to my editor or a 
typesetter. 
</p>

</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Bottom line:
none of the formatters are yet suitable for producing a finished product.
�one of them can replace TeX or QuarkXPress.
You might be able to publish a simple book with these, but you'd have to design your book
and style sheet so that you avoided the bugs and unimplemented features of 
the processor. Antenna House probably produces the most polished output, and I'd use it if all I wanted to do was print out a document from my laser printer.
However, since I need PDF files I can send to my editors and download
to a typesetter, my choice for the time being is PassiveTeX.

The W3C SVG Working Group has published the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/PR-SVG-20010719/index.html">Proposed Recommendation
for Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)</a>,
an XML application for two-dimensional line art such as cartoons, blueprints,
technical drawings, businenss graphics, or anything else you'd produce
with Visio/KIllustrator/CorelDraw/PowerPoint/etc. 
There's no change document, and I haven't read through the entire spec yet,
but I don't expect the changes are too major. 
</p>

<p>
I am disapoinnted that they didn't change the underlying model
for how coordinates are measured. I didn't really expect them to. 
Nonentheless I think the definitions used for pixels, inches, user 
units, and the whole coordinate space are feet of clay for the rest of the specification. 
They've already been proven to confuse developers,
and I think they're going to make SVG less generally useful than it should be.
In brief, it's impossible to assign an absolute size to a picture.
I cannot say that the chair I draw is one meter tall and half a meter wide.
Thus there's no way to guarantee that the chair I draw will fit in the door
of the house you draw. What I think is needed is a way of specifying the actual physical dimensions of a picture, and a preferred scale factor for moving that
drawing onto the screen. The model they've chosen is suitable for single-file line art on Web pages, but not for more complex technical drawings and pictures that are built from many different pieces by many different artists. 
Some of the problems I noted are under consideration
for changes in SVG 2.0. However, the problems are rooted
so deep in the foundations of SVG that I don't know that
they can be fixed in a backwards compatible way.

Units</a> and <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-css3-cascade-20010713">Cascading and
inheritance</a>. The Values and Units module "describes the various
values and units that CSS properties accept. Also, it describes how
'specified values', which is what a style sheet contains, are processed
into 'computed values' and 'actual values'." This version of the module
does not introduce any new features, merely rewriting the equivalent
parts of CSS level 2 in the form of a CSS3 module. However, new features
are planned for a future version. The Cascading and inheritance module
"describes how values are assigned to properties. CSS allows several
style sheets to influence the rendering of a document, and the process
of combining these style sheets is called 'cascading'. If no value can
be found through cascading, a value can be inherited from the parent
element or the property's initial value is used."

This is a revised canoncial form that is supposed to allow
individual elements to be cut and paste from one document to another
while maintaining the same canoncial form. Currently, the canonical form of an element can change based on namesapces in scope that are not actually used.
Thsi is a problem for applications that want to sign only a part of a document such as the Body of a SOAP message rather than the entire document. 
The problem here is real. It's not, however, clear to me 
that the propsed solution actually works in the face of namespace declarations
used in attribute values (XSLT, Schemas) and element content (SOAP).

The W3C XML Protocol Working Group has published two new working drafts
on the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-xmlp-am-20010709/">XML Protocol Abstract Model</a>  and 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-soap12-20010709/">SOAP Version 1.2</a>.
SOAP is 
"an XML
          based protocol that consists of four parts: an envelope that defines a framework for describing what is in a message and how to
          process it, a set of encoding rules for expressing instances of application-defined data types, a convention for representing
          remote procedure calls and responses and a binding convention for exchanging messages using an underlying protocol. SOAP
          can potentially be used in combination with a variety of other protocols; however, the only bindings defined in this document
          describe how to use SOAP in combination with HTTP and the experimental HTTP Extension Framework."
I'm disappointed that this draft fixes exactly none of the problems I noted in
SOAP 1.1 including:          
</p>

<ul>
	<li>The proper namespace is not required.</li>
	<li>Document type declarations are explicitly forbidden.
	(The spec is actually contradictory on this point.)
	</li>
	<li>Processing instructions are forbidden.</li>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
However, perhaps I can push to get some of this fixed before SOAP 1.2 goes gold.
I'm writing Chapter 2 of <cite><a href="books/xmljava/">Processing XML with Java</a></cite> right now, 
which is all about 
XML Protocols and SOAP, so I'm spending a lot of time thinking about this sort of stuff.

Beta 7 of JDOM has been posted.
JDOM is a Java-centric API for processing XML documents.
This release adds:
</p>


<ul>
	<li>XSLT support via JAXP</li>
	<li>A correctly implemented entity model</li>
	<li>A vastly more robust SAXBuilder (with a public SAXHandler,  pluggable factories, and 
	<code>create<i>XXX</i>()</code> methods to simplify subclassing)</li>
	<li>More reliable building and outputting</li>
	<li>A convenient <code>detach() </code>method for all tree objects</li>
	<li>The much-desired <code>setName()</code> and <code>setNamespace()</code> methods on <code>Element</code></li>
	<li>Machine-readable version information in META-INF</li>
	<li>Significant performance improvements</li>
	<li>Many bug fixes</li>
</ul>

<p>
The API is in general not compatible with beta 6, 
so you will need to rewrite your code to upgrade to beta 7.
The same basic functionality is there so mostly
it's a matter of changing some method names.

XML 
Encryption
specifies a process for encrypting data using any algorithm or key length

data at all, though  XML documents, individual XML elements, 
and XML element content can also be encrypted. 
The encrypted data is stored in an <code>EncryptedData</code> element 
which either contains 
          the Base-64 encoded encrypted data 
          or points to it with a URI.
A "decryption transform" allows verification of
 XML Signatures verification when both signature

The W3C XML Core Working Group has posted the first public draft of
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-xml-blueberry-req-20010620">XML Blueberry Requirements</a>.
This is a proposal for a new <strong>backwards incompatible</strong> 
 version of XML. The specific goal is to address some shortcomings of the XML 1.0 
character model relative to Unicode 3.1, as well as throwing a sop to IBM.
</p>


<p>
The concern with respect to IBM is that one of the world's largest corporations,
with thousands of patents, legions of programmers, billions of dollars in revenue, 
and resources pouring out of every orifice is somehow unable to handle 
documents where lines end with carriage returns and line feeds,
as documents do on every non-IBM system on the planet. 
The only reason there's a problem here at all
 is because IBM tried to go it alone as a monopoly 
and set standards by fiat for years rather than  working with the rest of 
the industry. Consequently their mainframe character sets don't really interoperate well with
everybody else's character sets. In XML this arises as a 
problem with line endings when someone
edits an XML document with an IBM mainframe text editor. 
IBM mostly grew out of their anti-competitive monopolistic tendencies over 
the last thirty years (with a large dose of assistance from the U.S. 
 government). However, there are still some legacy issues relating to their 
 attempt to dictate standards to the rest of the industry, and this is one of them.
 Now rather than fixing their own broken mainframe text editing software,
 they want everyone else on the planet to change their software so IBM doesn't have 
 to. (If this reminds anybody of the current mess with Oracle and UTF-8, you're not alone.)
 This proposal was laughed out of the W3C a few months ago when IBM made it,
 or at least it seemed to be. However, it's now risen from the dead as part of 
 XML Blueberry; but it doesn't make any more sense now than it did then;
 and it still deserves to be laughed off the table with whooping cries of
 derision. 
</p>

<p>
The second proposal
for breaking backwards compatibility with existing parsers
 is much more serious, and requires a more thoughtful response. 
 Starting in Unicode 3.0 
 a number of new characters have been added both for new scripts that were 
 previously unencoded such as Amharic and Cherokee
as well as for old scripts that were incomplete such as Chinese.
 The concern is that since XML 1.0 is based on Unicode 2.0, 
"fully native-language XML markup is not possible in at least the following languages: Amharic,
          Burmese, Canadian aboriginal languages, Cantonese (Bopomofo script), Cherokee, Dhivehi, Khmer, Mongolian
          (traditional script), Oromo, Syriac, Tigre, Yi. In addition, Chinese, Japanese, Korean (Hangul script), and
          Vietnamese can make use of only a limited subset of their complete character repertoires."
 </p>
 
 
 <p>
 If this were true, it would be a very serious criticism of XML 1.0
Fortunately, however, the claim is not nearly as dire 
as the proposal makes out. Indeed the proposal substantially overstates the need
for any changes.
The XML 1.0 BNF productions do not allow these newly defined characters to be used in element,
attribute, and entity names. However, they can be used in the text of element content and attribute values. 
This means that XML is fully adequate for literature and data in
Amharic, Burmese, Canadian aboriginal languages, Cantonese, Cherokee, Dhivehi, Khmer, Mongolian, Oromo, Syriac, Tigre, Yi, Mandarin, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese. Only the markup, that is, the tags, would have to be written in another script. Given that there aren't even localized operating systems 
in most of these languages, and that today's software effectively 
requires users to have a solid knowledge of at least the ASCII characters, 
I don't think
the need to write markup (as opposed to text) in Cherokee justifies breaking 
backwards compatibility.
</p>

<p>
But wait! It's not even that bad.
Several of the languages listed are total red herrings.
You most certainly can write markup 
in Cantonese, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin, and Vietnamese today.
The new characters Unicode has added to these scripts are very obscure.
In fact, experts often disagree over whether some of them exist at all,
or are merely typographical variations of existing characters.
Since the 1700s Vietnamese has been written in a Latin-based alphabet that is fully available
in XML and that can write any Vietnamese word. Vietnamese
only uses the Han ideographs for classical documents and occasional signage or
decoration, and it seems very unlikely that a Vietnamese speaker would write
their markup using Han ideographs.   
Japanese has not one but two phonetic alphabets that can write any Japanese word if the right Han ideograph character is not encoded.
Chinese speakers can use either Latin characters or the native Bopomofo phonetic system for the very rare cases where a character they need is not encoded.
The fact is most native speakers of Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese do not recognize the vast majority of these new characters, and
the need for them in markup (again, as opposed to text) is non-existent. 
</p>


<p>
There are a few good points in this proposal. I'm sure there's an occasional need for writing markup in Amharic, Burmese, Khmer, Mongolian, Yi, and a few of the other languages the proposal lists. But I don't believe there's enough of a need to justify breaking compatibility with existing XML parsers, 
software, and systems. The XML Blueberry Requirements vastly overstate the case
 by ignoring the difference between <em>markup</em> and <em>text</em> in XML documents.  
I'd be willing to break backwards compatibility to allow text in
these languages if we had to, but we don't. Text is already adequately handled by XML 1.0. All we're arguing about now are the tags, and that's just not a strong enough reason to break backwards compatibility.

This updated version corrects some errors from the printed book as well as 
adding additional new material about binary data types,
simple type derivation, and attribute declarations.
Overall, this is a complete introduction to the W3C XML Schema Language. 
Enjoy!

web sites using server-side transformations of XML based content. It
contains many features for delivering the same content to different
devices, and also for building dynamic content for different devices. It
features a number of transformation and language modules including XSLT,
Apache XSP and XPathScript. AxKit also implements a high performance cache

The dbXML project has released version 0.9 of
the <a href="http://www.dbxml.org/">dbXML Core XML Database</a>,
a native XML database designed to manage
large collections of small XML documents. The server supports XPath
queries and uses an implementation of the XML:DB XML Database API for
development of client applications. 
Features added include an XML:DB XUpdate implementation for updating XML
documents, SAX support in the API and a compression mechanism to
increase performance between the client and the server. The server is now considered feature complete.
Source code for the
dbXML Core is now available under an Apache style license.

There are methods for converting DOM nodes to XPath booleans, strings,
numbers, nodes, and node sets but no functionality for 
finding the nodes that match a given XPath expression within a document.
Maybe TRAX can pick upnthe slack there?

                            bugs." In addition,
the Modern skin has been overhauled with a lighter and

The question of whether links are styles or semantics is one that's been causing
strife inside W3C working groups for some time.
Of course the real answer is "Yes". Style and semantics aren't nearly as 
cleanly separable in the real world as they are in Tim Berners-Lee's vision
of the Web. This is just one manifestation of that problem.

I've updated my <a href="XInclude/">DOM and JDOM
XInclude processors</a> to support the latest May 5 Working Draft of
XInclude. This means you'll need to change you XInclude namespace URI to
http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude. The DOM version is working again, though you'll need to use Xerces 1.4
or later. Other parsers may work as well. Earlier versions of Xerces do not.
</p>

<p> 
I think this is now an accurate implementation of the full XInclude specification
except for XPointer support. 
This required changing the API to work primarily with lists and node lists
rather then directly with elements and nodes. However, the API should not
need to change again to support XPointer. Merging in XPointer support should be an internal
implementation detail.  
The software processes my files successfully, but formal
testing has been minimal so let me know if you spot
any problems.

      <li><a href="books/bible2/chapters/ch20.html">Chapter 20: XPointers</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
These are the complete updated chapters that appear in the printed book.
All have been significantly revised since the first edition two years ago. 
The XPointers chapter in particular has been updated from the revised first edition chapter I've had
posted here for the last year or so, though all four are somewhat more 
current than what 
I've previously published. I also plan to publish one more chapter, <cite>Schemas</cite>, here

I used <a href="http://www.infinity-loop.de/en/products.html">Upcast</a> to 
convert  the Word documents to XHTML, and then used XSLT to convert the XHTML into something
readable. There may still be a few bugs in the process.
The pictures are a little small and fuzzy, but should be mostly legible. 
I'll fix that when I get a minute. Otherwise,
please 
let me know if you spot any formatting idiosyncracies.
</p>
<p>
I'm still looking for a good Word-to-XML/HTML converter.
Upcast gets me part of the way there, but a very complex XSLT stylesheet was still needed
to finish the job. I ruled out <a href="http://www.logictran.com/net2rtf.html">Logictran's RTFConverter</a>
 even though it did a much better job than 
Upcast of producing readable HTML on my first pass because it lost 
all information about styles. My Word documents use styles very heavily to allow
 almost semantic markup of documents, and I can't afford to convert that into pure 
visual presentation.

  and register an XML
  artifact without deposit. 
 Users can search of registered objects based on their

        running on IBM's servers, rather than a software product you download and install

It's available now from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0764547607/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/">Amazon</a>,
<a href="http://www1.fatbrain.com/asp/bookinfo/bookinfo.asp?theisbn=0764547607&amp;vm=">FatBrain</a>, 
and other purveyors of computer books. This edition was extensively revised on almost every page.
Every section and example was brought completely up to date with the state of the art in XML in 2001,
and many new chapters were added. There are four completely
new chapters in this edition covering:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Schemas</li>
	<li>Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)</li>
	<li>The Wireless Markup Language (WML)</li>
	<li>XHTML</li>
</ul>

<p>
Many other chapters were totally revised to bring them up to date 
with the latest version of various specifications, including:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>XSLT</li>
	<li>XSL Formatting Objects</li>
	<li>XLinks</li>
	<li>XPointers</li>
	<li>Namespaces</li>
</ul>

<p>
I am now happy to say that this book is almost 
completely in-sync with all the latest XML specifications including
the second edition of XML 1.0, XSLT 1.0, XPath 1.0, and the latest drafts of XLink
and XPointer. 
(The one exception, unfortunately, are a few bugs in the later parts of the schemas chapter, 
particularly with regard to attribute declarations. That's the penalty for working on the bleeding edge.
But even so, the vast majority of the examples in the schemas chapter are completely
current with XML Schemas 1.0. I'll post the updates for the schemas material here soon.)
</p>

<p>
Perhaps most importantly, I rewrote almost every word, sentence, and paragraph 
 to make the exposition clearer,
the examples shorter, and the XML terminology more accurate. Mixed content finally gets its due.
External DTDs are now emphasized in preference to internal DTDs, and everywhere I'm careful to
distinguish between document type <em>definitions</em> and document type <em>declarations</em>. 
Mozilla and Opera are now used throughout the text as well as Internet Explorer. 
Since the first edition was released a year and a half ago, XML has gone from a bleeding edge
technology to a solid. well-tested, and well-proved foundation
 of many of today's technologies. The second edition of the <cite>XML Bible</cite> 
 reflects the increased maturity and stability of XML. 
</p>


<p>
This is in every way a much better book than the first edition. If you liked the first edition,
you'll love this edition. If you didn't like the first edition, you may find that the second edition 
fixes what bothered you about the first. The second edition is still only $49.99 
even though it's more than 200 pages and 20%
longer than the first edition. There is unfortunately no upgrade path, as is the case for most paper  books.
However, I will be posting some of the updated chapters here at Cafe con Leche in the near future, and the usual discounts do apply. 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0764547607/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/">Amazon</a> and 
<a href="http://www1.fatbrain.com/asp/bookinfo/bookinfo.asp?theisbn=0764547607&amp;vm=">FatBrain</a> are selling it for $39.99.
Bookpool doesn't have it in stock yet but should get it soon. 
Amazon almost always sells out of my new books within a few hours of me announcing one here,
but generally gets more instock much more quickly than they say they will.
It will not take 4-6 weeks to get your copy. 
Many brick-and-mortar bookstores still have the first edition on the shelves. 
You can recognize the second edition by the robot on the cover.
(A special prize goes out to the first person who successfully guesses just what that
robot has to do with XML and the content of the book.)
If you need to special order it, 
the title is <cite>XML Bible, 2nd Edition</cite>.
The ISBN number is 0-7645-4760-7, and it's written by me, Elliotte Rusty Harold.

The Apache Batik team has released <a href="http://xml.apache.org/batik">Batik 1.0</a>,
an SVG viewer written in Java.
Batik 1.0 supports most of the static SVG features, 
linking, and some  scripting.
New features since the last beta include:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Full filter effects support: lighting filters, drop shadows, 
  displacement effects and more.</li>
<li> Full text support: Batik 1.0 supports embedded and external SVG 
  Fonts, international text, vertical text and other fancy text
  features such as text on a path.

There's a new hidden feature on Cafe con Leche and Cafe au Lait this month.
If you view the source code for this page you'll notice that
the individual dates all have <code>id</code> attributes like this:
</p>

<p><code>&lt;dt id="news2001May15"&gt;Tuesday, May 15, 2001&lt;/dt></code></p>

<p>
This means you can now link to the news from a particular date, at least in an HTML 
4.0 compatible browser that supports <code>id</code> attributes
as fragment identifiers.
(Netscape 4 has problems with these.)
I started adding these on May 8. Eventually I may try to figure out a regular expression that
will let me add this to all 
the old news, but the format should be fairly consistent going forward:
</p>

<p><code>id := "news" + 4digitYear + monthName + 2digitDate</code></p>

of <cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-xinclude-20010516">XML Inclusions (XInclude) Version 1.0</a></cite>. 
XInclude allows you to build large XML documents out of smaller XML documents that
are themselves well-formed and potentially valid.
Changes in this release are fairly minor.
The big one is that the namespace  is now
<code>http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude</code> and the default prefix is <code>xi</code>
(though as always the prefix can change as long as the namespace 
URI remains the same). The functionality and model seems essentially the same.

</p>


<p>
Telecom Act Nixed -- Feds Hand Bells the Net
</p>

<p>
This is very likely to be a headline you'll read in next week's paper.
When it happens -- and it is happening -- ISPs and CLECs are history,
and monopolies rule again.  You have just a few weeks to change
tomorrow's history, and you have the world's greatest tool for change
right at your fingertips.
</p>

<p>
Post notices on news groups, use your mailing list, chat, whatever,
as long as you CALL FOR ACTION NOW!  There is federal legislation
that threatens to hand the Bells the Net.  It is called H.R. 1542,
misleadingly named the Broadband Relief Act of 2001.  It is authored
by two very powerful Congressmen, House Commerce Chairman W.J. "Billy"
Tauzin (R-LA) and Ranking Minority Member John Dingell (D-MI), and
supported - surprise, surprise, by only four companies.  Perhaps
you've heard of them: SBC, Verizon, Bell South and Qwest.
</p>

<p>
In essence, the bill allows the RBOCs to immediately begin offering
long-distance data service, and eliminates the Telecom Act's
requirement that they lease parts of their networks -- including
equipment used for high-speed Internet service -- to competitors.
Out goes the competition, up go the prices.
</p>

<p>
Share this information with your friends, family, customers,
colleagues today!  Beg them to make their voices heard.  Do
they really want the local phone monopoly running the Internet?
Do they want higher prices, lousy service, and no new technology?
</p>

<p>
USISPA, the US Internet Service Providers Alliance, is comprised of
ISPs and ISP state association across the country, and we are working
in the trenches trying to protect consumers and the Internet from the
Bell monopolies.  We need your help in letting Congress know that what
they're trying to do, on the Bells' dime, is not okay with America.
</p>

<p>
We willing and ready to help you any way we can.  Please call or email
Debra Sweezey of the US Internet Service Providers Alliance, and we'll
give you all the information you need.  We will give you the contact
information for your local representative in addition to sample
statements or letters, or we're happy to contact your representative
on your behalf.  Whatever's easiest for you.
</p>

<p>
We hope you will join the fight for a free and open Internet.  We need
you!
</p>

<p>
This message comes to you through the United States Internet Service
Providers Alliance (USISPA), an alliance of state ISP associations
and ISP across the country working to ensure a fair and competitive
open telecommunications environment nationwide.  For more info

I've been using Mozilla 0.8.1 a lot lately, and found it very stable and useful.
This is certainly the best XML browser on the market, bar none.
Right now it supports XML, DOM2, CSS, and HTML 4. 
In the future I suspect it to get even stronger with native suport for real XSLT,
MathML, SVG, XHTML, and more. It's gotten a bad rep because a lot of people 
confuse it with Netscape 6, a truly abominable product on the order of 
Microsoft Bob.
However, although Mozilla and Netscape 6 are derived from the same code base,
they are actually quite different browsers. Mozilla is far more stable
and less spam-ridden than Netscape 6.

I've updated my <a href="XInclude/">XInclude processor</a> to version 1.0d4. 
This is
written in Java and requires the current CVS version of JDOM.
Today's release doesn't add a lot of functionality. 
About the only new feature is that comments and processing
instructions that are outside the root element of an included document
are now included.
However, it makes major modifications to the API.
The big difference is that the <code>resolve()</code> method now returns 
a <code>List</code> of nodes instead of an <code>Object</code> that is a node.
This is necessary prerequisite for XPointer support
because an XPointer may point to more than one node. 
</p>

<p>
Update: I just noticed that my latest changes to XIncluder exposed a bug
in JDOM. The effect is that included elements are included in front of the
elements they're supposed to be after. I've submitted a patch for the JDOM bug.
Assuming it's accepted and integrated, the new XIncluder should work as expected.

written in Java and requires the current CVS version of JDOM. This
release fixes one major bug (the position of comments and processing
instructions outside the root element is now maintained). Furthermore,
I've cleaned up the code and rewritten a lot of the JavaDoc. Most
importantly, this release is now more conformant with the Working Draft
XInclude specification. In particular when it encounters an error with
an included document, it throws an exception and gives up. It no longer
puts an error message in the including document. (I still think this
should be a user configurable option. Maybe in the next release.)
The one major feature left to add is XPointer support. I've got a pretty good idea now how to
do this, and hope to get to it soon.
</p>

<p>
I also fixed the DOM version. However, in the process I discovered some bugs 
in Xerces-J involving cloning documents. I have reported the bugs
and am hopeful that they'll be fixed in Xerces-J 1.4.
Meanwhile, my fixed version won't work at all 
until the bugs in Xerces get fixed, so I haven't uploaded it yet. 
I recommend you use the JDOM version instead.

The XML Encryption Working Group has published its first public working
draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-xml-encryption-req-20010420">XML Encryption Requirements</a>.
This document lists the design principles, scope, and requirements for
a standard means of encrypting XML documents, and embedding encrypted documents
(both XML and non-XML) in XML documents.
The scope includes syntax, data model, format, cryptographic processing, patents
and other intellectual property, algorithms, human factors issues, and interaction with
other XML specifications such as the Document Object Model, XML Canonicalization
and XML Digital Signatures.

<p> Adobe's released <a href="http://www.adobe.com/acrobat/">Acrobat
5.0</a>, its $250 payware portable document creation tool. Acrobat
Reader 5.0 is free-beer. This version adds the capability to save the
contents of PDF files into other formats such as RTF, TIFF, JPEG, and
PNG. It supports 128-bit encrypted password protection and digital
signatures, and can restrict editing and printing (though that's not too
hard to break.) Acrobat forms  can now be talk to databases through XML.
Acrobat 5 also improves accessibility  a bit by supporting high-contrast
display settings and Windows-based screen readers, though it's still far
less accessible than native XML or HTML with appropriate uise of style
sheets.

Microsoft's posted "Technology Preview" (i.e. a beta) of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/xml/general/newinaprilre.asp">MSXML 4.0</a>, an
XML parser/XSLT processor for Windows and Internet Explorer. This
release features tentative support for the W3C XML Schema Language as

It is very difficult to get this version to replace IE's default MSXML 2.0 or

Once again I'm chairing the XML track for Software Development 2001 East. This year the show has moved to Boston, and will take place from August 27-31. Besides the change in venue, this year also sees the introduction of the co-located Web Services World, which I'm not involved with; but which some of you might also be interested in submitting proposals for. 
</p>

<p>
This is a hardcore developers show, but not a deep XML show. Attendees are looking for meaty, technical, how-to presentations on specific technologies like schemas, DTDs, SAX, DOM, JDOM, XLinks, XQuery, Schematron, RELAX, etc. Some things we are NOT looking for (at least in the XML track) are very broad analyses of business cases for XML, introductions to XML itself, very academic  presentations on hypertext theory, or advanced seminars that assume attendees are already intimate with schemas, XLinks, XSLT, and so forth. Of course this is all relative to the knowledge level of the audience. At this point, I think we could probably justify an advanced DTDs talk that discussed modularization using parameter entity references and namespaces. However, we probably wouldn't accept the same talk if it used schemas instead of DTDs because few people in our audience know a lot about schemas yet. On the other hand, we would be interested in a basic intro to schemas. 
</p>

<p>
In other words, this is a show geared towards working programmers, not a show geared toward academics, managers, or XML experts. We find our attendees come to this track to learn about XML, not because they already know a lot about XML and want to debate the finer arcana, so aim your talks at beginner and intermediate users, not the people who regularly post to this mailing list and write for XML.com. Ideally, we want a broad mix of technologies and presentations so attendees can walk in the first day of the show knowing nothing about XML, and walk out the last day having a solid grasp of what all the pieces of the XML puzzle are, how they fit together, and know enough to start using them. 
</p>

<p>
We have approximately one dozen 90-minute slots to fill. We are also open to intermediate level, 1-day tutorials on special topics like XSLT or Schemas. For the most part, we'll be looking for experienced speakers to fill these. If this is your first time presenting at a conference like this, it would be better to start with a couple of seminars rather than a full-day session. 
</p>

<p>
You can <a href="http://www.sdexpo.com/2001/east/speakers/">submit abstracts online</a>.
The deadline for abstracts is May 1, 2001.  Please submit your abstracts as soon as possible.  Abstracts which are selected will receive notification by email no later than May 15. Unfortunately, due to the volume of abstracts we receive, we cannot notify every submission regarding their status.

The W3C/IETF joint XML Digital 
Signature working group has released the second
Candidate Recommendation of 
 XML-Signature Syntax and Processing. 
 This defines an algorithm for
 signing XML and other documents using public key encryuption schemes
 and hash codes,
 embedding those signatures in XML documents 
 and embedding the signed documents in the digital signatures. 
 From the draft:
 </p>
 
<blockquote>
This version contains many bug-fixes, clarifications, and improvements
for DTD/schema extensibility and re-use. It reflects resolution of
recent (and past) issues and the Schema Proposed Recommendation. As
warned in the previous Candidate Recommendation, the minimal
canonicalization algorithm has been removed because the Working Group
could find no implementation. This specification is considered to be
very stable. The W3C Namespace Policy requires that if a change in the
namespace makes previously valid or compliant instances and
implementations invalid, the namespace must also change. Since the
clarifications do not substantively affect valid instance syntax or
implemented features, the namespace has not been changed.
</blockquote>
 
 <p>
 This phase is scheduled 
 to end  May 19,  2001.

"describes requirements for mechanisms that enable
fine-grained control of speech (signal processing) resources and
telephony resources in a VoiceXML telephony platform. The scope of these

The W3C XSLT Working Group has announced a decision to skip XSLT 1.1 and go 
straight to 2.0.
In my opion, this is a mistake. Despite some initial controversy over 
language-specific extension function bindings, XSLT 1.1 offered a great opportunity to
pick the low hanging fruit and clean up a few problems with XSLT 1.0
in a fairly quick fashion without compromising future development. 
XSLT 2.0 seems like a lot bigger project, and overall 
more risky than XSLT 1.1. 
I would have preferred to finish the easy improvements first without 
making them depend on much more complex things like XPath 2.0 and schema awareness.

I've heard occasional bad things about Sys-Con Media, the publishers of the
Java Developer's Journal and the XML Journal among other magazines,
 for a few years now. For the most part I've ignored the rumors and whispers since I haven't
 had any particular relationship with or interest in them.
 However, last year I spoke at a couple of Sys-Con branded conferences, XML DevCon 
 New York and San Jose, though these were actually run by Camelot Communications.
At some  point after that Sys-Con had a falling out with 
 Camelot. A contract dispute broke about between 
 Camelot and Sys-Con,
 various lawyers exchanged nasty letters, and legal proceedings were 
 initiated, though these seem to be mandatory arbitration rather 
 than actual lawsuits.
</p>

<p>
I wouldn't even know any of this was taking place except that in a rather unusual
stunt someone decided to be very public about the dispute. 
Earlier this year an unidentified person sent 
 a series of emails from a 
Hotmail account to speakers at various Camelot conferences
slamming Camelot for alleged non-payment of money owed to Sys-Con.
The email address used, camelotcomc@hotmail.com, was designed to
make it appear at first glance
that the communication came from Camelot Communications itself.
</p>


<p> I mostly shrugged off the initial emails, and didn't pay them much attention.
I have no idea whether Sys-Con's claims have merit, nor do I
much care. 
Sadly this is often how business is done in the U.S. today.
It's not really a surprise, and doesn't have much of an effect on
independent contractors like me working for either company, at least not in the
normal course of things. 
However, what did shock me and convince me that Sys-Con had crossed the line
was an email I and many other people received last week as part of
XML-J April Digital Edition, a free-subscription electronic newsletter about things
XML. What specifically bothered me was the following "news item" that ran as the lead story:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
TODAY's NEWS: XMLDEVCON 2001 OPENS TODAY IN NEW YORK WITH EMPTY CLASSROOMS
AND DISAPPOINTING TURNOUT ON THE EXHIBIT FLOOR!
</p>

<p>
(April 9, 2001) - XMLDevCon 2001 opened today in New York, with empty
classrooms, and a disappointing turnout on the exhibit floor. Organizers
of XMLDevCon promoted the expected attendance of the show to be more than
4,000 delegates. However, one of the classrooms that XML-J visited this
morning, showed approximately one dozen attendees. (See photo news..)<br/>
-> continued: http://www.sys-con.com/xml/
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
At the time I was on the other side of the country at 
the SDExpo West show;
but when I returned I made some inquiries of a number of people who were at the show, and
they all agreed that the story was grossly inaccurate.
There were over 2,000 attendees at XML DevCon New York; and although
this was fewer than attended last summer, it was still a good-sized crowd.
As always happens at such shows some classes were fuller than others,
and some were quite packed. 
</p>

<p>
There really wasn't much of a story here in the first place.
To the extent that there was a story, it was hardly a significant one.
I doubt that the  XML-J Digital Edition would even have covered it,
much less covered it in the way they did, 
except for one thing: Sys-Con is currently involved in a dispute with
Camelot. I can't help but believe that
Sys-Con is deliberately slanting their editorial content
to support their position in the dispute. 
Worse yet, they're doing it without any acknowledgement to the typical reader
that they are in such a dispute.
Most subscribers would have seen this as merely another news story,
without realizing the biases that lay behind it.
</p>

<p>
I don't mind Sys-Con using their newsletter to get out their message.
However, doing so in such a deceptive and misleading fashion really bothers me.
It makes me question whether I can trust anything in a Sys-Con publication.
If they give a product a good review, is it only because 
the manufacturer bought an ad? If they give a product a bad review,
is it only because they have a dispute with the manufacturer?
These are real issues in journalism, but for the most part 
there's a presumption of innocence.
Sys-Con has lost that presumption. This story makes it clear that 
the business and legal end of the company trump the editorial.
</p>

<p>
Before this whole mess erupted, I was debating whether to attend or speak at
the Sys-Con JavaEdge show in New York and the XMLEdge show in Santa Clara this fall.
I was leaning toward going to JavaEdge since it's local, and skipping XMLEdge since
it's not. But after this mess, my mind has been made up. I don't want anything to do with
Sys-Con, their conferences, or their magazines. I won't speak 
at their conferences. I won't write for their magazines. Whatever the merits of
their original claim against Camelot, 
the PR campaign they have pursued in support of it is bad enough.
The mixing of that PR campaign with their editorial content is indefensible.
This is not a publisher or company I want to
be involved with in any way.

with each other based on how fast they can race in exactly the wrong direction.
A good XML editor shoudl hide the structure of XML documents, not expose it.)

Version 0.2.1 of the open source
<a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/xsltsl/">XSLT Standard Library</a>
has been released.
This 
 is a collection of commonly-used
templates written  in pure XSLT 1.0.

Changes since v0.1 include:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>In the String module, capitalise template now capitalises all words
	in a string.  There's also a new substring-before-first template.</li>
	<li>A Node module with xpath and type templates</li>

<p>

<a href="http://dom4j.org">dom4j</a> is yet another open source Java library for working with XML.
The current version is 0.2.
The main new features of this release are:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Improved XPath integration</li>
	<li>Full JAXP, DOM, SAX and XSLT integration</li>
	<li>Better I/O support</li>
	<li>A SAXValidator for validating documents</li>
	<li>A cleaner API</li>
</ul>

<p>
It looks interesting. The obvious comparison is with JDOM. It uses 
interfaces rather than classes (a  minus for most developers) but does have  
<code>Node</code> and <code>Text</code> interfaces which JDOM does not, and which I
need in my work. However, the parent relationshipo for nodes is only optional,
which strikes me as a big minus. 
On the other hand, there's integrated XPath support which I consider a big plus.
JDOM may get this in version 1.1. These are just the results of a cursory first glance at the
API docs. A more detailed look will have to wait till a little time opens up.
Still, open source competition is a good thing.

The W3C HTML Working Group has released the
official recommendation of
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xhtml-modularization-20010410">Modularization of XHTML</a>.
This document
"specifies an abstract modularization of XHTML and
an implementation of
         the abstraction using XML Document Type Definitions (DTDs).
         This modularization provides a
         means for subsetting and extending XHTML, a feature
         needed for extending XHTML's reach onto
         emerging platforms." In other words, it lets you use
         create subsets of XHTML that leave out pieces you don't
         like such as tables or frames while adding new pieces you
         do need such as Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) or MathML.

The W3C CSS Working Group has posted the first public working draft
of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-css3-mediaqueries-20010404">Media Queries</a>.
According to the draft:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>HTML4 and CSS2 currently support media-dependent style sheets
tailored for different <em>media types</em>. For example, a document
may use sans-serif fonts when displayed on a screen and serif fonts
when printed. "Screen" and "print" are two of the media types that
have been defined. To describe in more detail what type of devices a
style sheet applies to, this document proposes <em>media queries</em>.</p>

<p>A media query consists of a media type and one or more expressions to
limit the scope of a certain style sheet. Among the proposed <em>media
features</em> that can be used in expressions are "width", "height",
and "color". By using media queries, content presentations can be
tailored to a range of devices without changing the content
itself.</p>

EXSLT is an open community initiative to standardise and document
XSLT extension functions and elements. The extensions are broken down into a number of
modules including Common, Math, Sets and Functions.
One aim of EXSLT is to get the implementers of XSLT processors to
standardise the functions that they make available, so that
stylesheets can be more portable.

Microsoft and Verisign, two companies with deservedly poor reputations
for designing and managing secure systems, as well as webMethods,
have submitted a note to the W3C on
a proposed
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/NOTE-xkms-20010330/">XML Key Management
Specification (XKMS)</a>.
According to the abstract,
</p>

<blockquote>
This document specifies protocols for distributing and registering public keys, suitable for use in conjunction with
          the proposed standard for XML Signature [XML-SIG] developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and
          the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and an anticipated companion standard for XML encryption.� The
          XML Key Management Specification (XKMS) comprises two parts -- the XML Key Information Service
          Specification (X-KISS) and the XML Key Registration Service Specification (X-KRSS).
</blockquote>

 <p>
 I haven't had time to read through the entire specification,
 but technical merit aside, I think it should be rejected
 on intellectual property (IP) grounds alone.
 The submitters seeem to want to make some unspecified IP  claims on the technologies
 described in the spec, and are not willing to open up those technologies for
 free and unconstrained use by anyobne who wants to use them.

<a href="http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr27/">Unicode 3.1</a> has
been released.
  The primary new feature of Unicode 3.1 is the addition of 44,946 new
encoded characters. Together with the 49,194 already existing characters in
Unicode 3.0, that comes to a grand total of 94,140 encoded characters in
Unicode 3.1.
The new characters cover several historic scripts, several sets of symbols,
and a very large collection of additional CJK ideographs. Unicode 3.1 also
features new character properties, and assignments of property values for
the much expanded repertoire of characters.
</p>
<p>
The XML 1.0 specification anticipated this development and is ready to handle these characters.
However many parsers, including all those written in Java, depend on APIs that are not
Unicode 3.1 ready. For instance, any parser or API that uses a
Java <code>String</code>
to store XML text will fail when confronted with the new characters.

There's an interesting article from Clay Shirky
in the September Business 2.0, entitled
<a href="http://www.business2.com/content/magazine/breakthrough/2000/09/15/18549">XML: No Magic Problem Solver</a>
that I missed when it was originally published, so I wanted to comment on it now.
In essence, the article points out something I've been telling people for a long time:
XML does not relieve you of the necessity to talk to the people
you want to exchange data with to agree on the format you'll use to exchange it.
However, Shirky gets one thing in this article very, very wrong.
He actually claims that XML makes it harder to do this, not easier, and that is
completely wrong. Specifically what he says is,
</p>

<blockquote>
<strong>Sad XML Truth No. 1:</strong>
Designing a good format using XML still requires human intelligence. The
people selling XML as a tool that makes life easy are deluding their
customers�good XML takes more work because it requires a rigorous
description of the problem to be solved, and its much vaunted
extensibility only works if the basic framework is sound.

<br />&nbsp;<br />

<strong>Sad XML Truth No. 2:</strong>
XML does not mean less pain. It does not remove the pain of having to
describe your data; it simply front-loads the pain where it's easier to
see and deal with. The payoff only comes if XML is rolled out carefully
enough at the start to lessen day-to-day difficulties once the system is
up and running. Businesses that use XML thoughtlessly will face all of
the upfront trouble of implementing XML, plus all of the day-to-day
annoyances that result from improperly described data.
</blockquote>

<p>In fact, XML does mean less pain and it does require less work.
Shirky's mistake is assuming that we could somehow live without rigorous descriptions
and sound frameworks before XML existed. In fact, they were just as necessary then as now.
It's just that XML makes it a lot easier to build rigorous descriptions and sound frameworks
than when you had to start from scrtach with ASCII or (worse yet) raw bytes.
</p>

<p>
The reason XML is so widely used is that the designers of XML did a wonderful job of
solving exactly those data exchange problems that nobody cared about
and only those problems that nobody cared about. Let me explain. No one really cares
whether lines end with a carriage return or a line feed or both. No one really cares
whether fields are separated by a tab or a comma. No one really cares whether
Unicode is encoded in UTF-8 or UTF-16. All the common alternatives
are equally good. Prior to XML, however, before you could exchange data with someone,
you needed to agree on answers to these and many similar questions, none of which had anything
to do with the business case for exchanging the data. Furthermore, whatever underlying format you
eventually agreed
on (tab-delimited UTF-16 with carriage return line feed pairs separating lines or something else),
you then had to write your own tools to process that data.
</p>

<p>
Once XML enters the picture, however, all these questions are answered.
You don't care what line separator is  used. You don't care what encoding is used.
You agree that fields are separated by tags. And you use any of a variety of free tools
to parse the data. You still need to spend time talking to the organizations
you're exchanging data with to agree on what goes in the fields, what the fields are named,
and what the data means; but you had to do all that anyway before XML, and
XML doesn't make doing it any harder.
In fact XML makes it all considerably easier. As soon as you've said,
"The underlying format of our application is XML," you've answered
a lot of questions that must be answered although noone really cares
what the answer is. You can then move on to questions like
"What is the valid range of prices?" which are much more important
to the business. XML isn't a magic problem solver for all the problems of
information exchange, but it pretty magically solves 10-20% of any given problem,
and that's a significant improvement.

The IETF XML Digital Signatures Working Group
has released
RFC 3075 on <a href="ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc3075.txt">XML-Signature Syntax and Processing</a>.
  XML Signatures provide
integrity, message authentication, and/or signer authentication
services for data of any type, whether located within the XML that
includes the signature or elsewhere.
This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol. It is being jointly developed by
the IETF and the W3C. Presumably the W3C version of this draft
will be released soon. (The last W3C draft was a candidate recommendation in October
of last year.)

The W3C XML Protocol Working Group has posted the second public
 working draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-xmlp-reqs-20010319/">XML Protocol (XMLP) Requirements</a>.
 For those who haven't been following this,
 XML-RPC begat SOAP 1.0 which begat SOAP 1.1 which is
 currently pregnant with XML Protocol.
Each successive generation adds some complexity while
filling numerous holes and gaps in earlier
generations. However, they all do more or less the same thing:
allow you to make a method call to a remote system by sending
an XML document over HTTP.
</p>

<p>
I'm at the O'Reilly Java conference right now, and
XML Protocol seems to be the sleeper
subject; that is, the topic that's not actually discussed in any
sessions but is whispered
about a lot in the hallways and at lunch, by people who aren't
quite sure
what to make of it, but suspect it's going to be very important.
</p>

<p>During the course of this discussion, I had a revelation
about XML-RPC/SOAP/XML Protocol: These are all nothing like
remote procedure calls. These technologies have very little if
anything to do with RPC/RMI/CORBA/DCOM/etc.
They are neither players
nor competitors in that space. The name of the first iteration of
this
technology, XML-RPC, was misleading in that respect. Instead, what
this really is, is CGI POST. However, instead of sending the web
server an x-www-form-urlencoded query string, you send the server
an XML document. This is not a simplification of RPC. It's
a complexification of CGI! I even hinted at this in
<cite>Java Network Programming</cite>
when I noted that there was no particular reason the body of
a POST request had to contain an x-www-form-urlencoded query string,
and that it indeed could contain something else as long as you
controlled both the client and the server.
I didn't follow up on that then
or imagine that the body might be
an XML document; but now that I have realized that,
SOAP et al. make a lot more sense, and seem a lot easier to
understand and explain.

The  IETF/W3C XML Signature Working Group has released
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xml-c14n-20010315">Canonical
XML 1.0</a>. Canonical XML defines an algorithm for
converting an XML document to a sequence of bytes in such a fashion
that two documents with the same byte-for-byte canonical
form may considered to be in some sense the same.
The canonical form normalizes a number of insignificant details like attribute order, whether single or double quotes are
used to surround white space, and so forth.
Changes in the final release of this specification
are primarily editorial.
There's only one very minor substantive change dealing with
the Unicode decomposition of the Hebrew letter
YOD with HIRIQ.

The Infoset tries
to "provide a consistent set of definitions for use in other
specifications that need to
         refer to the information in a well-formed XML document".
         The big changes in this draft are the elimination of
       </p>
       <ul>
      <li>    Internal Entity Information Items</li>
<li>External Entity Information Items</li>

Formal Description</a>. According to their draft,</p>

<blockquote>
This  is a formal, declarative system for describing and
naming XML Schema information,
specifying XML instance type information,
and validating instances against schemas.
The goals of the formalization
are to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>       Provide a semantic framework for software
systems that use the W3C
XML Schema specification, such as the W3C XML Query Algebra.</li>
<li>       Specify names for <em>all</em> components of an XML Schema, so that they can
be uniquely identified by URIs. Such unique identifiers may be useful to
XML Query, RDF, and topic maps, among others.</li>
<li>       Formally define validation at a declarative level.</li>
<li>       Define the mapping from the current XML Schema syntax onto the
structures described here, as well as the mapping between the XML Schema
component mode and our component model.</li>

I'm back from XMLOne London. While there I talked about
<a href="slides/xmlonelondon2001/schemas/">schemas</a> and <a href="slides/xmlonelondon2001/xlinks/">XLinks and XPointers</a>.
I'll have the revised notes up a little later today.

I hadn't previously talked about including facets
and the changes in the March 16 Proposed Recommendations.
</p>
<p>
I apologize to those of you who wrote in to say you were worried about my absence.
I expected the conference to have much better Internet connectivity than it actually did.
In fact, without a local London dialup there was effectively no way for me to
update my web sites.
I could check my email, but only barely.
I was very disappointed that the conference did not provide a place for me to plug my laptop into so I could work while at the conference.
In the future, I'm going to be cutting down on the conference appearances I make,
and one criterion for choosing which ones
to attend is going to be the Internet access they provide.
</p>
<p>
Tomorrow I leave for the O'Reilly Java Conference in Santa Clara.
Last year the O'Reilly conference had much better Internet connectivity than any other conference I've ever been at,
so I should be able to maintain Cafe con Leche and Cafe au Lait
while there.

IBM's alphaWorks has released
<a href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/xslerator">XSLerator</a>, a tool
    written in Java       to generate XSLT style sheets from
           mappings defined using a visual
           interface.
           XSLerator supports mappings with extended
  conversion functions including iterations, conditions, joins, variables, and
  XPATH functions.
  Some knowledge of XSLT is required.

The W3C Schema Working Group has elevated their XML Schema Language
to <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/">Proposed Recommendation</a>. Changes
since the candidate
recommendation
are fairly minor and include:
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>uriReference</code> is now <code>anyURI</code></li>
<li><code>binary</code> has been replaced by  <code>hexBinary</code>
and <code>base64Binary</code>
</li>
<li>Most of the date types like <code>year</code> are now prefixed with a
<code>g</code> as in  <code>gYear</code></li>
<li>The namespace URIs are now <code>http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema</code> and
 <code>http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance</code></li>
</ul>

IBM's submitted a <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/NOTE-newline-20010314">note
with no official status</a> to the
W3C requesting that Unicode C1 control character
character #x85
NEL (new line) be redefined as white space and a line ending character in
XML documents.
It is currently allowed in XML documents but cannot appear
in tags and a few other places carriage
retruns and line feeds can appear. This is apparently
causing problems for XML parsers on OS/390 where ASCII FTP transfers
change carriage returns and linefeeds to a NEL.
</p>

<p>
This is a horrible idea, and I hope the W3C rejects it firmly.
Adopting it would break essentially every XML parser on the planet.
The proper fix for this problem is for IBM to start using real UTF-8 and
ASCII on their
systems, rather than asking the rest of the world to adapt to
 their brain damaged, non-standard software. Software that transfers XML
files to
 OS/390 (or any other)
 systems should not be rewriting it without an understanding of the syntax
of XML documents.
 Translations that treat XML documents as plain text files are bound to
cause problems.
 Any software that's not XML-aware should not attempt to change XML
documents.

The W3C Device Independence Working Group has published a last call
working draft of
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-CCPP-struct-vocab-20010315/">Composite Capability/Preference
Profiles (CC/PP): Structure and Vocabularies</a>.
This is an RDF vocabulary for describing
user agent (browser)
and proxy
          capabilities and preferences.
          Topics include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The structure of client capability and preference descriptions </li>
    <li>The structure of proxy behavior description</li>
    <li>  The use of RDF classes to distinguish different elements of a profile,
    so that a schema-aware RDF processor can handle CC/PP profiles embedded in other XML document types. </li>
</ul>

<p> The CC/PP vocabulary uses URIs to refer to specific
capabilities and preferences. It covers: </p>

<ul>
    <li>The types of values to which CC/PP attributes may refer</li>
    <li>How to introduce new vocabularies </li>
    <li>A client vocabulary covering print and display capabilities </li>
    <li>A survey of existing work from which new vocabularies may be derived. </li>

One of the problems with attending six conferences in a little over six weeks is that
it becomes very difficult to keep up with the more complex developments
in the XML world. While I was busy pouring over the XPath 2.0, XSLT 2.0, and XQuery 2.0
working drafts so I could discuss them in last week's
<a href="slides/xmloneaustin2001/cuttingedge/">Cutting Edge XML Programming</a> session,
several other people were busy trying to extend XSLT 1.0
in a different direction to allow extension functions to be written in pure XSLT.
I haven't fully digested all this work yet, but it looks interesting.
</p>

<p>
The first such effort is Jeni Tennison's <a href="http://www.jenitennison.com/xslt/exsl.html">EXSL</a>,
User-Defined Extension
Functions in XSLT. EXSL
defines extension elements and functions to support user definition of extension
                    functions using XSLT.
                    Uche Ogbuji's written an implementation for 4XSLT.
The current version is 0.1.
<p>

David Rosenborg of
Pantor Engineering AB
has counter-proposed
 <a href="http://www.pantor.com/fxpath/">Functional XPath
(FXPath)</a>. He's already
produced a sample implementation for Michael Kay's SAXON.
The current version is 0.3.

This draft  brings together in one place the color parts

Style Sheets (CSS) levels 1 and 2.
It also adds several new CSS3 properties for
opacity, ICC color profiles, and rendering intent of image content.

O'Reilly's <a href="http://software.oreilly.com/news.cfm?ID_News=200">stopping 
development</a>
of the WebSite web server for Windows, as well as the companion WebBoard product. 
They're looking for buyers for these products, but personally I don't 
see that they have
much place in a world dominated by the open source Apache web server,
which O'Reilly's done not a little to promote and even uses on many of its own
web sites. Next target for Apache: Microsoft's IIS. 
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, here's a suggestion for Tim: If you can't make a go of WebSite and 
WebBoard with a payware business model, why not open source them?
I doubt WebSite could compete effectively with Apache, even as open source, 
but there are a lot of sites (like mine) that would be very interested
in an open source WebBoard.

Jonathan Borden's updated the
<a href="http://www.rddl.org/20010305">draft specification for the
Resource Description Discovery Language</a>
(RDDL, pronounced "riddle").
According to Borden,
</p>

<blockquote>This version contains only relatively minor edits and clarifies the URL
persistence policy. The URLs for the well known natures and purposes were a
mix of http://www.rddl.org/natures and http://www.rddl.org/natures.html.
Now
only http://www.rddl.org/natures and http://www.rddl.org/purposes are
specified and should be used as these will be subdivided in subdirectories
in the future.
</blockquote>

<p>
He's also posted an RDDL

The W3C Synchronized Multimedia Working Group has posted a new working draft
of
the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/smil20/">Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL 2.0) Specification</a>.
SMIL 2.0 has two goals:
</p>
<ul>
                <li>Define an XML-based language that allows authors to write interactive multimedia presentations. Using
                SMIL 2.0, an author can describe the temporal behavior of a multimedia presentation, associate hyperlinks
                with media objects and describe the layout of the presentation on a screen. </li>
                <li>Allow SMIL to be used in other XML-based languages such as XHTML and SVG.</li>
</ul>

<p>
SMIL 2.0 is modularized, much as XHTML 1.1 is.
One of the big changes additions to this release of the spec is a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/smil20/smil-SCHEMA.html">full complement of modules
defined in XML Schemas</a>, rather than just the
DTD modules of previous working drafts.
To  the best of my knowledge, this is the first non-schema spec to make real use of the
W3C XML Schema Language.

The W3C Forms Working Group has published a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-xforms-20010216">new working draft of
XForms 1.0</a>.
XForms are a proposal for the next generation of HTML forms, with much
broader support  for platforms of varying capabilities such as desktop
computers, television sets, personal digital assistants, cell phones,
computer peripherals and even paper.
XForms can collect information that meets the constraints of various 
schema data types including:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>String </li>
	<li>Boolean </li>
	<li>Number </li>
	<li>Date </li>
	<li>Time </li>
	<li>Duration </li>
	<li>URI </li>
	<li>Binary </li>
</ul>

<p>
In adddition, it derives Currency and Monetary types from String. These
can be further constrained with facets as in schemas. Another
interesting and useful feature of XForms is a dynamic constraints
language that enables you to define integrity constraints that act over
multiple fields. For instance, "the total value of an order can be
defined in terms of a computation over other values such as unit prices,
quantities, discounts, and tax and shipping costs." The language used to
do this is XPath. Time permitting, I'm going to try to whip up a few notes on this
for my bleeding edge presentations at
either XMLOne in Austin or SDExpo West in San Jose.

Robert X. Cringely has <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/articles/op/xml/01/02/12/010212opcringely.xml">retracted</a> last week's claim, which I reported here,
that Adobe has laid off the Framemaker team. Apparently Adobe was quite demonstrative in their personal
response to him that there was nothing to the story. It may have been based on an old Internet rumor.
The furor over the alleged layoffs did bring one interesting fact to light that I was not aware of before.
According to Bob Ducharme, FrameMaker is much better at exporting XML than at importing it.
Maybe now the still-hard-at-work FrameMaker team can add this for the next release?

Bill LaForge has released version 4 of <a href="http://jxquick.sourceforge.net/">Quick</a>.
Quick is a data modeling system for Java that can generate and process XML by converting
 arbitrary object structures into trees of XML
      elements. 
   Quick works with Java Beans and Bean Property Editors. 
Changes in this release include :
</p>

<ul>
<li>QJML now serves
as both a Java Data Modeling language and as an XML binding schema. </li>
<li>Full Java
inheritance is supported in the XML schema.</li>
<li>OCM, a component system for performing complex
XML transformations. </li>
</ul>

The W3C XML Core Working Group has published the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/CR-xml-fragment-20010212">XML Fragment Interchange Candidate Recommendation</a>. 
This spec attempts to address the question of what to do with
pieces of XML documents that are not themselves complete well-formed XML documents
and may be missing key components like entity declarations, 
encoding information, default attribute values, and namespace mappings. 
The Candidate Recommendation Phase is scheduled to end April 30, 2001.

The W3C DOM Working Group
has published a new working draft of
the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-CMLS/">Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 Content Models and Load and Save Specification</a>.
The first part of this spec uses IDL to define interfaces for accessing grammars (DTDs and schemas)  
as object trees. The second part defines a platform independent means to parse and serialize XML documents.
As far as I know, no parsers have really tried to implement this yet, though the Load and Save parts are partially derived from 
ideas in JAXP. 
</p>

<p>
I'll be talking about new features in DOM3, including Content Models and Load and Save, on the last day
of the <a href="http://www.xmlconference.com/austin/">XML One Conference in Austin</a> next month. Time permitting, I may try to work 
some XML Fragment material into the session as well.

   At this time libxslt is incomplete and undoubtedly buggy,

but most standard XSLT elements work.   A few attributes are missing here and there.

The W3C has published an interesting note on
 Common User Agent Problems.  While Microsoft and Netscape compete with each other in features, they've
 more or less ignored a number of glaring problems in their browsers.
 This document  identifies myriad 
 user-interface deficiencies in common web browsers,
 most of which have been problems for years. 
 Examples include:
 </p>

<ul>
	<li>When the user follows a link to a target anchor, highlight the target location.  </li>
	<li>When the user requests to print a frameset, allow the user to select to print an individual frame or the frameset. </li>
	<li>Allow the user to add new URI schemes in a straightforward way. (Protocol handlers anyone?)</li>
	<li>When a Web resource includes metadata that may be recognized by the user agent, allow the user to view that metadata.</li>
	<li>Allow the user to bookmark negotiated resources.</li>
	<li>Respect the character set of a resource when one is explicitly given. </li>
</ul>

 
 <p>
Stated this bluntly, these are really obvious problems. 
 Perhaps this note will nudge vendors to address a few.

Several people wrote in to tell me that Adobe had <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/framemaker/fmkrelease.html">responded</a> to
<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/articles/op/xml/01/02/05/010205opcringely.xml">Cringely's article</a>. 
It's important to note, however, that
nothing in Adobe's press release actually says that Cringely was wrong.
In particular, it does not deny that Adobe laid off
the FrameMaker team. In my opinion, that missing denial is far more
suggestive than the original report. I suppose it's possible Adobe
laid off all or most of the FrameMaker team for reasons unrelated to a lack of commitment to the
product, but that seems unlikely to me.

This just corrects a few minor errors and misconceptions. Mostly it
addresses changes in the Candidate Recommendation draft that I missed on my first read-through a couple of
months ago. Most significantly, boolean properties that used to have the values 
<code>yes</code> and <code>no</code>, now have the values <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>.

Mike Olson  has released
<a href="http://services.4Suite.org/software/rdf/4XDebug">4XDebug</a>, an interactive XSLT 
debugger, and <a href="http://services.4Suite.org/software/rdf/4XProf">4XProf</a>, an XSLT profiler.
The debugger has all the typical debugger features: stepping 
through XSLT instructions, setting breakpoints, displaying arbitrary 
expressions against the current context, etc.
The profiler breaks down performance by patterns, templates, paths, portions 
of path (etc.  How long are my descendant-or-self axis specifiers taking?)

The Unicode Consortium
has published the first public working draft of 
 <a href="http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr27">Unicode 3.1</a>.
 The primary new 
 feature of Unicode 3.1 are 44,946 new characters covering 
 several historic scripts,
several sets of symbols, and many additional CJK ideographs.
For the first time, characters are encoded beyond the original 16-bit codespace or Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP or Plane 0)
in code positions of U+10000 and higher.
In particular, there are three new supplementary planes:
</p>

<dl>
       <dt>Supplementary Multilingual Plane (SMP) U+10000..U+1FFFF </dt><dd>
Historic scripts and symbols: Old Italic, Gothic, Deseret,
Byzantine Musical Symbols, (Western) Musical Symbols, and Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols
       
       </dd>
       <dt>Supplementary Ideographic Plane (SIP) U+20000..U+2FFFF </dt><dd>
       Additional unified Han ideographs known as Vertical
Extension B, comprising 42,711 characters, as well as 542 additional CJK Compatibility ideographs
       </dd>
       <dt>Supplementary Special-purpose Plane (SSP) U+E0000..U+EFFFF </dt><dd>
      97 tag characters. These duplicate the ASCII graphic characters at different code points.
      However, they indicate markup rather than text. In other words, instead of writing <code>&gt;P&lt;</code>
      to indicate a paragraph, you might just write <code>P</code>. However, you'd use the P
      at U+E0070 instead of the P at 0x50. (Note: neither XML or HTML uses this. It's intended to be used for future
      standards.)
       </dd>
</dl>

<p>
 The creators of XML specification foresaw these developments, and the
 XMlm specification is fairly compliant with these new characters.
 However, not all parsers may be compliant yet.

<a href="images/xianlarge.jpg"><img src="images/xian.gif" align=left alt="Book Cover, Peacock" 
border="0" width=127 height=190 hspace="7" vspace="5"></a>
<p>I'm pleased to announce the imminent release of
<cite><a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/xmlnut/">XML in a Nutshell</a></cite> by W. Scott Means and Elliotte
Rusty Harold (i.e. me).
This is a book a lot of developers have wanted for a long time now.
Over a year before the contract was signed, readers were
showing up at the O'Reilly booth at Internet World asking  
when <cite>XML in a Nutshell</cite> was going to be released. 
There were a few sputters and starts along the way, and like all such books multiple deadlines were missed;
but I'm pleased to announce that thousands of copies of <cite>XML in a Nutshell</cite> have rolled off the
printing press, been perfect bound, packed in cardboard boxes, and shipped to
bookstores around the world, where they should begin arriving tomorrow. 
I think you'll like it. 
</p>


<p>One of my favorite <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0764547607/o/qid%3D980116318/">comments</a> 
about <cite><a href="../bible/">The XML Bible</a></cite> came from 
a reader in Norwich England who wrote, 
"It would seem to me that if you asked the author to write 10,000 words about the colour blue,
he would be able to do it without breaking into a sweat." You know, I probably could write
10,000 words about <i>blue</i>, but I can write 
short books too, and <cite>XML in a Nutshell</cite> is the book that proves it. 
I'd estimate that it covers over twice the material that the <cite>XML Bible</cite> does
in less than half the space
and at just about half the price. 

In fact, <cite>XML in a Nutshell</cite> 
even weighs less than half what the <cite>XML Bible</cite> weighs, 
so not only will it not break your budget; it won't break your back either. 
(Whether I can write this concisely without the able aid of my coauthor W. Scott 
Means is still an open question.)
I still like the <cite>XML Bible</cite>. I think it's a good book, but even I have to
admit that I think twice before packing it in my carry-on luggage.
</p>

<p>
<cite>XML in a Nutshell</cite>, is a complete introduction to the  state of the art
in XML as of early 2001 including well-formedness, DTDs, namespaces, XLinks, XPointers, XPath, XHTML,
XSLT, <acronym title="XSL Formatting Objects">XSL-FO</acronym>, SAX2, DOM2, Unicode, and more. Very few XML books
even attempt to cover this much material, and I guarantee you that
none of them do it in this few pages. There is simply no quicker way to learn
everything you need to know about XML than by reading this book. It is the most concentrated,
cost-effective way to educate yourself about XML.
 </p>
 
<p> For those readers who've already learned everything you need to know 
 about XML, I know of no better reference to remind you of the things 
 you've forgotten. Part IV contains detailed references
 for XML, XSLT, SAX2, DOM2, XPath, and Unicode; all carefully
  designed to facilitate fast look-up
 when you just can't quite remember the name of that XSLT element
 or the exact signature of that SAX method. Before Scott and I wrote this book,
 I wasted way too much time 
 searching the specifications of XML, XSLT, DOM and more for little details like the proper namespace
 for SVG. 
 Now I just flip open <cite>XML in a Nutshell</cite>, and 
 the answers I need are right there.
 We wrote the reference work I always wanted to have. 
 </p>

<p>
Now for the bad news: bookstores have only preordered 17,000 of these.
While that sounds like a lot, more than 20,000 people a day read Cafe con Leche, 
which means bookstores are going to be caught at least a few thousand copies short,
and probably more. Amazon, in particular, always manages to underestimate the demand
for my books and sells out their initial allotment within an hour or two
of me announcing one here.
If you see that Amazon is listing it on "4-6 weeks availability" don't worry.
O'Reilly can get them more a lot faster than that.
Still, if you know you want this book, don't wait. Order it now.
It will be available very soon from any bookstore that
carries computer books including:

<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN%3D0596000588/cafeaulaitA/">Amazon</a></li>

</ul>
<p>
If you need to special order it, the ISBN number is 0-596-00058-8. 
It's $29.95, published by O'Reilly, and written by Elliotte
Rusty Harold and W. Scott Means.

The W3C XML Core Working Group has promoted
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/PR-xml-c14n-20010119">Canonical XML</a> to a  Proposed Recommendation. 
This specification describes an algorithm for generating a byte sequence from an XML document
called the <dfn>canonical form</dfn>. The canonical form normalizes a number of insignificant details 
like attribute order, whether single or double quotes are used to surround white space, and so forth.
Two XML documents with the same canonical form can be considered 
equal for all intents and purposes. 
This version is pretty much the same as the Candidate Recommendation.

<p>
How you phrase requests is sometimes important. I once heard a story about a woman who 
put up some flyers in her neighborhood advertsing, 
"For Adoption: eight cute puppies and one ugly one."
That one ugly puppy got adopted nine times! After yesterday's claim that
WML did not actually work, I finally got multiple submissions of 
photos of actual WML phones displaying 
my Hello WML example. Thanks to everyone who submitted. 
The best photo was probably this one from
Reggie Dablo:
</p>
<img src="images/hello_wml.jpg" alt="A Sprint cell phone showing the words &quot;Hello WML&quot;" 
hspace="20" width="237" height="315" />


<p>
I'm still not convinced that WML is useful or usable, or that
anyone who's not developing for it is actually using it on an even semi-regular
basis, but it is at least technologically possible. What's worst is that the WAP community seems to have
its head in the sand about usability issues. 
The Nielsen-Norman group recently did a <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20001210.html">major study</a>
pointing out the problems with WAP. The WAP Forum's <a href="http://www.wapforum.org/new/20010102244STA.htm">response</a> 
sounds to me like a desperate effort to spin the press and investors rather than a serious acknowledgement 
of the very real problems that exist. 
</p>

<p>
There are a number of ways wireless Internet access could be fixed,
 though it's not clear whether WAP/WML can be.
In rough order of short-term
feasability they are:
</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>A device with a small keypad, and a slightly larger, higher resolution screen;
  e.g. <a href="http://www.blackberry.net/">BlackBerry</a>. This would eliminate the existing problems with typing letters
   on a phone keypad. Typing in URLs like http://www.ibiblio.org/xml/wml/24-1.wml
   can be extremely difficult on a phone. In fact, I'd say anything beyond
   a three-letter airport code or a four-letter stock symbol
   is too much to ask of users on existing phones.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li><p>A device with a much larger, higher resolution screen
  and pen based input; e.g. a Palm Pilot. You can get real work done on a Palm Pilot.
  You can't on a cell phone. 
   </p>
  </li>
  <li><p>A browser that uses the one media type that's actually appropriate for
  cell phones: audio. All commands should be input via voice.
  All pages should be read to the users. This would require more CPU horsepower and memory,
  but that's coming. 
   </p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Wearable computers with gesture input and phenomenally large heads-up displays built
  into glasses or contact lenses. (<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2674533,00.html">Eye cancer</a> might 
  be a bit of a problem, though.) 
   </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>ZDNet is running an 
<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2673558,00.html">interesting story</a> 
about future cell phone developments.

The W3C has published the first public working draft of
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-css3-multicol-20010118/">Multi-column layout in CSS</a>.
This proposal defines three groups of
 new properties to support multi-column layouts in CSS3. 
  The first group sets the number and width of the columns:
  </p> 
<ul>
	<li><code>column-count </code></li>
	<li><code>column-width </code></li>
	<li><code>column-min-width </code></li>
	<li><code>column-width-policy </code></li>
</ul>

<p>Properties in the second group specify 
the amount of space and rules between columns: </p>
<ul>
	<li><code>column-gap </code></li>
	<li><code>column-rule </code></li>
	<li><code>column-rule-color </code></li>
	<li><code>column-rule-style </code></li>
	<li><code>column-rule-width </code></li>
</ul>

          <p>The third group contains a single property that lets an element span multiple columns: </p>
<ul>
	<li><code>column-span </code></li>
</ul>
</p>
<hr />
<p>
The IETF has published
<a href="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc3023.txt">RFC 3023, XML Media Types</a> by
Makoto Murata, Simon St.Laurent, and Daniel Kohn as a 
This document standardizes five new MIME
media types:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>text/xml</li>
	<li>application/xml</li>
	<li>text/xml-external-parsed-entity</li>
	<li>application/xml-external-parsed-entity</li>
	<li>application/xml-dtd</li>
</ul>

<p>This document also standardizes the
convention of 
using the suffix +xml for naming media types for specific XML applications.
For instance, RDDL documents would have the type
text/rddl+xml.  
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile M. Baker has submitted an IETF internet draft (the pre-RFC stage)
on
<a href="ftp://ftp.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-baker-xhtml-media-reg-00.txt">the 'application/xhtml+xml' Media Type</a>.
This specification also introduces a new parameter called
schema-location that would identify where the schema for this document can be found. 
For example, an HTTP server might include this 
Content-type header when returning an XHTML document:
</p>

<p><code>Content-type: application/xhtml+xml; schema-location="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-basic/xhtml-basic10.dtd"</code></p>

<p>This approach would seem to have implications beyond 
XHTML. It could easily be used to locate schemas
for any type of XML document returned over HTTP.

I am going to propose a falsifiable hypothesis: <strong>The Wireless Web does not exist.
There are many developers but no actual users.</strong> I'm hypothesizing this because 
of the 20,000 people a day who read this site, not one seems to have a cell phone 
capable of viewing  this <a href="wml/24-1.wml">most basic WML page</a>.
To falsify my hypothesis and prove me wrong all that's needed is to take 
a good picture of a real cell phone browsing that page. 
</p>

<p>
After hours of trying to load this page on my own phone, and much converstion
with my cell phone company's technical support, VoiceStream finally admitted that, contrary to what 
I was promised when I initially signed up with them, the phone they sold me
did not actually support WAP and WML. 
Then they told me to trade it in for a new phone, but they couldn't provide me with 
the model that would actually do what they had promised; and after several weeks of searching,
 it doesn't seem that 
anyone else can either. 
Several people sent me screen shots of a cell phone simulator viewing this page,
but so far not one person has actually sent in a real photograph of a real phone
displaying this page. One person tells me he tried, but that the flash on his camera
washed out the display! I feel like I'm in UFO-land here.
Everyone believes WML exists but nobody can actually prove it.

I'm still looking for a
photo of this <a href="wml/24-1.wml">Hello World</a> page on a cell phone.
Please note: I need an actual photo of a real phone. A screen capture of an emulator
is not enough. (I wonder what it says about the adoption of WML when I'm getting 
multiple submissions of emulator screenshots, but no pictures of actual phones?
I suspect it means this technology is in even worse shape than I thought.
Everyone's developing for it, but nobody's using it.)

DTDs, schemas, style sheets, and other resources for particular XML applications.
 The major change in this draft at the URL that used to be the value
 of <code>xlink:arcrole</code> is now the value of <code>xlink:role</code>,
 and <code>xlink:arcrole</code> can be used to provide  an
 additional URL further refining the role. 
 Furthermore, MIME types like text/css can now be used as 
 roles through their canonical URLs at the IETF such as
 http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/media-types/text/css.
Finally, RELAX
and TREX schemas for RDDL havve been added as one more kind 
of related resource for this document.

I have unusual request today. Would somebody with a 
WAP-enabled cell-phone and a digital camera please take a picture 
of this <a href="wml/24-1.wml">Hello World</a> page on their phone and
<a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;elharo%40metalab%2Eunc%2Eedu?Subject=WAPPicture">send it to me</a>? 
The URL is <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/xml/wml/24-1.wml">http://www.ibiblio.org/xml/wml/24-1.wml</a>
I'd do it myself, but it seems that VoiceStream's rather clueless representatives 
misinformed me about which of their phones supported WAP. </p>


<p>
This is 
for a new chapter about the Wireless Markup Language
in the second edition of the <cite>XML Bible</cite>. 
The first person to send me a usable picture
will get a free copy of the second edition of the <cite>XML Bible</cite> when published later this year.
You'll need to sign a not-particularly onerous photo permissions agreement giving IDG 
non-exclusive rights to publish the picture. The agreement doesn't promise a photo credit, but I'll
try and make sure you get one. 
Please take the picture at maximum resolution and quality, since this is intended
for print rather than a web page. Thanks!

The W3C XML Linking Working Group has pushed
the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-xptr-20010108">XPointer specification</a> back to working draft status.
The specific issue that was uncovered during
Candidate Recommendation was some <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xptr#ns-context">confusion</a> 
over how to integrate 
XPointers, particularly those in non-XML documents, with namespaces. 
</p>

<p>
It's also come to light in this draft that Sun has 
<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-xml-linking-comments/2000OctDec/0092.html">claimed a patent</a> on some of the
technologies needed to implement XPointer. I think this is particularly offensive because Eve L. Maler, a Sun employee, served as 
co-chair of the XML Linking Working Group
and a co-editor of the XPointer specification. 
As usual Sun wants to use this as a club 
to lock implementers and users into a licensing agreement that goes beyond what Sun and the W3C could otherwise demand. 
The specific patent
is <a href="http://164.195.100.11/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1='5,659,729'.WKU.&amp;OS=PN%2F5,659,729&amp;RS=PN%2F5,659,729">United States Patent 
No. 5,659,729, Method and system for implementing hypertext scroll attributes</a>,
issued to Jakob Nielsen in 1997. 
The patent was filed on February 1, 1996. It claims:
</p>
<blockquote>
Embodiments of the present invention use a new extension to the HTML language to support remotely specified named
anchors. A remotely specified named anchor, when embedded within a source document, instructs a browser program to
access a portion of a destination document indicated in the remotely specified named anchor. When the browser program
reads a remotely specified named anchor such as &lt;a href=http://foo.com/bar.html/SCROLL="Some Text"&gt; from the source
document, the browser program performs the following steps: 1) the browser retrieves the destination file "bar.html"
from the server "foo.com", 2) the browser searches the file bar.html for "Some Text", and 3) if the browser finds the
character swing being searched for, then the browser displays the file bar.html, scrolled to the line containing the first
character of the character string being searched for. 
</blockquote>

<p>
It's very questionable whether this is truly an original invention with no prior art.
HyperCard and Xanadu both had capabilities like this.
It's also questionable whether the patent as written really applies to XPointer.
For instance, the patent mandates a certain behavior of browsers.
XPointer doesn't.
I also think that the proposed 
"XPointer patent terms and conditions" are unenforceable as currently published. 
Last Call on this draft
ends January 29,  2001. I recommend complete rejection of this specification until
such time as Sun's patent can be dealt with more reasonably.

James Clark of XSLT fame
has thrown his hat into the ring
for developers of XML Schema languages.
According to Clark,
<a href="http://www.thaiopensource.com/trex/">TREX (Tree Regular Expressions for XML)</a>
is "basically the type system of XDuce with an XML syntax and with a
bunch of additional features (like support for attributes and
namespaces) needed to make it a practical language for structure
validation. Of existing Schema languages, it's closest to RELAX. It's
not tied to any particular datatyping language; rather, the idea is that
you can plug whatever datatyping language you want".

Multiple competing proposals for
an XML Catalog syntax are being posted on xml-dev every day.
 The goal is to come up with something reasonably extensible and indirect to place
on the other end of namespace URIs.
Sean Palmer's posted a proposal for  XML Namespace Gloss,
<a href="http://infomesh.net/2001/01/xngloss/">XNGloss</a>. 
Most recently Jonathan Borden and
Tim Bray have combined forcces for
 the <a href="http://www.openhealth.org/RDDL/">Resource Directory
Description Language (RDDL)</a>.
According to Borden,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
A Resource Directory provides a text description of some class of resources
and of other resources related to that class. It also contains a directory
of links to these related resources. An example of a class of resources is
that defined by an XML Namespace. Examples of such related resources include
schemas, stylesheets, and executable code. A Resource Directory Description
is designed to be suitable for service as the body of a resource returned by
deferencing a URI serving as an XML Namespace name.
</p>

<p>
The Resource Directory Description Language is an extension of XHTML Basic
1.0 with a new element named resource. This element serves as an XLink to
the referenced resource.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Everybody's copying the ideas they like from everybody else, so it's hard to keep track of
who's doing what. However, there does seem to be some real disagreement about
both functionality and syntax, so there are some real differences between the various proposals. 
</p>

<p>
Howard Katz's <a href="http://www.fatdog.com/">XML Query Engine</a>
v0.92 is a JavaBean that lets you index and search XML documents
for element, attribute, and full-text content. The query language is
a draft form of XQL, which is close to a subset of XPath. 
XML Query Engine extends XQL's
syntax to provide a full-text search. 
Licensing remains to be worked out, but it's not open source. 
At least for the moment, it's free-beer.

Happy New Year! Happy New Millennium! May this one find you well.
Today I thought I'd update you on my progress on last year's New Year's resolutions for
Cafe au Lait/Cafe con Leche.
</p>

<dl>
	<dt>1. I will move these sites onto their own dedicated 
	Linux boxes and 24/7 net connections so I won't be limited by what the
	system administrators are willing to install. 
	<dd> 
	It took most of last year to get
	 the physical infrastructure in place. However, that has now been accomplished.
	 My SDSL line is installed and running, and I've got a spanking-new Qube 3 ready to go.
	I've also purchased the domain names cafeaulait.org and 
	cafeconleche.org. I'm going to be spending today trying to get 
	the Web server working like I want. I'll be moving pages over one-at-a-time to the new
	system, starting with the least popular pages so I can work out the inevitable glitches.
	I expect this to be my major project for the next month or so. <p>
    </dd>
	
	<dt>2. I will establish a database back end for this site. No more 
	editing the HTML pages manually!
	<dd> 
	Once I've figured out how to get the Qube to serve static pages to the world, I'll start
	using MySQL and PHP. I think I'll begin by porting the mailing lists pages and the 
	books pages from FileMaker Pro to MySQL. Then I can begin moving the daily news into a database
	backed system.<p>
	</dd>
	
	<dt>3. I will get discussion forums working on this site. I'm tired of reading 
	all the interesting responses I get in my email and not being able to share them
	with you. 
	<dd> 
	I'm still looking at this. I may try using <a href="http://www.phpnuke.org/">PHPNuke</a>, or I may try to roll
	my own using MySQL and PHP. But it's still on my ToDo list. <p>
	</dd>
	
	<dt>4. I will get Prentice Hall to honor their contract reverting the rights to the 
	<cite><a href="books/jdr/">Java Developer's Resource</a></cite>
	to me. Once that's done, I will update the book to Java 2, and post the entire 
	text here on Cafe au Lait.
	<dd> 
	 This was my biggest success. I do have the rights back to the <cite><a href="books/jdr/">Java Developer's Resource</a></cite>
	 and I have begun to post <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/javafaq/books/jdr/chapters/">updated chapters</a>. 
	 Much work remains to be done to bring the entire book
	 up to spec with the current incarnation of Java. <p>
	</dd>
	
	<dt>5. I will get the rights back to 
	<cite><a href="books/secrets/">Java Secrets</a></cite>
	as well, update it, and post it here on Cafe au Lait.
	<dd>
	 I also got the rights back to <a href="books/secrets/">Java Secrets</a></cite>.
	 I haven't had time to update it yet. However, since it isn't nearly as out-of-date as the
	 <cite>Java Developer's Resource</cite>. I think maybe I should just take a quick look at it
	 and post the unupdated files. I would need a good conversion tool to move Word documents
	 to HTML. <p>

	<dt>2. I will establish a database back end for this site. No more 
	editing the HTML pages manually!
	<dd> 
	Once I've figured out how to get the Qube to serve static pages to the world, I'll start
	using MySQL and PHP. I think I'll begin by porting the mailing lists pages and the 
	books pages from FileMaker Pro to MySQL. Then I can begin moving the daily news into a database
	backed system.<p>
	</dd>
	
	<dt>3. I will get discussion forums working on this site. I'm tired of reading 
	all the interesting responses I get in my email and not being able to share them
	with you. 
	<dd> 
	I'm still looking at this. I may try using <a href="http://www.phpnuke.org/">PHPNuke</a>, or I may try to roll
	my own using MySQL and PHP. But it's still on my ToDo list. <p>
	</dd>
	
	<dt>4. I will get Prentice Hall to honor their contract reverting the rights to the 
	<cite><a href="books/jdr/">Java Developer's Resource</a></cite>
	to me. Once that's done, I will update the book to Java 2, and post the entire 
	text here on Cafe au Lait.
	<dd> 
	 This was my biggest success. I do have the rights back to the <cite><a href="books/jdr/">Java Developer's Resource</a></cite>
	 and I have begun to post <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/javafaq/books/jdr/chapters/">updated chapters</a>. 
	 Much work remains to be done to bring the entire book
	 up to spec with the current incarnation of Java. <p>
	</dd>
	
	<dt>5. I will get the rights back to 
	<cite><a href="books/secrets/">Java Secrets</a></cite>
	as well, update it, and post it here on Cafe au Lait.
	<dd>
	 I also got the rights back to <a href="books/secrets/">Java Secrets</a></cite>.
	 I haven't had time to update it yet. However, since it isn't nearly as out-of-date as the
	 <cite>Java Developer's Resource</cite>. I think maybe I should just take a quick look at it
	 and post the unupdated files. I would need a good conversion tool to move Word documents
	 to HTML. <p>
	</dd>
