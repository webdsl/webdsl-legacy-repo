Standards discussed include CSS, XSLT, XSL-FO, DTDs, XLinks,SAX, and DOM. It shows you brief examples of each of these and explains boththeir intended purpose and their practical usesso you can intelligently decidewhich ones you need to work with and which ones you can safely ignore.After you've attended this seminar, you'll know what all the different XML technologiesand tools are, and be able to decide when they are and are not appropriate foryour web sites and applications.</p></dd><dt><a href="sd2006west/xmlfundamentals/">XML Fundamentals</a> </dt><dt><a href="sd2002west/introxml/">Intro to XML</a> </dt><dd></dd><dt><a href="sd2000east/basics/">XML Basics</a> </dt><dd><p>XML is a simple, flexible format that allows you to designmarkup languages to fit your documents rather than theone-size-fits-all approach of HTML. XML is suitable not only forWeb pages, but also for printed documentation, application fileformats, and data interchange between applications. This talkdiscusses what XML can do for your programs and Web sites. Init, you'll learn how to write well-formed XML documents anddisplay them on Web sites using CSS style sheets. This talkassumes basic familiarity with HTML and the Web but no priorknowledge of XML.</p></dd><dt><a href="albany/syndication/">RSS, Atom, APP, and All That</a> </dt><dd><p>XML based syndication is moving from its foundations in weblogs to unexpected arenas: source code control systems, audio narrowcasts, e-mail, bug tracking, stock tickers, and more. News readers like Vienna, NetNewsWire, RSSOwl, and Newsgator are replacing classic web browsers for many uses. This session explores the fundamental technologies underlying this explosion of content: the various versions of RSS, OPML, Atom, and the Atom Publishing Protocol. Learn the tricks and techniques for integrating these XML applications into your products as both clients and servers.</p></dd><dt><a href="albany/effective/">Effective XML</a> </dt><dd><p>Six years after XML 1.0 was released, the community is finally beginning to understand which practices work and which ones don't. This talk explores patterns (and quite a few anti-patterns) common in XML development, and explains which are which, and why. You'll learn as many specific ways to improve your XML systems as we can cram into 90 minutes. </p></dd> <dt><a href="sd2006west/testingxml/">Testing XML</a> </dt><dd><p>More and more applications are generating XML documents as their primary or secondary outputs. XML is much easier to parse than traditional formats. At the same time, it has a number of syntactic options that make testing output more difficult than testing traditional, less rich formats. Simple string comparison is often too naive to properly test XML. This talk explores the challenges and pitfalls of testing XML documents. It explains what to look for when testing XML documents and even more importantly what to ignore. We'll consider various tools for testing XML including parsers, schemas, DTDs, canonical XML, and XPath. Finally, we'll discuss automating tests by writing JUnit test cases that use various XML APIs such as DOM to compare the actual output to the expected output.</p></dd><dt><a href="sd2005west/xforms/">XForms</a> </dt><dd><p>Despite all the advances made on the Web in the last decade+, forms have changed little since Mosaic 1.0. We now have JavaScript to give them a little intelligence, and browsers can sometimes autofill a few fields, but otherwise they present the same basic interface they did ten years ago. The wait for better user interfaces is over. XForms are a radically more powerful forms technology for the Web that enables separation of presentation and content, data type aware input fields, enhanced accessibility for users, far richer user interface widgets, and much, much more. Learn how you can take advantage of XForms to build the next generation of killer web apps. </p></dd><dt><a href="sd2006west/relaxng/">RELAX: Schemas Don't Have to be Hard</a> </dt><dd><p>Do DTDs bore you? Does the W3C XML Schema Language drive you to tears? Rejoice, because an alternative is here. RELAX NG is a new international standardschema language that's based on powerful mathematics but simple enough for math-phobics to use. It provides the 80% of features developers actually need from schemas at about 20% of the complexity. And it can do a few things the  W3C XML Schema Language can't. In 90 minutes you can learn to do with RELAX NG what would take a full day of training in the W3C XML Schema Language. </p></dd><dt><a href="weekend/xquery/">XQuery</a> </dt><dd><p> XQuery is a new fourth generation language being designed at the W3C to extract information from collections of XML documents, including those stored in native XML databases. It is based on XPath 2.0, but features a more familiar, procedural syntax than XSLT. This talk explores XQuery 1.0, shows you when it's appropriate and where you can use it. You'll learn both the syntax and semantics of this powerful new language. </p></dd> <dt><a href="albany/xom/">XOM Makes XML Easier</a>  </dt><dd><p>	It is generally recognized that the standard APIs for processing XML	have their drawbacks. SAX, though efficient, is hard to use, and DOM	can be just plain ugly.	XOM is a new XML object model developed by Elliotte Rusty Harold. It	is an open source (LGPL), tree-based, streaming API for processing XML	that strives for correctness and simplicity while still being able to	process documents of arbitrary size and complexity.  XOM	implementations are available for Java and Python.	In this 90 minute presentation, Elliotte will explain the philosophy	behind XOM and give some demonstrations of how it boosts	productivity and leads to cleaner, more understandable code for XML	processing.</p></dd><dt><a href="sd2004west/stax/">StAX</a> </dt><dd><p>StAX, the Streaming API for XML, is a new pull parsing API for processing XML with Java. Unlike traditional, SAX based push parsers, pull parsers put your application in charge of the program. You drive the processing rather than being driven by it. Nonetheless, you get all the speed and size advantages of a streaming API. This class explores the design patterns common in pull parsing. Learn how you can integrate pull-parsing into your application chains, and more importantly whether you should.</p></dd><dt><a href="sd2000east/dtds/">DTDs</a> </dt><dd><p>XML based markup languages are described with Document TypeDefinitions (DTDs). This seminar shows you how to document yourown XML applications using DTDs. You'll learn how to declareelements, attributes, and entities; how to validate documentsagainst DTDs; and how to organize your DTDs in a clear,maintainable, and reusable fashion.</p></dd><dt><a href="sd2006west/schemas/">Schemas</a> </dt><dd><p>One of the most common complaints about DTDs is that they don't allow authorsto specify constraints on the element and attribute content. For instance,they do not let you say that a <code>MONTH</code> element contains an integerbetween 1 and 12. Schemas fill this gap in the XML family. They also fill many otherholes left by DTDs; among them inheritance, data typing, and namespace-aware validation.This talk introduces you to the W3C's new XML schema language, and shows you how to use itto make validation far more powerful. </p></dd><dt><a href="sd2002east/xlinks/">XLinks and XPointers</a> </dt><dd><p>Without links, HTML would be just another document  format. Without links it could never have created the Web.   And yet until quite recently XML has been lacking any  similar facility. The wait, however, is over. This talk  introduces XLinks and XPointers, the two main proposals for  making XML not just text but hypertext. You'll learn how to use  XLinks and XPointers to build hypertext systems far more  sophisticated than anything that's possible with HTML. </p></dd><dt><a href="xmlone/london2002/namespaces/">Namespaces</a> </dt><dd><p>Namespaces are one of the most fundamental yet widely misunderstood factorsin the XML equation. They do both more and less than many people expect of them.This talk shows you how to use namespaces in both new and existing XML applications,including how to integrate them with DTDs and schemas.   </p></dd><dt><a href="sd2003west/handsonxslt/">Hands-On XSLT</a></dt><dd><p>The Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) includes a very powerfuldeclarative language for transforming XML documents into new XMLdocuments called XSLT. XSLT has many applications includingelectronic commerce and Web page display. In this talk you'll write XSL stylesheets that can change XML to HTML,sort data, extract subsets of the data, and otherwise manipulateand massage data for display to the end user.</p></dd><dt><a href="sd2003west/xmlpull/">XML Pull Parsing</a></dt><dd><p>XMLPULL is a new, extremely fast streaming API for reading XML documentsthat can handle arbitrarily large documents without many of thecomplexities of SAX. This pull-based API has the potential to be as easyto use as tree-based APIs like DOM and JDOM while being as fast andmemory efficient as push-based APIs like SAX. Although its API is verydifferent than either SAX or DOM, XMLPULL is fully conformant with allrelevant XML standards. It supports well-formedness checking,validation, namespaces, and even schemas. Learn how you can integratepull-parsing into your applications and systems.</p></dd><dt><a href="sd2004west/dom3/">DOM Level 3</a></dt><dd><p>DOM Level 3 is the next generation of thepopular Document Object Model language and parser independent API for reading and writing XML and HTML documents. DOM3 adds standard means of locating a parser, creating a new document, and accessing DTDs and schemas. It also fill a number of holes in existing DOM interfaces such as <code>Element</code> and <code>Node</code>.  Attendees should already be familiar with the DOM2 Core API. </p></dd><dt><a href="xmlonesanjose2001/xinclude/">XInclude</a> </dt><dd><p>XInclude is a radical new way of building large XML documents outof smaller component parts. Unlike competing technologies such as general entity references and XLinks,all the parts are fully usable by themselves as well as when merged with themaster document. Indeed one part can be used in many different documents. XInclude encourages modular and reusable development of web sites, book,and information systems. This talk completely covers XInclude syntax.Several different implementations are presented using a variety of APIs,and the strengths and weaknesses of each are elaborated.</p></dd><dt><a href="sd2004west/xslt/">XSL Transformations</a>  </dt><dd><p>The Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) includes a very powerfuldeclarative language for transforming XML documents into new XMLdocuments called XSLT. XSLT has many applications includingelectronic commerce and Web page display. In this talk you'lllearn how to write XSL stylesheets that can change XML to HTML,sort data, extract subsets of the data, and otherwise manipulateand massage data for display to the end user.</p></dd><dt><a href="jaoo99/hypevshope/">XML: Hype vs. Hope</a> </dt><dd><p>XML is the most hyped technology since Java. It's been touted as an almost universal technology that will replace HTML, JavaBeans, UML, EDI, relationaldatabases, petroleum products, and sliced bread. Clearly that's an exaggeration;but how much of the hype is really accurate and how much is just vapor?In this talk you'll find out just what XML really is and what it can (and can't) do. </p></dd><dt><a href="http://www.cafeaulait.org/slides/eclipseworld2005/xmlediting/">XML Editing with Eclipse</a> </dt><dd><p>More and more software development work requires handling XML.Everything from Ant build files to WSDL documents describing networkservices are implemented as XML. Test cases and output can often be mostconveniently stored as XML. The default install of Eclipse includes arudimentary XML editor. Third party plug-ins add much more sophisticatedediting abilities, as well as other tools such as XSL transformers,schema validators, schema editors, and more. This session willdemonstrate the latest plug-ins for working with XML in Eclipse.</p></dd><dt><a href="sd2003west/xmlandjava/">Processing XML with Java</a> </dt><dd><p>XML is a flexible meta-language that allows you to design markuplanguages to fit your documents rather than theone-size-fits-all approach of HTML. XML is suitable not only forWeb pages, but also for application file formats, objectserialization, and data interchange between applications. Thistutorial will show you how to use Java to process XML documentsand show you why you might want to do that.</p><p> The session beginswith a quick review of XML syntax. However we'll look at it fromthe perspective of a programmer using XML as an output format.XML files are text files so you'll explore how Java outputs textusing Writers and how to use these classes to write XML. Thenyou'll see some demonstrations of the conversion of existingdata formats to XML. </p><p>Of course writing data is only half of theI/O equation so next you'll learn how to read XML documents fromJava. Input is considerably more complicated than output.Fortunately 90% of the work can be done for you by free parserslike the Apache Project's Xerces. You'll see how to use thestandard, event based Simple API for XML (SAX) to drive your ownprograms through callbacks. </p><p>Most parsers also support a moreobject oriented view of an XML document by implementing theW3C's Document Object Model (DOM). You'll investigate the DOM indepth, see how it compares to SAX, and learn which API isappropriate for which tasks. </p></dd><dt><a href="xmlonesanjose2001/advancedxml/">Advanced XML/The Bleeding Edge of XML</a> </dt><dd><p>This one day tutorial is not for the faint of heart. We're goingto run right up to the bleeding edge of today's XML technology,and then we're going to keep on going. This tutorial is fordevelopers who have already mastered the basics of XML, DTDs,and namespaces and are looking for the next level. We'll beexploring the latest W3C and third party extensions to XMLdefinitely including:</p><ul>	<li>The XML Infoset</li>	<li>XLinks</li>	<li>XPointers</li>	<li>Schemas</li></ul><p>We'll also take some time to explore some technologiesa little further out on and even pastthe bleeding edge, possibly including: </p><ul>	<li>XML Query Languages</li>	<li>XInclude</li>	<li>JDOM</li>	<li>DOM3</li></ul><p>However, we're going to leave the exact list of topics openright up until the day of the show so we can give you thefreshest, most up-to-date coverage we can, very likely includinga few things that haven't even been invented yet. This tutorialshows you not only where XML is and what you can do with ittoday, but also where it's going and what you'll be able to dowith it tomorrow. If you want to get a leg up on yourcompetitors by understanding tomorrow's technology today, thisis the talk for you.</p></dd><dt><a href="xmloneaustin2001/cuttingedge/">Cutting Edge XML Programming</a> </dt><dd><p>This seminar is not for the faint of heart. We're goingto run right up to the bleeding edge of today's XML technology,and then we're going to jump off. This tutorial is forprogrammers who have already mastered SAX and DOM and are looking for the next level. We'll beexploring the latest W3C and third party APIs and standardsfor processing  XML including:the XML Infoset, 	Canonical XML,     XML Digital Signatures, 	DOM Level 3, 	XBase, 	XInclude, and	XPointers.</p></dd><dt><a href="sd2005west/saxdom/">Processing XML with SAX and DOM</a> </dt><dd><p> This tutorial will showsyou how to use Java toprocess XML documents and show you why you might want to do that.XML files are text files so you'll explore how Java outputs textusing Writers and how to use these classes to write XML.

It also compares and contrasts JDOM with the existing SAX and DOM APIs to help you choose which API to use for which projects. </p></dd><dt><a href="xmlone/amsterdam2001/hypertext/">XML Hypertext</a>  </dt><dd><p>Without links, HTML would have been just another documentformat. Without links it could never have created the World WideWeb. And yet until quite recently XML has been lacking anysimilar facility. The wait, however, is over. This talkintroduces XLinks, XPointers, XInclude, and XML Base, the technologies that enable you to make XML not just text but hypertext. You'll learn how to put these all together to build hypertext systems far moresophisticated than anything that's possible with HTML.</p></dd><dt><a href="sd2003west/xslt2/">XSLT 2.0 and Beyond</a>  </dt><dd><p>XSLT 1.0 has been one of the biggest success stories in the XML family.It's solved a lot of problems developers didn't even know they haduntil they saw what XSLT could do. This talk explores the future of querying and transforming XML documents including new XSLT elements such as <code>xsl:document</code>, extension functions written in XSLT,a new version of XPath that can query remote documentsand use functions in location paths, and a whole new languagecalled XQuery, a fourth-generation languagefor extracting data from XML documents and using thatdata to produce new XML documents. </p></dd></dl><h2>By Venue</h2><p>If you attended a particular presentation, and want the notesfrom a specific talk on a specific day, you'll find them here.
