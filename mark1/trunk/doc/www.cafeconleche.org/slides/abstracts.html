The duration of most of these talks can be expanded or contracted as necessaryto fit your needs. </p><p>If you'd like me to speak at your conference or to your companyor user group, just drop an email to me at <ahref="mailto:elharo@metalab.unc.edu?subject=speaking%20engagement">elharo@metalab.unc.edu</a> and we'll see what wecan set up. I'm based in New York, but I do travel quite a bit.I also do a lot of <ahref="/javafaq/slides/abstracts.html">speaking about Java</a> aswell. I'm constantly developing new presentations on a varietyof subjects related to XML, Java, and the Web so if there's aparticular topic you'd like to hear me pontificate about, feelfree to ask.  </p><p>Available presentations described in more detail below include:</p><ul>  <li>Introductory sessions suitable for people with no prior knowledge of XML:  <ul>	<li>A Brief Intro to XML</li>	<li>XML Fundamentals</li>	<li>XML Basics</li>	<li>An Overview of XML</li>	<li>Intro to XML full-day tutorial</li>	<li>Hands On XML two day class</li></ul>  </li>  <li>Intermediate level seminars on a variety of special topics for   people familiar with XML basics:  <ul>	<li>RSS, Atom, OPML, and All That</li>	<li>Testing XML</li>	<li>XSL Transformations</li>	<li>Cookies Are Bad For You</li>	<li>Effective XML</li>	<li>RELAX NG</li>	<li>XForms</li>	<li>Schemas</li>	<li>DTDs</li>	<li>Namespaces</li>	<li>SAX</li>	<li>XMLPULL</li>	<li>StAX</li>	<li>DOM</li>	<li>DOM 3</li>	<li>JDOM</li>	<li>XInclude</li>	<li>XLinks</li>	<li>XML Hypertext</li>	<li>XSLT 2.0 and Beyond</li></ul>  </li>  <li>Half-day and full-day tutorials that focus on intermediate and expert techniques  for processing XML with Java:   <ul>	<li>Processing XML with Java (covers SAX, DOM, and JDOM)</li>	<li>Processing XML with SAX and DOM</li>	<li>Advanced XML (a.k.a. The Bleeding Edge of XML)</li>	<li>Cutting Edge XML Programming</li></ul>  </li></ul><h2>Introductory Sessions</h2><p>These sessions all cover more or less the same material.The main difference is the amount of time they take, and thus the amountof depth that can be gone into on specific topics.The first two, <cite>A Brief Intro to XML</cite> and <cite>An Overview of XML</cite>,concentrate on explaining what all the pieces of the XML puzzle are and how they fit together.These are very high level talks that emphasize breadth over depth.After hearing one of them, I'd expect that attendees know what XML is and what it's used for, know what DTDs and schemas areand what they're used for, know the different choices of APIs that are available for processing XML documents,and so forth. However, students would not have a great deal of facility in actually producing these things.</p><p><cite>XML Basics</cite> is a more technical, syntax-heavy talk that focuses on teaching students how to write well-formed XML documents that use namespaces and CSS style sheets.Less emphasis is placed on more advanced topics like DTDs, schemas, and XSLT,though these can all be covered in separate sessions if desired.<cite>XML Fundamentals</cite> is an expanded (twice as long)version of XML Basics that has the time to add DTDs and XSLT.Finally, <cite>Intro to XML</cite> is a full-day, nitty-grittytechnical session that has time to cover all of thisin much more detail.  It's also available as a two-day hands-on session with exercises. </p><h3><a href="columbia">A Brief Intro to XML</a> (1 hour)</h3><p>XML, the Extensible Markup Language, has been adopted in realms as diverseas human resources, object serialization, genealogy, and music. This high-level overview shows you how you might use XML in your ownareas of interest. Standards discussed include CSS, XSLT, XSL-FO, DTDs, XLinks,SAX, and DOM. It shows you brief examples of each of these and explains boththeir intended purpose and their practical usesso you can intelligently decidewhich ones you need to work with and which ones you can safely ignore.After you've attended this seminar, you'll know what all the different XML technologiesand tools are, and be able to decide when they are and are not appropriate foryour web sites and applications.</p><p>This talkassumes basic familiarity with HTML and the Web but no priorknowledge of XML. It's suitable for anyone who wants to know just what the XML hype is really all about includingweb site designers, programmers, IT Managers, and CEOs. </p><h3><a href="hoffman/fundamentals/">An Overview of XML</a> (2 hours)</h3><h3><a href="sd2000east/basics/">XML Basics</a> (1.5 hours)</h3><p>XML is a simple, flexible format that allows you to designmarkup languages to fit your documents rather than theone-size-fits-all approach of HTML. XML is suitable not only forWeb pages, but also for printed documentation, application fileformats, and data interchange between applications. This talkdiscusses what XML can do for your programs and Web sites. Init, you'll learn how to write well-formed XML documents anddisplay them on Web sites using CSS style sheets. This talkassumes basic familiarity with HTML and the Web but no priorknowledge of XML.</p><h3><a href="xmloneaustin2001/introxml/">XML Fundamentals</a> (3 hours)</h3><p>XML is a simple, flexible meta-language for creating markup languagesdescribing particular documents or domains. Fifth generation browserslike Internet Explorer 5 and Mozilla can view XML pages directly, butthat's not XML's only use. XML can also be used to define formats forprinted documentation, files saved by programs, and data interchangebetween applications. XML is already being used in areas as diverse asmathematical notation, object serialization, vector graphics,meta-information, and more.<p>This tutorial will show you how to use a variety of free tools, todesign XML-based markup languages, write XML documents, validate thedocuments against DTDs, format those documents with style sheets, anddeliver them to end users.<p>The tutorial gets under way by exploring well-formed XML documents.We'll introduce elements and attributes, discuss when each isappropriate, and show how you can use them to divide data and documentsinto a tree of XML elements. You'll learn how style sheets that allowyou to separate the organization of your data from its presentation, andeven provide different views of the same data or document to differentreaders. We'll begin with the simpler CSS style sheets, then move on tothe more complex and powerful XSL language.<p>Then we'll introduce DTDs to impose additional constraints on the form adocument takes. You'll learn how to write DTDs that declare and organizethe various elements and attributes used in your document, how to planthe structure of a document in advance, and how to use entities declaredin the DTD to assemble a document from multiple smaller documents.<p>Outline:<ul>       <li>Well-formed XML       <li>DTDs       <li>XSLT</ul><p>Prerequisites:<br />Students should have at least a user's understanding of the Internet,and be comfortable writing basic HTML.</p><h3><a href="sd2000west/introxml/">Intro to XML Tutorial</a> (1 day)</h3><p>XML is a simple, flexible meta-language for creating markuplanguages describing particular documents or domains.

Fifthgeneration browsers like Internet Explorer 5 and Mozilla canview XML pages directly, but that's not XML's only use. XML canalso be used to define formats for printed documentation, filessaved by programs, and data interchange between applications.XML is already being used in areas as diverse as mathematicalnotation, object serialization, vector graphics,meta-information, and more.</p><p>This tutorial will show you how to use a variety of free tools,to design XML-based markup languages, write XML documents,validate the documents against DTDs, format those documents withstyle sheets, and deliver them to end users.</p><p>The tutorial gets under way by exploringwell-formed XML documents.

Finally, we'll see how sophisticated hypertext linking can be added to XML documents and applications using XLinks and XPointers.</p><h3 >Outline:</h3><ul><li>Why XML's Exciting<li>Well Formed XML<li>CSS<li>DTDs and Validity	<li>Namespaces	<li>XSL Transformations	<li>XLinks	<li>XPointers</ul><h4 >Prerequisites: </h4><p>This tutorial assumes basic familiarity with HTML and the Webbut no prior knowledge of XML and no knowledge of any specificprogramming language. </p><h4 >Class Materials</h4><p>Attendees must bring a laptop they're comfortable using to develop software, including theirchoice of text editor and Web browser.Supported operating systems include Windows 95 and later,a reasonably modern build of Linux, and MacOS X.Attendees should have the Java Development Kit 1.4 or later installed prior to class. Other necessary software will be provided on both CD-ROM and a local network server. Open source software is used wherever possible, and no payware is required.  The laptop must have an Ethernet card, and be configured to support DHCP. CD-ROM and floppy drives wouldn't hurt either, but are not absolutely required. Power strips will be provided so don't forget your power cord.  One or more assistants will be available to help you get connected to the network, and show you how to use the software provided in class; but in general we won't be able to troubleshoot problems related to your  specific laptop (e.g. inability to get the JDK installed). </p><h2>Special Topics</h2><p>These are all seminars thatcover one particular part of XML in depth. Available topics include <cite>XQuery</cite>, <cite>XOM</cite>, <cite>JDOM</cite>,<cite>DTDs</cite>, <cite>Schemas</cite>, <cite>XSLT</cite>, <cite>Namespaces</cite>, <cite>SAX</cite>, and <cite>DOM</cite>. </p><h3><a href="albany/xom/">XOM</a> (approximately 1.5 hours)</h3><p>	It is generally recognized that the standard APIs for processing XML	have their drawbacks. SAX, though efficient, is hard to use, and DOM	can be just plain ugly.	XOM is a new XML object model developed by Elliotte Rusty Harold. It	is an open source (LGPL), tree-based, streaming API for processing XML	that strives for correctness and simplicity while still being able to	process documents of arbitrary size and complexity.  XOM	implementations are available for Java and Python.	In this 90 minute presentation, Elliotte will explain the philosophy	behind XOM and give some demonstrations of how it boosts	productivity and leads to cleaner, more understandable code for XML	processing.</p><h3><a href="acgnj/syndication/">RSS, Atom, APP, and All That: a Course for Developers</a> (approximately 1.5 hours)</h3><p>XML based syndication is moving from its foundations in weblogs to unexpected arenas: source code control systems, audio narrowcasts, e-mail, bug tracking, stock tickers, and more. News readers like Vienna, NetNewsWire, RSSOwl, and Newsgator are replacing classic web browsers for many uses. This session explores the fundamental technologies underlying this explosion of content: the various versions of RSS, OPML, Atom, and the Atom Publishing Protocol. Learn the tricks and techniques for integrating these XML applications into your products as both clients and servers.</p><h3><a href="sd2006west/testingxml/">Testing XML</a> (approximately 1.5 hours)</h3><p>More and more applications are generating XML documents as their primary or secondary outputs. XML is much easier to parse than traditional formats. At the same time, it has a number of syntactic options that make testing output more difficult than testing traditional, less rich formats. Simple string comparison is often too naive to properly test XML. This talk explores the challenges and pitfalls of testing XML documents. It explains what to look for when testing XML documents and even more importantly what to ignore. We'll consider various tools for testing XML including parsers, schemas, DTDs, canonical XML, and XPath. Finally, we'll discuss automating tests by writing JUnit test cases that use various XML APIs such as DOM to compare the actual output to the expected output.</p><h3>The XML Stack</h3><p>XML processing can be divided into four layers: binary, lexical, syntactic, and semantic. However, these layers are rarely recognized; and many APIs, tools, and programs mix them together, resulting in much needless confusion. This talk explains how to cleanly separate XML processing into distinct layers, such that each layer only talks to the ones below and above it in the stack, and each tool operates only on the information in one layer. It explains which XML constructs belong to which layers and where different kinds of programs need to operate. The result are much cleaner, much simpler, much more robust programs, APIs, and specifications. </p><h3>The Semantic Web: Hype, Hope, or Hysteria?</h3><p>The vision of semi-intelligent agents seamlessly creating knowledge by combining diverse sources has driven the W3C for the last six years, but will it actually work? Is there a killer app, or is the SemWeb doomed to be yet another AI fantasy? This talk explores the Semantic Web Vision and specific technologies that underlay it including RDF and OWL. Is RDF the magic bullet for enterprise integration? Is OWL going to make the 80/20 cut for AI that HTTP and HTML made for Hypertext? Or is this all just the product of a bunch of pointy-haired academics who've spent too much time reading Hegel and too little time studying the real world?  Find out whether RDF and OWL are right for you (or perhaps whether they're right for anyone.)</p><h3><a href="sd2005west/xforms/">XForms</a></h3><p>Despite all the advances made on the Web in the last decade+, forms have changed little since Mosaic 1.0. We now have JavaScript to give them a little intelligence, and browsers can sometimes autofill a few fields, but otherwise they present the same basic interface they did ten years ago. The wait for better user interfaces is over. XForms are a radically more powerful forms technology for the Web that enables separation of presentation and content, data type aware input fields, enhanced accessibility for users, far richer user interface widgets, and much, much more. Learn how you can take advantage of XForms to build the next generation of killer web apps. </p><h3>Web Forms 2.0</h3><p>Despite all the advances made on the Web in the last decade, forms have changed little since Mozilla 1.0. JavaScript gave them a little intelligence, and browsers can sometimes autofill a few fields, but otherwise forms present the same basic interface they did ten years ago. The wait for better user interfaces is over. Web Forms 2.0 is a more powerful forms technology for the Web that enables separation of presentation and content, data type aware input fields, repeating fields, updateable forms, and more but still works in today's mainstream browsers. Learn how you can take advantage of Web Forms 2.0 to build the next generation of killer web apps. </p><h3><a href="albany/xquery/">XQuery</a> (approximately 1.5 hours)</h3><p> XQuery is a new fourth generation language being designed at the W3C to extract information from collections of XML documents, including those stored in native XML databases. It is based on XPath 2.0, but features a more familiar, procedural syntax than XSLT. This talk explores XQuery 1.0, shows you when it's appropriate and where you can use it. You'll learn both the syntax and semantics of this powerful new language. You'll also get a personal demo of XQuisitor, a new open source GUI tool for querying XML based on the XQuery language and Michael Kay's Saxon 7.0. This talk assumesfamiliarity with basic XML.</p><h3><a href="sd2000west/dtds/">DTDs</a> (approximately 1.5 hours)</h3><p>XML based markup languages are described with Document TypeDefinitions (DTDs). This seminar shows you how to document yourown XML applications using DTDs. You'll learn how to declareelements, attributes, and entities; how to validate documentsagainst DTDs; and how to organize your DTDs in a clear,maintainable, and reusable fashion. This talk assumesfamiliarity with basic XML.</p><h3><a href="sd2003west/schemas/">Schemas</a> (approximately 2 hours)</h3><p>One of the most common complaints about DTDs is that they don't allow authorsto specify constraints on the element and attribute content. For instance,they do not let you say that a <code>MONTH</code> element contains an integerbetween 1 and 12. Schemas fill this gap in the XML family. They also fill many otherholes left by DTDs; among them inheritance, data typing, and namespace-aware validation.This talk introduces you to the W3C's new XML schema language, and shows you how to use itto make validation far more powerful. </p><h3><a href="xmlonelondon2001/xlinks/">XML Hypertext</a> (2 hours)</h3><p>Without links, HTML would have been just another documentformat. Without links it could never have created the World WideWeb. And yet until quite recently XML has been lacking anysimilar facility. The wait, however, is over. This talkintroduces XLinks, XPointers, XInclude, and XML Base, the technologies that enable you to make XML not just text but hypertext. You'll learn how to put these all together to build hypertext systems far moresophisticated than anything that's possible with HTML.</p><h3><a href="xmlonelondon2001/xlinks/">XLinks</a> (1.5 hours)</h3><p>Without links, HTML would have been just another documentformat. Without links it could never have created the World WideWeb. And yet until quite recently XML has been lacking anysimilar facility. The wait, however, is over. This talkintroduces XLinks, the primary means ofmaking XML not just text but hypertext. You'll learn how to use both simple and extendedXLinks to build hypertext systems far moresophisticated than anything that's possible with HTML.</p><h3>XInclude (1 hour)</h3><p>XInclude is a radical new way of building large XML documents outof smaller component parts. Unlike competing technologies such as general entity references and XLinks,all the parts are fully usable by themselves as well as when merged with themaster document. Indeed one part can be used in many different documents. XInclude encourages modular and reusable development of web sites, book,and information systems. </p><p>This talk completely covers XInclude syntax.Several different implementations are presented using a variety of APIs,and the strengths and weaknesses of each are elaborated.</p><h3><a href="xmloneaustin2001/xslt/">XSL Transformations</a> (1.5 hours) </h3><p>The Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) includes a very powerfuldeclarative language for transforming XML documents into new XMLdocuments called XSLT. XSLT has many applications includingelectronic commerce and Web page display. In this talk you'lllearn how to write XSL stylesheets that can change XML to HTML,sort data, extract subsets of the data, and otherwise manipulateand massage data for display to the end user.</p><h3><a href="sd2003west/xslt2/">XSLT 2.0 and Beyond</a> (2 hours) </h3><p>XSLT 1.0 has been one of the biggest success stories in the XML family.It's solved a lot of problems developers didn't even know they haduntil they saw what XSLT could do. This talk explores the future of querying and transforming XML documents including new XSLT elements such as <code>xsl:document</code>, extension functions written in XSLT,a new version of XPath that can query remote documentsand use functions in location paths, and a whole new languagecalled XQuery, a fourth-generation languagefor extracting data from XML documents and using thatdata to produce new XML documents. Attendees should be reasonably comfortable with XSLT 1.0before attempting this class. </p><h3><a href="xmlsig/xquery">XQuery</a> (1.5 hours)</h3><p>XQuery is a new fourth generation language being designed at the W3Cto extract information from collections of XML documents, including those stored in native XML databases. It is based on XPath 2.0, but features a more familiar, procedural syntax than XSLT. This talk explores XQuery 1.0, shows you when it's appropriate and  where you can use it. You'll learn both the syntax and semantics of this powerful new language. You'll also get a personal demo of XQuisitor, a new open source GUI tool for querying XML based on the XQuery language andMichael Kay's Saxon 7.0.</p><h3><a href="sd2000west/sax/">SAX, the Simple API for XML (1.5 hours)</a></h3><p>SAX is a straight-forward, event based Java API for reading XML documents.It's parser independent and supported by all major parsersincluding Xerces, Oracle's XML Parser for Java, and expat.This talk shows you how to use SAX to read XML documentsof any size and any complexity. We'll discuss the data structuresthe event approach necessitates, and see examples of parsing many differentkinds of XML documents. </p><h3>Cookies Are Bad For You</h3><p>Cookies are an ugly hack that violate the fundamental design of HTTP. They attempt to graft sessions onto a stateless, sessionless protocol. Applications that depend on cookies are thus fragile, insecure, and user-hostile.  This talk will explain the problems with cookies, and then demonstrate the proper, RESTful way to build web sites and applications that support user authentication, shopping carts, games, and more without using any cookies anywhere. The resulting applications are far more reliable and user friendly than the cookie-based applications they replace.</p><h3>REST: Web Applications Don't Have to be Tiresome</h3><p>Cookies giving you indigestion? Session state overloading your servers? Web Services breaking down your firewalls? It's not you. The Web was never meant to work like this, and the problems you're having are a direct result of working against the design of HTTP rather than with it.</p><p>HTTP has an explicit architecture, and that architecture is called REST. Stateless web applications built with REST principles are simpler, faster, more robust, more secure, and much more scalable than the client-server architectures frequently deployed. Come learn how to build systems play to HTTP's strengths instead of compensating for its weaknesses.</p><h3><a href="sd2003west/xmlpull/">XMLPULL (1.5 hours)</a></h3><p>XMLPULL is a new, extremely fast streaming API for reading XML documentsthat can handle arbitrarily large documents without many of the complexities of SAX. This pull-based API has the potential to be as easy to use as tree-based APIs like DOM and JDOM while being as fast and memory efficient aspush-based APIs like SAX. Although its API is very different than either SAX or DOM, XMLPULL is fully conformant with all relevant XML standards. It supports well-formedness checking, validation, namespaces, and even schemas. Learn how you can integrate pull-parsing into your application chains. </p><h3><a href="sd2004west/stax/">StAX (1.5 hours)</a></h3><p>StAX, the Streaming API for XML, is a new pull parsing API for processing XML with Java. Unlike traditional, SAX based push parsers, pull parsers put your application in charge of the program. You drive the processing rather than being driven by it. Nonetheless, you get all the speed and size advantages of a streaming API. This class explores the design patterns common in pull parsing. Learn how you can integrate pull-parsing into your application chains, and more importantly whether you should.</p><h3><a href="sd2005west/effectivexml/">Effective XML</a> (1.5 hours)</h3><p>Six years after XML 1.0 was released, the community is finally beginning to understand which practices work and which ones don't. This talk explores patterns (and quite a few anti-patterns) common in XML development, and explains which are which, and why. You'll learn as many specific ways to improve your XML systems as we can cram into 90 minutes. </p><h3><a href="sd2005west/relaxng/">RELAX: Schemas Don't Have to be Hard</a></h3><p>Do DTDs bore you? Does the W3C XML Schema Language drive you to tears? Rejoice, because an alternative is here. RELAX NG is a new international standardschema language that's based on powerful mathematics but simple enough for math-phobics to use. It provides the 80% of features developers actually need from schemas at about 20% of the complexity. And it can do a few things the  W3C XML Schema Language can't. In 90 minutes you can learn to do with RELAX NG what would take a full day of training in the W3C XML Schema Language. </p><h3>What's Wrong with XML APIs and How to Fix Them (1.5 hours)</h3><p>Existing XML APIs range from too complex (DOM, SAX) to too simple (JDOM) or both (ElectricXML, dom4j).Is there a happy medium? Can an API be both easy-to-use  for developers who don't spend their weekends memorizing W3C recommendations while  being correct and powerful enough to satisfy the experts?How simple can an XML API possibly be? How complex does it have to be? We're going to share war stories about XML APIs likeSAX and DOM, and explore some possible solutions for going forward. </p><h3><a href="sd2000west/dom/">DOM for XML and Java (1.5 hours)</a></h3><p>The Document Object Model is a language and parser independentstandard API for reading and writing XML and HTML documents.It presents the document to the programmeras a tree data structure in which theindividual elements, comments, processing instructions, text,and other parts of the document all comprise nodes.This talk teaches you how to use the DOM to read and write XML documentsfrom your Java programs while automatically maintaining well-formednessand checking validity. </p><h3>DOM Level 3</h3><p>DOM Level 3 is the next generation of thepopular Document Object Model language and parser independent API for reading and writing XML and HTML documents. DOM3 adds standard means of locating a parser, creating a new document, and accessing DTDs and schemas. It also fill a number of holes in existing DOM interfaces such as <code>Element</code> and <code>Node</code>.  Attendees should already be familiar with the DOM2 Core API. </p><h3><a href="xmlsig/jdom/">JDOM (2 hours)</a></h3><p>JDOM is an open source, tree-based, Java APIfor processing XML documents that's been designed with simplicity andconvenience as its foremost purposes.JDOM programs can use any commonly available SAX or DOM parser.At a high level, it's similar to the DOM, but since JDOM was designed specificallyfor Java rather than for multiple languages, it feels much more natural and "right"to Java programmers. This talk teaches you how to use the JDOM to read and write XML documentsfrom your Java programs while automatically maintaining well-formednessand checking validity. It also compares and contrasts JDOM with the existing SAX and DOM APIs to help you choose which API to use for which projects. </p><h3><a href="xmldevconlondon2001/namespaces/">XML Namespaces</a> (1.5 hours)</h3><p>Namespaces are one of the most fundamental yet widely misunderstood factorsin the XML equation. They do both more and less than many people expect of them.This talk shows you how to use namespaces in both new and existing XML applications,including how to integrate them with DTDs and schemas.   </p><h2>Advanced Tutorials</h2><p>These are longer half and full-day sessions thatdemand more of the student. In particular, they all assume a solid grasp of XML basicsand extensive competence in Java.</p><h3><a href="sd2003west/handsonxslt/">Hands-On XSLT (3 hours)</a> </h3><p>The Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) includes a very powerfuldeclarative language for transforming XML documents into new XMLdocuments called XSLT. XSLT has many applications includingelectronic commerce and Web page display. In this talk you'll write XSL stylesheets that can change XML to HTML,sort data, extract subsets of the data, and otherwise manipulateand massage data for display to the end user.</p><p>Participants will be expected to bring a laptop with Java 1.3 or later. Java is necessary to run the software we'll be using.However, no knowledge of Java Programming is required. Students should also download SAXON 6.5.2 to their laptop from http://saxon.sourceforge.net/ before class.(If a later version of SAXON 6.x is published between now and the class,you can use that instead. Do not download SAXON 7.x though.

XML is suitable not only for Web pages, but also forapplication file formats, object serialization, and data interchangebetween applications. This tutorial will show you how to use Java toprocess XML documents and show you why you might want to do that.<p>XML files are text files so you'll explore how Java outputs textusing Writers and how to use these classes to write XML. Then you'll seesome demonstrations of the conversion of existing data formats to XML.Of course writing data is only half of the I/O equation so next you'lllearn how to read XML documents from Java. Input is considerably morecomplicated than output. Fortunately 90% of the work can be done for youby free parsers like the Apache Project's Xerces. You'll see how to usethe standard, event based Simple API for XML (SAX) to drive your ownprograms through callbacks.<p>Most parsers also support a more object oriented view of an XML documentby implementing the W3C's Document Object Model (DOM).

However we'll look at it fromthe perspective of a programmer using XML as an output format.XML files are text files so you'll explore how Java outputs textusing Writers and how to use these classes to write XML. Thenyou'll see some demonstrations of the conversion of existingdata formats to XML. </p><p>Of course writing data is only half of theI/O equation so next you'll learn how to read XML documents fromJava.

You'll see how you canuse Java to query databases for XML results; how you can storeXML in relational databases; and how you can move data betweendifferently structured tables in different databases by usingXML, schemas, and validation. Finally, you'll investigate someof the alternative approaches for mixing XML with databasesincluding relational databases, object databases, hierarchicaldatabases, and XML-native databases.�/p� --><p><i>This talk can be combined with the Intro to XML Tutorial to form a 2-dayintroduction to Java for Programmers. </i></p><h4 >Outline:</h4><ul><li>The Fine Points of XML<li>Text I/O in Java<li>Writing XML with Java<li>Reading XML with SAX1<li>Reading XML with SAX2<li>Reading XML with DOM2<li>XML-RPC</ul><h4 >Prerequisites: </h4><p>Students should be completely comfortable  programming in Java, should have at least a user's understanding of the Internet,and should be familiar with XML Basics. </p><h3 ><a href="xmldevcon2000/advancedxml/">Advanced XML Tutorial</a> (1 day)</h3><p>This one day tutorial is not for the faint of heart. We're goingto run right up to the bleeding edge of today's XML technology,and then we're going to keep on going. This tutorial is fordevelopers who have already mastered the basics of XML, DTDs,and namespaces and are looking for the next level.

This tutorialshows you not only where XML is and what you can do with ittoday, but also where it's going and what you'll be able to dowith it tomorrow. If you want to get a leg up on yourcompetitors by understanding tomorrow's technology today, thisis the talk for you.</p><h4 >Prerequisites: </h4><p>Students should be comfortable programming in Java, should have at least a user's understanding of the Internet,and should be familiar with standard XML and Namespaces.  </p><hr><center>[ <a href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/">Cafe con Leche</a> | <a href="../mailinglists.html">Mailing Lists</a> | <a href="../books.html">Books</a> | <a href="../tradeshows.html">Trade Shows</a> ]</center><hr>Copyright 2000-2004 <address><a href="http://www.elharo.com/">Elliotte Rusty Harold</a></address><br /><address><a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;elharo%40metalab%2Eunc%2Eedu">elharo&#64;metalab&#46;unc&#46;edu</a></address><br /> Last Modified January 18, 2006</body></html>
