I've updated <a href="books/bible/updates/15.html">Chapter 15 of the XML Bible,
XSL Formatting Objects</a>, to cover the November 27, 2000
Candidate Recommendation and FOP 0.16. The changes were quite minor overall. 
No elements were added or deleted. A few properties were added and another batch deleted.
The largest change was the renaming of <code>font-height-override-after</code> to <code>text-depth</code>
and <code>font-height-overrride-before</code> to <code>text-altitude</code>.

I've got an urgent need for a Motorola Timeport P7389 cell phone.
This is a tri-band, WAP-enabled, GSM world phone. I need it
to replace the Ericsson I888 VoiceStream mistakenly told me would support WAP. 
However, stores in New York don't seem to carry this model yet; and the only place I've found to buy one
on the Web says I'll have to show the truck driver who delivers it my photo ID.
Since this particular store is located in London, I doubt they'll ship across the Atlantic.
If anybody does know where I can buy this particular model without a bundled service plan, would you please
<a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111&#58;elharo%40metalab%2Eunc%2Eedu?Subject=P7389">drop me a line</a>? Thanks.

Antenna House has updated
their
<a href="http://www.antennahouse.com/">XSL Formatter</a>,
an XSL Formatting Objects to PDF converter for Windows, to version
0.1.0.1227.
This release fixes assorted bugs.
It supports most of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/CR-xsl-20001121/">November 21 XSL-FO
Candidate Recommendation</a>.
   Its most notable feature is the ability to handle Japanese and other Asian

The W3C seems to be in their usual pre-Christmas rush to push new drafts out the door.
They've published 15 separate notes, proposed recommendations, candidate recommendations,
and working drafts since December 4, about half of them in the last week as well as
a new version 4.2.1
of the open source
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Amaya/http://www.w3.org/Amaya/">Amaya</a> web browser for Windows and Unix.
</p>

<p>
Most recently the  XML Core  Working Group has
reverted the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-xml-infoset-20001220">XML InfoSet spec</a> back to
working draft status.
</p>



<p>
Also, several editors of the XLink specification have also published a semi-official note
on "<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/NOTE-xlink-naming-20001220">XLink Markup Name Control</a>".
This proposes a
possible XML Schema-based solution to address the question of how to integrate
XLink syntax like <code>xlink:href</code> into existing non-XLink aware
hypertext vocabularies like XHTML 1.0.
</p>

<p>
I'm leaving for Christmas vacation myself today. I'll have Internet access while I'm away.
Nonetheless things are likely to be a little slow here for the next week,
and you probably have better things to do than think about XML right now yourself.
But I do promise to have some big announcements and a major shift in direction for this site
come the New Year.

The XML Apache Project has
just posted <a href="http://xml.apache.org/dist/xalan-j/">Xalan-Java 2.0.D05</a>.
This is  a beta developer's release. It should fully implement
the XSLT and XPath 1.0 specifications, as well as
the new Java Transformation  API for XML  (TrAX).
The API has been changed to mirror changes in Trax and
the Java API for XML Processing (JAXP). This release also includes "greatly
expanded support for custom stylesheet control  over output properties, and
numerous other upgrades and bug fixes."

The W3C has released <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-xhtml-basic-20001219">XHTML Basic as an official Recommendation</a>
(i.e. a standard to anyone who isn't trying to stay clear of antitrust actions).
 XHTML Basic document type includes the minimal set of modules
 from modular XHTML (not yet a recommendation itself)
  required to be an XHTML host language
          document type
          plus the images, forms, basic tables, object support modules.
           It is designed for Web
          clients that do not support full HTML such as mobile phones, PDAs,
          pagers, and settop boxes.

<p>
The W3C has also published a new working draft
of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-xforms-20001219">XForms 1.0</a>.
XForms are a new kind of  Web forms that "can be used with a wide variety of platforms of

IBM's alphaWorks
has released a new version of
<a href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/DDbE">Data Descriptors by Example (DDbE)</a>
with
"Enhanced support for XML Schemas that follows the XML Schema CR of
12/24/00".
That's very interesting since that date is still a little bit in the future.
Does IBM know something I don't know?  Can we expect an early Christmas present from the W3C?
Or did somebody's fingers slip on a keyboard? They probably meant the 10/24/00 draft from two months
ago. As any reader of Cafe con Leche knows I make mistakes like that all the time.
Still, it wouldn't be the first time IBM let a cat out of the bag
a little earlier than they planned.
</p>

<p> In either case,
DDbE is a Java component library for inferring an XML DTD or Schema from a
  set of well-formed XML instances. DDbE offers parameters which permit the
  user to control the structure of the content models and the types used for
  attribute declarations. The goal of DDbE is to give users a good start at creating
  DTDs for their own applications.
</p>

<p>AlphaWorks has also updated the <a href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/xmlbridge4sap">XML Bridge for SAP</a>.
This product provides XML integration between SAP
  R/3 systems on the one side and arbitrary SAP R/3 or
  non-SAP systems on the other side.
This runs inside WebSphere AE 3.5. This release adds support AIX and Linux
 as well as load-balanced SAP R/3 systems for
inbound calls.

Lots of Unicode news today. First off, the Unicode Consortium has published the
first beta data files for
<a href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/3.1-Update/">Unicode 3.1</a>.
Version 3.1 adds many new characters and new blocks
including:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Old Italic</li>
    <li>Gothic</li>
    <li>Deseret</li>
    <li>Byzantine Musical Symbols</li>
    <li>Musical Symbols</li>
    <li>Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols</li>
    <li>CJK Unified Ideographs Extension B</li>
    <li>CJK Compatibility Ideographs Supplement</li>
    <li>Tags</li>
</ul>

<p>
Most importantly, even for developers who don't have a specific need for any of these characters,
all of these have code points greater than 65535 (0xFFFF).
Characters beyond the Basic Multilingual Plane are no longer just a
theoretical possibility. And production 2 of the XML 1.0 specification does
allow these characters to appear in XML documents, though it specifically forbids their representation
as surrogate pairs. Surrogate pairs could probably still be used in the actual documents provided
the parsers resolve them into the actual characters they represent before interpreting them as XML.
That is, a document that used surrogate pairs would just be another encoding
that the parser would convert to full Unicode.
</p>
<p>
Nonetheless, this is going to break a lot of poorly written software that assumed
a single Unicode character could be represented in only two bytes.
I can't speak for other programming languages, but Java is going to have big trouble with this.
</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>
The W3C and the Unicode Consortium have published a joint technical report/note
on <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/unicode-xml/">Unicode in XML and other Markup Languages</a>
which addresses many conflicts between XML markup and
Unicode characters. However, it seems to be silent on the practical
issue of how to handle
supplemental characters that occupy
more than two bytes with existing software and tools.
</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>
Finally,  IBM has released version 1.7 of their
<a href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/download/1.7/">International Components
 for Unicode (ICU 1.7)</a>, an open source, locale sensitive
  C and C++ class library for Unicode savvy text formatting
  including:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Calendar support</li>
    <li> Character set conversions</li>
    <li>Language-sensitive collation ()</li>
    <li> Date and time formatting</li>
    <li> Message catalogs  </li>
    <li>Message formatting </li>
    <li>Normalization </li>
    <li> Number and currency formatting</li>
    <li>Time zones</li>
    <li>Transliteration</li>
    <li>Word, line and sentence breaking</li>
</ul>

 <p>
Changes in version 1.7 include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Improved collation performance</li>
    <li>Conversion support: for
    ISO-2022-JP/CN/KR with extensions,
    GB 18030, and HZ</li>
    <li>Partial UTF-32 support</li>
    <li>Code/data library names contain version numbers</li>
    <li>Debian packaging</li>
    <li>Improved API documentation</li>

The W3C XML Signature Working Group
has posted a new <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/CR-xml-c14n-20001212">Candidate Recommendation
of the Canonical XML specification</a>.
Canonical XML is a series of rules for converting XML documents into a
sequence of bytes such that twoo documents with the same canonical form are in some sense the same.
This version just cleans up a few editorial issues.
</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>
The W3C has published the first working draft of
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-xslt11-20001212/">XSLT <strong>1.1</strong></a>.
Some of the most important changes and new features include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The value of <code>xsl:stylesheet</code>'s version attribvute is now <code>1.1</code>,
    at least for stylesheets that take adavantage of the new elements and attributes in XSLT 1.1.
    The value <code>1.0</code> is still allowed.</p></li>
     <li><p>There's a standard <code>xsl:document</code> element for producing multiple output documents from a single 
     input document and style sheet. The syntax is almost identical to the existing <code>xsl:output</code> element
     with the addittion of an <code>href</code> attribute to specify where the output document will be stored. 
     The functionality is roughly equivalent to the <code>xt:document</code> and <code>saxon:document</code> extension functions in XT and SAXON
   respectively, and much simpler than the Redirect extension function in Xalan.  
     </p></li>
     <li><p> <code>xsl:apply-imports</code> element can have <code>xsl:with-param</code> children to pass parameters
     to the applied imported templates, so it's now
     on a par with <code>xsl:apply-templates</code> parameters. In other words, <code>xsl:apply-imports</code> is now exactly like
     <code>xsl:apply-templates</code> except that it only applies templates in imported style sheets. 
     </p></li>
<li><p>A new <code>xsl:script</code> element lets you define extension functions inside the stylesheet.
</p></li>	<li><p>The result tree fragment data-type has been eliminated. Variable-binding elements with content now
      construct node-sets</p></li>
      <li><p> XML Base is supported</p></li>
<li><p>Extension functions are allowed to return "external" objects, which do not have any of the builtin XPath
      types.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
There are also a lot of clarifications, additional examples, and bug fixes.
On the other hand, I note that my personal pet peeve in section 13 has not been fixed. This states,
"The <code>xsl:message</code> is instantiated by instantiating the content to create an XML
fragment. This XML fragment is the content of the message." The problem is the phrase "XML fragment"
is nowhere defined, although an added example seems to suggest
that  what's meant is a string containing XML markup and text, though perhaps not a complete XML docuemnt. 
So far I don't see anything in here that is likely to break existing style sheets.

The Apache XML Project has posted the first alpha release of
<a href="http://xml.apache.org/dist/xerces-j/">Xerces-J 2.0.0</a>, an XML parser written in Java.
The 2.0 branch is a major rearchitecting
of the internal structure of the parser. 
However, the functionality is much the same as in the current 1.2 branch; that is,
XML 1.0, DTDs namespaces, SAX, SAX2, DOM1 and DOM2.
Schemas are not yet supported in this branch.
According to the announcement,
"Since it is an alpha release, defects are expected in the source code, documentation and packaging."
I'd say that at this point you should stick to Xerces-J 1.2.x unless you're planning on hacking on the code.

The Apache XML Project has released the first beta
of <a href="http://xml.apache.org/batik/index.html">Batik</a>, a Java program/class library
for browsing Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) documents and converting them to
GIF or PNG. This is based on the Java 2D API, and supports most of the 
static features of the  November 2nd, 2000 Candidate Recommendation of SVG.
Animation and other dynamic features are planned. 
</p>

<p>
The current beta 1 release is definitely a little rough, and I recommend it for extreme early adopters only
at this point. Clearly a lot of thought has gone into the initial documentation, and there were copious step-by-step
instructions for installing this and getting it to run, including such often omitted details as
setting particular environment variables and setting up your CLASSPATH.
Unfortunately that's no substitute for a more intuitive. less complicated process.
I had a great deal of trouble getting it to display the 
sample documents, problems which I eventually tracked down to
an old version of w3c.jar in my ext directory. Less motivated/experienced users would never have gotten past
this. Clearly the problem isn't with Batik itself, which is a very nice piece of work. 
It's with Java's insanely complex, difficult and unintuitive installation system. 
Here are three changes I propose to make Java software much more competitive with compiled software:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>Break the connection between package structure and directories. 
	This single problem causes more difficulty for new users of Java than almost
	everything else combined. Both .class and .java files contain sufficient internal
	information for
	the compiler to tell what package the class is in. Why does this need to be duplicated in the 
	file system?
	</p></li>
	<li><p>Add enforceable version info to the manifest in a JAR archive. Allow 
	other programs to simply and easily specify which version of a standard JAR archive like w3c.jar 
	they must load. Allow multiple versions to coexist in the CLASSPATH.
	</p></li>
	<li><p>Make JAR archives truly runnable. That is, let me download 
	a JAR archive, double-click it, and have the program embedded in that archive run like any other
	standalone application. Microsoft's VM does let developers build standalone executable for Windows,
	and these are so much easier
	to install and use that I invariably pick them when given a choice between standalone versions and pure Java versions.
	This should be available on all platforms in all VMs. Indeed it should be the standard way to distribute a Java program to end users

The Apache XML Project has released version 1.2.3 of their
<a href="http://xml.apache.org/dist/xerces-j/">Xerces XML parser for Java</a>.
This is mostly

It also adds a new 
load-external-dtd SAX feature so that applications 
that don't require validation can also 
ask the parser not to load the external DTD 
subset.

documents. Kay still recommmends version 5.5.1 for production use at this time until 6.0.1
has been tested further and more bugs have been shaken out. The 6.x series also add two new extension attributes 
(Is that legal?) to <code>xsl:output</code>:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>When the output method is html, 
<code>saxon:omit-meta-declaration</code> determines  whether or not
a <code>META</code> element is automatically added to the <code>HEAD</code> element.</p></li>

<li><p>The <code>saxon:character-representation</code> attribute 
specifies whether characters like &amp; and &lt;, as well as 
characters not available in the chosen encoding,
that appear in parsed character data and attribute values
should be output with decimal or hexadecimal character references.
In HTML output, the predefined Latin-1 entity references can also be used.

The W3C has promoted <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/CR-xsl-20001121/">XSL Formatting Objects</a> 
to a candidate recommendation.
I'll try to read and comment on this sometime next week,
after I return from my annual Thanksgiving trip to
the family farm in Kentucky.
The Working Group has proposed the following criteria
for moving to Proposed Recommendation:
</p>

<ul><li>Sufficient reports of implementation experience have 
	   been gathered to demonstrate that XSL processors based 
	   on the specification are implementable and have compatible 
	   behavior.</li>

	<li>An implementation report shows that there is at least one
	   implementation for each basic formatting object and 
	   property.</li>

	<li> Providing Formal responses to all comments received.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>As usual, I think these requirements are not strong enough. I'd
	like to propose my own requirements:</p>

<ul><li>There are at least <strong>two</strong> independent,
<strong>complete</strong> implementations of the <strong>entire</strong> specification. </li>

	<li>At least one of the implementations generates printed pages.</li>

	<li>At least one of the implementations generates an onscreen display.</li>

I've returned from San Jose and XML DevCon 2000. It was a fun conference. I wish I had 
had more time to spend there. I've posted the notes from the talk I gave Sunday
on <a href="slides/xmldevcon2000/advancedxml/">The Bleeding Edge of XML</a>. I'll have more news from the show soon.
</p>

<p>
One down note from the show: after years of being a loyal Dell customer,
I probably won't be buying from them again. As sometimes happens, in the rush to get out
on Thursday
I neglected to pack the power adapter for my Dell Latitude LS notebook. 
Apparently Dell uses numerous non-standard parts on this model, and 
consequently in the heart of Silicon Valley I was unable to locate a replacement power adapter, battery charger,
or anything else that would let me run the laptop once its battery ran down on the flight over. Not to worry. 
I had showed up a few days early
so  I called Dell and, after waiting on hold for almost an hour,
ordered a replacement power adapter to be delivered to my hotel on Saturday, the day
before I was scheduled to present.
Dell wanted $50 extra for overnight delivery, but since it was my fault for leaving the 
adapter home in the first place I didn't really object.
Then Dell promptly lost my order. When I called them Saturday to find out where my adapter was they had no record of my order,
even though I'd been given an order confirmation number, told the 
adapter was in stock, and promised it would definitely be there on Saturday. 
Nonetheless, although they claimed to have no record of my order, they
managed to charge my credit card $98.90 just the same. (Needless to say, I'll be disputing this charge.)
</p>

<p>
I depend on Dell hardware to get my job done. I need to know that when that my computer goes down, whether 
through hardware failure or just because of my own forgetfulness, I can get replacement parts quickly and with no hassle.  
Dell failed this test miserably. Replacement parts were completely unavailable in the the most wired 
city on the planet, though local store shelves were full of batteries and adapters for IBM, Toshiba, and Compaq. 
When I tried to get Dell to fix the problem, they charged my credit card but did not do what
they promised to do. Fortunately fellow-presenter Mark Volkmannn was kind enough to loan me his laptop Sunday, so I could
deliver the scheduled talk. Nonetheless, he shouldn't have had to. In the future when I'm looking for new hardware, 
I won't be looking to
Dell.

<p>
<a href="http://info.netscape.com/fwd/hop11n2.2/http://home.netscape.com/browsers/6/index.html">Netscape 6.0</a> has been released, for
<a href="ftp://ftp.netscape.com/pub/netscape6/english/6.0/unix/linux22/">Linux</a>,
<a href="ftp://ftp.netscape.com/pub/netscape6/english/6.0/windows/win32/">Windows 95 and later</a>, 
 and <a href="ftp://ftp.netscape.com/pub/netscape6/english/6.0/mac/macos8.5/">MacOS 8.5 and later</a>,
though the FTP servers seem to be more than a little overloaded
right now.
This is the first release version of Netscape based on the Mozilla source code.
Among other features, it supports direct display of XML documents with attached CSS style sheets.

</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>
The W3C has released version 4.0 of 
 <a href="http://www.w3.org/Amaya/">Amaya</a>, their experimental web browser 
 and editor for Windows and Unix. 
 Amaya is open source and source code is available.
 Version 4.0 still doesn't support direct display of XML documents in the browser, but
 it does support:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>HTML 4.0</li>
	<li>XHTML 1.0</li>
	<li>HTTP 1.1</li>
	<li>MathML 2.0</li>
	<li>Parts of CSS 2 </li>
	<li>Parts of SVG </li>
</ul>

<hr></hr>
<p>
The W3C has promoted DOM Level 2 to official recommendation.
This is divided into five specifications:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Core/">Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2 Core Specification</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Views/">Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2 Views Specification</a> </li>
	<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Events/">Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2 Events Specification</a> </li>
	<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Style/">Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2 Style Specification</a> </li>
	<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Traversal-Range/">Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2 Traversal and Range Specification</a> </li>
</ul>
<hr></hr>

<p>
The W3C has promoted <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/CR-MathML2-20001113/">MathML 2.0</a> to Candidate Recommendation.
The major change is a specification for a MathML DOM. There are a number of minor and editoial changes as well. 
The Candidate Recommendation review period
ends on  December 14. Once again I consider this to be far too short given the 
limited implementation experience with MathML that's already available.

<p>
The <a href="slides/sd2000east/schemas/">Schemas</a> and <a href="slides/sd2000east/advancedxml/">Advanced XML</a> 
in particular contain information that's not easily available elsewhere,
and hasn't been covered in any books yet. I'll be reprising Advanced XML this
Sunday under the title <cite>The Bleeding Edge of XML</cite> at
XML DevCon San Jose. Updates may be a little slow here until I return.

David Flanagan's posted a
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/news/flanagan_1100.html">call for Netscape to refrain from shipping Netscape 6.0 unitl
they're actually standards compliant</a>. Most of the bugs he complains about
strike me as fairly minor and relatively obscure, 
and shouldn't affect any web site that uses solid design principles. 
However one in particular is pretty nasty. To be specific, 
"The DOM methods removeChild() and replaceChild() can
                            crash the browser. There is a patch available for this bug, but it
                            will not be applied for Navigator 6.0."
The effect of this bug is that a web page can easily choose to crash Netscape 6 (and possibly the OS
on memory-protected systems) by executing a simple piece of JavaScript when the page loads. 
This is not acceptable and should be considered a show-stopper. 
Applications should never crash for any reason. When a crashing bug is discovered, no matter how obscure,
it must be  fixed.

The W3C released several new drafts of various XML applications while I was away in D.C. last week.
First, the Mobile Subgroup of the W3C HTML Working
Group has elevated <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/PR-xhtml-basic-20001103">XHTML Basic</a> to
Proposed Recommendation status. From the abstract:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The XHTML Basic document type includes the minimal set of modules required to be an XHTML Host Language document type, and in addition it
includes images, forms, basic tables, and object support. It is designed for Web clients that do not support the full set of XHTML features; for example,
Web clients such as mobile phones, PDAs, pagers, and settop boxes. The document type is rich enough for content authoring.
</p>

<p>
XHTML Basic is designed as a common base that may be extended. For example, an event module that is more generic than the traditional HTML 4
event system could be added or it could be extended by additional modules from XHTML Modularization such as the Script Module. The point is that
XHTML Basic always is the common language that user agents support.
</p>

<p>
The document type definition is implemented using XHTML modules as defined in "Modularization of XHTML".
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Furthermore, the W3C 
 SVG Working Group has promoted <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/CR-SVG-20001102/index.html">Scalable Vector Graphics</a> 
to Candidate Recommendation. This is a minor update to the spec that mostly makes editorial fixes as well as clarifying a few
points about the SVG DOM.
The most visible change is that the suggested MIME media type is now
"image/svg<strong>+</strong>xml" instead of rom "image/svg<strong>-</strong>xml". 
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, the IETF/W3C XML Signature Working Group has released a Candidate 
Recommendation of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/CR-xmldsig-core-20001031/">XML-Signature Syntax and Processing</a>. The CR phase
 ends January 31, 2001.
</p>

<p>
Finally, the W3C has posted the first public working draft of
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-DOM-Level-3-Content-Models-and-Load-Save-20001101">Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 
Content Models and Load and Save Specification</a> Version 1.0.
This specification plans to define a means for programs to parse and serialize XML documents
without relying on parser-dependent classes. This effectively chops the legs out from under Sun's
JAXP (the Java API for XML Parsing),
since this functionalioty is all that JAXP provides that DOM2 and SAX2 don't.
This spec also defines a preliminary API for accessing the grammar (DTD or schema-based) for an XML document,
something that's been more or less ignored until now. 
</p>

<p>
Dieter Kohler has released the
<a href="http://www.philo.de/xml/dom/">Extended Document Object Model v.2.2.12</a>
for Delphi. This library implements "DOM Core Level 2" and "Level 2 Document Traversal" as well as a 
                           self-developed DTD model.
                            
</p>

<p>
Microsoft's released the final version of
its <a href=http://msdn.microsoft.com/xml/general/xmlparser.asp>MSXML 3</a> XML parser and XSLT processor
for IE5.0 and later on Windows.
This is supposed to be fully compliant with XML/XSLT/XPath 1.0 recommendations.
However a couple of bugs have already surfaced. 
No word yet on when this might be bundled with a release version
of Internet Explorer. 
</p>
<hr>
<p>
Howard Katz 
has posted version 0.89 of his  <a href="http://www.fatdog.com/#DOWNLOAD">XML Query Engine</a>. This is a major update that
fixes a number of outstanding bugs and adds several new features and
optimizations including:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>  Logical subquery operators 'and' and 'or'</li>
	<li>  Set operators 'union' and 'intersect'</li>
	<li>  Namespace support</li>
	<li>  A <code>setDoFullText()</code> method for turning off element text indexing</li>
	<li>  A <code>showDocTree()</code> API for quick visualization of element hierarchy</li>
	<li>  Simple compound-word matching in element content</li>
	<li>  Attribute content moved into index for improved speed and precision</li>
	<li>  A number of other optimizations to improve performance and reduce memory footprint during full-text queries</li>
</ul>

I'm back from SDExpo. The broadcast of the various sessions fell through at the last minute.
Sorry. However, I did do an interview with Dr. Dobbs TechNetCast that will be broadcast

<p>
When I returned from D.C. yesterday one thing I found in my mail box was the German 
translation of <cite>The XML Bible</cite>. This is the most up-to-date version yet,
with coverage of the finished versions of XSLT and XPath 1.0, and much more up-to-date
coverage of XLink and XPointer than in the English edition.
If you read German I recommend checking it out. <cite>Die XML Bibel</cite> costs 89 deutschmarks
(49.50 Euros).
The ISBN number is 3-8266-0627-2 and is published by <a href="http://www.mitp.de/">mitp</a>. 
It's available from <a href="http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/3826606272">amazon.de</a> and other 
retailers of German books. 
</p>

<p>
In related news, Amazon has opened a store in <a
href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/">Japan</a>. The Japanese translation of
the XML Bible isn't finished yet, but when it is done, it should be the
most current version to-date. They do have the Japanese translations of
<a
href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/ASIN/4274062716/">JavaBeans</a>
and what I suspect is of <a
href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/ASIN/4900900567/"><cite>Java
Network Programming</cite></a>, though having even less familiarity with
Japanese than with German I'm not 100% sure of this.

The W3C has posted a new working draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-xinclude-20001026">XInclude</a>.
The big change in this draft is that it's no longer possible to make any element an XInclude element.
Instead, only elements with the name <code>include</code> in the http://www.w3.org/1999/XML/xinclude
namespace are replaced. Furthermore the attributes are no longer prefixed. 
Personally, I don't see what's gained by this. I preferred the attribute-only syntax. 
A typical XInclude element now looks like this:
</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;chapter>
      &lt;xinclude:include xmlns:xinclude="http://www.w3.org/1999/XML/xinclude"
         href="variables.xml" />

Bare Bones Software has released version 6.0.1 of <a href="http://www.barebones.com/support/update.html">BBEdit</a>, the primary

The W3C XML Schema working group has released a Candidate Recommendation of XML Schema.
As usual, there are three parts:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-0/">XML Schema Part 0: Primer</a> </li>
	<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-1/">XML Schema Part 1: Structures</a>  </li>
	<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/">XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>
Most of the changes in these drafts appear to be editorial rather than
substantive. The Candidate Recommendation phase is scheduled to end December 15, 2000. 
Given the complexity of the spec, this is not nearly enough time to gather any real implementation experience,
thus leading once again to the conclusion that the W3C simply doesn't want to 
hear any outside opinions about this. The CR phase may be extended if necessary, but I think a month-and-a-half is so ridiculously little time 
for real experience that extension is almost inevitable. I just wish the W3C would admit that and post a real time frame.
A month and a half is just going to discourage potential implementors.

In related news, Henry S. Thompson has released a stand-alone version

I've updated <a href="books/bible/updates/15.html">Chapter 15 of the XML Bible, XSL Formatting Objects</a>,
to cover the October 18 Working Draft of the XSL specification. The changes were mostly fairly minor. In no particular
order:
</p>

<p>
The <code>fo:simple-link</code> element was renamed <code>fo:basic-link</code>, probably to avoid confusion with
XLink simple links. Along the way it picked up three new properties used to
control the appearance and behavior of the targeted document:
</p>

<dl>
	<dt><code>target-presentation-context</code></dt>
		<dd>A URI that generally indicates some subset of the external 
destination that should actually be presented to the user. For instance, an 
XPointer could be used here to say that although an entire book is loaded 
only the seventh chapter would be shown.</dd>
	<dt><code>target-processing-context</code></dt>
		<dd>A URI that serves as a 
base URI in the event that the external destination contains a relative URI. 
Otherwise, that would be considered relative to the current document. (I'm not a 100%
confident that I've interpreted this one correctly, but this seems the most natural
interpretation.)</dd>
	<dt><code>target-stylesheet</code></dt>
		<dd>A URI that points to a 
style sheet that should be used when the targeted document is rendered. This 
will override any style sheet that the targeted document itself specifies, 
whether through an <code>xml-stylesheet</code> processing instruction, a <code>LINK</code> element in 
HTML, or an HTTP header.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
<code>border-after-precedence</code>, <code>border-before-precedence</code>, <code>border-start-precedence</code>,
and <code>border-end-precedence</code> attributes were added to the table properties to specify what happens when,
for example, one cell's bottom border conflicts with the next cell's top border. 
</p>

<p>
Finally, a <code>font-selection-strategy</code> property was added to the font properties. 
This property lets you specify whether surrounding characters are considered when a font is chosen
that best matches the actual characters.
This is a fairly obscure property that only really 
matters if you're using multiple scripts (e.g. English and Cyrillic) in the same document.
</p>


<p>
Also, Sebastian Rahtz noticed that 
<code>scale-to-fit</code> is now a legal value for <code>content-width</code> and <code>content-height</code>
so that you can make pictures fit exactly on the page. 
</p>

<p>
In related news, RenderX has updated their <a href="http://www.renderx.com/Tests/validator/fo2000.dtd.html">DTD for 
XSL-FO</a> to reflect the latest working draft.

The W3C HTML Working Groups has released the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/CR-xhtml-modularization-20001020">Candidate Recommendation of 
Modularization of XHTML</a>. Comments are due by 
November 17, 2000 which is ludicrously soon. Clearly the W3C isn't truly interested in real
implementation experience with this. 
You can't even use the DTDs they've provided here  without several
other pieces that haven't been released in compatible form yet, 
including Ruby and XHTML Basic. 
The schema implementations are still just palce holders. There's simply way-too much missing for this to
make even a good last call working draft, much less a candidate recommendation.

The XML Apache Project has released the first development version of
<a href="http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/">Xalan 2.0</a>. For now this is primarily of interest to those using Xalan 
as a component of their own programs through its API. 
In particular  it uses SAX2 and DOM2, and it implements a preliminary version of the TraX
(Transformations for XML) interfaces.
It doesn't offer a lot
new if you're merely using it to feed in an XML file and get a transformed document 
using the command line interface or a servlet.

The W3C Working Group has posted a new
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-P3P-20001018/">Last Call Working Draft of the Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) 1.0 
Specification</a>.
P3P enables Web sites to express their privacy practices in a standard XML
format that can be
retrieved automatically and interpreted easily by browsers. Thus users can 
be informed of site practices (in both machine-
and human-readable formats) 
so they don't have to read the
privacy policies of every site they visit. Comments are due bu October 31.

The W3C XSL Working Group has released a new <a href=http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-xsl-20001018/>working draft of
XSL Formatting Objects</a>.

</p>

<p>
The W3C has published <a href="http://www.w3.org/1999/11/REC-xpath-19991116-errata/">errata for the XPath 1.0 specification</a>.
There's nothing too earth-shattering here.
Mostly the exact behavior of some mathematical operators and functions
like <code>*</code>, <code>div</code>, and <code>floor()</code> is more closely specified.
A couple of incorrect examples are fixed too.
The one thing I think will require processor vendors to rev their software is that white space is now 
allowed within expressions. For instance, whereas previously you had to write
<code>/children::person/children::name/children::first/attribute::id</code> you can now add
write <code>/ children :: person / children :: name / children :: first / attribute :: id</code>.
This is mostly useful to we writers who have to try to find ways to fit long XPaths on a single lines.
Not all XSLT processors accept the form with the extra white space now.

IBM's alphaWorks has released 
version 3.3.0 of their
<a href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/xml4c">XML Parser for C++</a>.
 New
features include experimental versions of DOM Level 2 - Range, Traversal
and SAX2, improved support for Entities in the DOM, bug fixes and
performance improvemenents.
This is based on Xerces-C 1.3.0, which is in turn based on IBM's earlier work on XML4C.
</p>

<p>
AlphaWorks has also released a new version of the <a href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/xle">XML Lightweight
Extractor (XLE)</a>.
XLE allows a user to associate the various components 
of a DTD with underlying data sources, then
  extract data from the data sources and assembles it into XML documents conforming to
  that DTD. 
This release adds methods for controlling out of memory problems.

Version 2.2.5 of <a href="http://xmlsoft.org/">libxml</a>, the
 Gnome XML library written in ANSI standard C, has been posted.
 This release adds XPointer support.
Other features inlcude:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Libxml exports Push and Pull type parser interfaces for both XML and HTML.</li> 
 <li>Libxml can do DTD validation at parse time, using a parsed document
   instance, or with an arbitrary DTD. 
</li> 
 <li>Libxml now includes a nearly complete XPath and XPointer implementations. 
</li> 
 <li>It is written in plain C, making as few assumptions as possible, and
   sticking closely to ANSI C/POSIX for easy embedding. Works on
   Linux/Unix/Windows
</li> 
 <li>Basic support for HTTP and FTP client allowing to fetch remote resources 
</li> 
 <li>The design is modular, most of the extensions can be compiled out. 
</li> 
 <li> The internal document representation is as close as possible to the DOM
   interfaces. 
</li> 
 <li>Libxml also has a SAX like interface; the interface is designed to be
   compatible with Expat. 
</li> 
 <li>This library is released both under the W3C IPR and the GNU LGPL.</li>
</ul>

I've posted an updated version of <a href="books/bible/updates/16.html">XLinks</a>, 
Chapter 16 of the XML Bible.
This brings the chapter completely up-to-date with the July 3, 2000 Candidate Recommendation of XLink.
The major changes in this draft were:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Requiring <code>xlink:role</code> and <code>xlink:arcrole</code> attributes to contain a URI</li>
	<li>Using <code>xlink:label</code> attributes to draw arcs between resources in an extended link instead of
	   <code>xlink:role</code> attributes</li>
</ul>


<p>
This is also more or less what's going to be in the second edition of
the <cite>XML Bible</cite> next year, so I'd greatly appreciate it if you let me know
of any errors or mistakes you might notice when reading it. Anything I
get in the next month or so I should be able to correct before
publication. Thanks!

The W3C has released the first public  working draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-css-mobile-20001013">CSS Mobile Profile 1.0</a>. 
This document specifies a profile of the Cascading Style Sheets, level 2 (CSS2) specification appropriate for mobile

<p>
This comes at an opportune time. I'm
just starting on the WML chapter for the second edition of the <cite>XML
Bible</cite>. Yesterday I ordered an Ericsson cell phone from
VoiceStream, and it should be here in a few days. 
I had earlier ordered from Sprint, but they decided I wasn't a good credit risk,
apparently because my driver's license still has my old address.
</p>

<p>
My travails in getting a cell phone, as well as the absolutely ridiculous
agreements all the cell phone companies tried to foist on me, convinced me 
that the cell phone industry is begging for regulation. Buying a cell phone should be as 
straight-forward as getting a land-line, in fact considerably easier because 
no service call is required. My travails over the last month in trying to sign up
for cellular service proved that it is anything but. 
</p>


<p>
One of the things that bothered me about almost all the cell phone agreements was a clause 
saying that the company, not me, owns my phone number. That's a little like an ISP or Network Solutions 
claiming they own your domain name. I see no reason why you shouldn't be allowed to keep your
phone number if you switch companies, states, or phones. But then I realized that I can't keep my land line number
if I move. And then I thought, why not? Area codes and exchanges and even phone numbers themselves 
are relics of outdated technology that we simply accept because we grew up with it.
But if we were starting over today no one would design so openly user-hostile a system.
I mean, how many phone numbers can you actually remember? I don't think I've even got ten phone numbers memorized.
I know far more email addresses and URLs. Why can't you call me by dialing elharo@metalab.unc.edu? 
I suspect eventually this will happen when we stop thinking of phone lines as separate devices from
our data lines, and IP telephony becomes real. But in the meantime, why can't a phone company run a server that maps email addresses,
domain names, and URLs to phone numbers? The actual numbers could vanish into the background and become  
as irrelevant as IP addresses are today. Business plan anyone?

I love days when the Cafe au Lait and Cafe con Leche news are essentially the same.
It makes my job a lot easier. First off, 
Sun's posted the first early access release of the <a href="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/earlyAccess/xml/">Java API for XML Parsing (JAXP) 1.1</a>
on the Java Developer Connection (Registration required).
Mostly this updates JAXP to support SAX2 and DOM2.

<hr></hr>
<p>
Next <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/seamonkey/release-notes/">Mozilla Milestone 18</a> has been released for Windows, MacOS, Linux, and VMS. (That's a new one!)
 The big new feature in this release is Java support for Linux.
 Many bugs are cleaned up as well and probabaly a few new ones introduced. 
 XML support is on a par with the last several releases; that is, no major new support like XSLT or XLinks. 
 However there's now an optional extra package you can install with XSLT, SVG and MathML support.
 Initial reports are that MathML works, SVG doesn't, and XSLT works but only on odd-numbered days.
 This stuff still seems to be pretty crash-prone and bleeding edge, which
 is probabaly why it wasn't included in the default install.

I will once again be chairing the XML Track for the SD2001 West Conference in San Jose,
next April 8-12. That's the week before Easter. 
We're looking for solid technical presentations on XML in 
both 90-minute and full-day formats (though if you haven't presented before, it's probably best to start with
a couple of 90-minute seminars rather than proposing a full-day tutorial.) 
What we really want is in-depth, tutorial material; for example, how to use JDOM, 
how to use WML; how to use schemas, etc. This is a developer conference, and we find that
our audience is
fairly bored with managerial presentations like "How to manage your web site by
integrating XML with E-Commerce" or political presentations like 
"Why RELAX is better than W3C schemas". We're looking for as much information about how to
use the technology as you can cram into 90 minutes. 
For more details or to submit a proposal please go to
the <a href="http://www.sdexpo.com/2001/west/speakers/2001w_infomain.htm">SDExpo speaker web site</a>. 
The deadline is officially tomorrow, Friday the 13th but we'll probably let that slide a bit for
interesting proposals.

I've posted the preliminary version of 
<code><a href="XInclude/">com.macfaq.xml.XIncluder</a></code>,
an XInclude processor I've been working on.
This is written in Java and uses JDOM. This is still very rough but may be of interest
to anyone working with or thinking about XInclude. And if anybody knows of an open source
XPath or XPointer implementation in Java, please <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111&#58;elharo%40metalab%2Eunc%2Eedu?Subject=XPath%20open%20source">drop me a line</a> 
so I can merge that in with this.
I know there are such things in various XSLT programs like SAXON and Xalan. The question is just 
how easy is it to pull out the XPath parts without pulling in all the XSLT parts.

I've now had a chance to read over the
 first <a href="http://java.sun.com/aboutJava/communityprocess/review/jsr063/index.html">public review draft specification
for JAXP 1.1</a>, the Java API for XML parsing. 
Mostly it just incorporates other specs like SAX2, DOM2, and XML 1.0.
However, it incorporates obsolete versions of all of these.
The one thing it adds to the existing specs is a pluggability layer for finding and configuring a parser. 
However, this functionality is already available through <code>XMLReaderFactory</code> in SAX,
and will be added in DOM3 soon.  I don't see any reason to add a separate way of doing this through JAXP.
If you want to read the spec yourself, it's available as a PDF
file only. Comments are due by November 6.

The W3C has published two notes about the use of RDF, the Resource Description Framework:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/NOTE-xlink2rdf-20000929/">Harvesting RDF Statements from XLinks</a>.
	According to the abstract, both XLink  and RDF
	
<blockquote>
	<p>provide a way
            of asserting relations between resources. RDF is primarily for describing
            resources and their relations, while XLink is primarily for specifying and
            traversing hyperlinks. However, the overlap between the two is sufficient
            that a mapping from XLink links to statements in an RDF model can be defined.
            Such a mapping allows XLink elements to be harvested as a source of RDF statements.
            XLink links (hereafter, "links") thus provide an alternate syntax
            for RDF information that may be useful in some situations.
         </p>
         
         <p>This Note specifies such a mapping, so that links can be harvested and
            RDF statements generated. The purpose of this harvesting is to create RDF
            models that, in some sense, represent the <em>intent</em> of the XML
            document.
            The purpose is <em>not</em> to represent the XLink structure in enough
            detail that a set of links could be round-tripped through an RDF model.
         </p>
</blockquote>

	</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/NOTE-photo-rdf-20000928">Describing and retrieving photos using RDF and HTTP</a>. From the abstract:
	
	<blockquote>
<p>
This note describes a project for describing &amp; retrieving (digitized) photos with (RDF) metadata. It describes the
RDF schemas, a data-entry program for quickly entering metadata for large numbers of photos, a way to serve
the photos and the metadata over HTTP, and some suggestions for search methods to retrieve photos based on
their descriptions.
</p>

<p>
The data-entry program has been implemented in Java, a specific Jigsaw frame has been done to retrieve the RDF
from the image through HTTP. The RDF schema uses the Dublin Core schema as well as additional schemas for
technical data.
</p>

<p>
We already have a demo site, and, in a few weeks, we have sample source code available for download.
</p>

<p>
The system can be useful for collections of holiday snapshots as well as for more ambitious photo collections.

The major new feature is the ability to parse 
external DTDs and parameter entities. 
The license has been cahnges to the less restrictive MIT
license rather than the MPL.

<p>
Clark has also handed over future development and
maintenance of expat to a team led by Clark Cooper, hosted on

The W3C has published the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-xml-20001006">second edition of the XML 1.0 specification</a>.
They've gone straight to recommendation status with this, completely skipping the
Proposed and Candidate Recommendation stages. The changes from XML 1.0 
are mostly editorial, with some merging of errata.
The clarification do affect a few parsers that were checking things they should have been,
but mostly this is backward compatible. All documents that were well-formed and valid before are 
still well-formed and valid now. However, a few documents that were not previously well-formed
or valid, at least according to some parsers, are now well-formed and/or valid.

Opera Software has released the first beta (after several preview releases)
of 
<a href="http://www.opera.com/linux/">Opera 4.0 for Linux.</a>
This browser supports direct display of XML documents with attached CSS style sheets.
</p>

<p>
I still don't have
X running on my Linux box, so I can't test this release myself.
I did do a lot of CSS work with the Windows version of Opera recently,
and my experience was that the XML+CSS support was on a par with the latest Mozillas, but no better.
 There were quite a number of bugs and holes and things that didn't work quite right 
 when you started digging past the most basic styles and formats.
 I reported the first couple of bugs I found through Opera's online form, but since I didn't receive any feedback 
 or acknowledgement of those bugs, I didn't feel like wasting my time reporting the next dozen or so I uncovered.
</p>

<p>
There's a moral in this for vendors: If you want users to help you debug your software
on their time, you've got to make it easy for them to do so. 
Accept bug reports in email or on the Web. Let users choose what's more convenient for them, not what's more convenient for you.
Have a genuine human being respond to all bug reports. Don't ask users to waste their time providing you with every last
irrelevant detail of their system. If you need more inforamtion, ask them for it; but don't expect a user to spend 15 minutes 
filling out a form giving you details of every third party extension they've installed, just because one time in
a hundred you might need to know that. In other words, don't try to save your own time at the expense of your users' time!
You've sold the user a buggy product that does not do what you advertised. They're doing you a big favor by reporting 
the problem rather than deleting it, demanding a refund, and detailing to everybody on Usenet just how bad it is. 
You should be grateful for the opportunity to fix the problem.

This "specifies an abstract modularization of XHTML and an implementation of the abstraction using
XML Document Type Definitions (DTDs). This modularization provide a means for subsetting and extending XHTML, a
feature needed for extending XHTML's reach onto emerging platforms." In other words, it lets you mix and match
parts of XHTML like tables or forms with other XML applications like MathML and SVG to create new XML applications.

Microsoft has posted a new beta of their <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/xml/general/msxmlprev.asp">MSXML</a> parser for Windows and Internet Explorer. For the first time, 
they claim this is a  complete implementation of XSLT/XPath 1.0.
They also support the optional SAX2-ext package.
</p>

<p>
It's important to note that the MSXML installer does not actually install  MSXML.
It just places the necessary DLLs on your hard drive.
To actually use the new version,
you'll need to download  
another program called <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/downloads/default.asp?URL=%2Fcode%2Fsample.asp%3Furl=%2Fmsdn-files%2F027%2F001%2F469%2Fmsdncompositedoc.xml">xmlinst.exe</a> and run it to replace the older parser with the newer one.
Previous versions of MSXML 3.0 bundled xmlinst.exe with MSXML, but this release does not.

This is completely up-to-date with the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-xsl-20000327/">March 27, 2000 Last Call working draft of the XSL-FO
specification</a> and <a href="http://xml.apache.org/fop/index.html">FOP 0.14.0</a>.
This is the entire chapter, approximately 70 pages with many full examples
of XSL-FO. </p>

<p>To the best of my knowledge, this is the only comprehensive
tutorial covering the current version of XSL-FO.
Doubtless there are some errors since I was breaking new ground here and had to work from
an incomplete and sometimes contradictory spec document, as well
as using unfinished pre-alpha software. If you spot any mistakes, 
please do let me know so I can fix them.
Otherwise, I hope you like it; and I hope you're now able to start using XSL-FO
for real work!

IBM has released 
version 3.1.0 of their
<a href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/xml4j">XML Parser for Java</a>.
This is based on Xerces-J, which is in turn based on IBM's earlier work on XML4J.
According to IBM, "This release
contains public and stable support of the DOM Level 1, and SAX Level 1
specifications. It also
contains implementations of the DOM Level 2, SAX Level 2 implementations,
and partial April 7
W3C Schema implementations but these are considered experimental, as the
specifications
themselves are still subject to change."

The W3C has elevated the Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2
to Proposed Recommendation status.
All that remains is Tim Berners-Lee's personal approval.
DOM Level 2 is now divided into six modules, which are:

Sean Palmer has published an interesting example of XHTML Modularization
called  <a href="http://xhtml.waptechinfo.com/xsml/">XSML</a> .
XSML differs from XHTML 1.1 in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The <code>base</code> element (module) has been excluded because it's redundant with <code>xml:base</code>. </li>
	<li>The tables module has been replaced by the basic tables module. 
	This means that the  <code>col</code>, <code>colgroup</code>, <code>tbody</code>, <code>thead</code>, and <code>tfoot</code> elements have been removed. </li>
	<li>A  <code>util:comment</code> attributehas been added to the common attributes. </li>
	<li>An <code>xsml:anchor</code> element has been added for use with CSS2. </li>
</ul>

<p>It's important to note that this has all been done by using the 
standard features of XHTML; that is, XHTML 1.1 has been designed speciifcally to make tasks
like this possible. This is an example of the X in XHTML.

The W3C XML Schema Working Group has made a number of changes to
the  syntax of the XML Schema language in 
response to comments received during Last Call,
and have released new working drafts reflecting these changes:
</p>


<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-xmlschema-0-20000922/">XML Schema Part 0: Primer</a> </li>
	<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-xmlschema-1-20000922/http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-xmlschema-1-20000922/">XML Schema Part 1: Structures</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-xmlschema-2-20000922/">XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
The most obvious change is that the namespace URIs have changed.
There are also 
a number of other syntactic changes as well as major rewriting of various sections.
The wroking group has promised an XSLT style sheet that converts the old syntax into the new syntax
shortly.

I've just returned from a brief trip to Las Vegas to do a bit of
XML training. Las Vegas is a city that never fails to upset me, and it's never the
same thing twice. This time I discovered that my hotel, the MGM Grand,
thought that $9.90 a minute was an appropriate rate for phone calls.
They don't actually tell you that of course. It just shows up on your bill when you leave.
No wonder they were so insistent on getting a credit card before they'd turn on the room phone. 
No one in their right mind would agree to pay such extortionate fees. 
Downloading your email and chatting with your kids could cost you more than
a week's stay.
One wonders how they can expect any repeat business with such blatant attempts 
to rip off their customers. I've encountered some ridiculous hotel phone charge before,
but this was by far the worst I've ever seen.
Then again this is the city that was built by the Mob to take advantage of 
 Americans' ignorance of basic math.

<p>
Now that I'm back I'll try and catch up on all the news this weekend.

I've been getting fed up with $1.00 a minute rip-off rates for hotel phones, so I promised myself that
before my next trip I'd finally buy a cell phone. 
I'm also interested in learning about and experimenting with WAP and WML.
Even though I'm 90% convinced this is a fundamentally bad idea,
I still think I should know more about it; and maybe even add a chapter on it to the next edition
of the <cite>XML Bible</cite>. 
</p>

<p>
Thus I'm looking for advice as to what phone I should buy and with which provider I should
sign up.  So far my research seems to say that the Motorola TimePort 7389 is the only commonly available 
phone that supports WAP and WML. Is that accurate? Are there any others? 
This phone isn't offered with the service plans of any of the major companies I've
looked at. How do I know whose networks it will work on? 
</p>

<p>
The final question is how open is WAP? I've been hearing stories that phone companies only let you
access WAP enabled sites that their partners provide. I very much want an open service
that lets me look at any WAP/WML site I want to look at, most especially including my own.
If I'm going to write about this, I need to try it out of course, and I don't want to have
to sign a business deal with a phone company to do that. I want a system that's just as open 
as the wirted Web; where I buy access from an ISP and then look at any site I want to
look at without any hassles. In reverse, I want to buy server space from any ISP and then serve pages
(or WML cards) to any client I want to serve to without making sure that my server has a contract
with the client's phone company. 
</p>

<p>
If you've got opinions or comments about any of these matters, please 
<a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111&#58;elharo%40metalab%2Eunc%2Eedu">drop me a line</a>.
I'll let you know what I eventually do, and then report here on how well the phone and the service
work.

Yesterday, I modified the XSLT stylesheet for a book I'm writing
to account for a slight change in markup. This meant that for the first
time I had to use the <code>preceding</code> and <code>following</code> axes as well as <code>level="any"</code>
on <code>xsl:number</code>.  Something in these changes (I'm still not sure exactly what)
hung my first-resort XSLT processor, 
<A HREF="http://www.jclark.com/xml/xt.html">XT</A> midway through the first chapter, 
so I decided to switch processors and see if that helped. 
</p>

<p>
The first one I tried was <a href="http://xml.apache.org/xalan/index.html">Xalan</a> from the XML Apache Project.
Xalan could handle the document and style sheet (and noticed a couple of problems with the style sheet
that xt wasn't flagging as well). However, it used very different syntax and semantics for some
extension functions I needed; and I didn't feel like rewriting them so I decided to give Michael Kay's
<A HREF="http://users.iclway.co.uk/mhkay/saxon/">SAXON</A> a try.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Wow!</strong> The difference was like night and day.
SAXON blew through in seconds some documents that xt and Xalan were taking several minutes to process.
I haven't done exact timings, but it really wasn't even close. It was like racing a Ferrari against a frog.
 And most importantly SAXON was able to use all the extension functions I'd written for xt without
 even a recompile. It was overly aggressive about indenting the output, which caused some problems
 for preformatted content, but I was able to turn that off with an <code>&lt;xsl:output indent="no"/></code>
  element.  Overall SAXON is now far and away my XSLT processor of choice. It's more conformant to the XSLT 1.0 
  spec than xt and a lot faster and easier to use than Xalan.

You may get infinite loops on some of the pages inside this side and at Cafe au Lait.
I'm working on fixing it, but it may take a little while; especially for pages deep inside the site. 
If you desperately need to get to something, try turning off JavaScript.
 You don't need to report 
any problems right now. I'm aware of them, but there's not a lot I can do about them. 
The webmasters changed the domain name out from under me last night

This describes a form to which any XML document can be reduced. In this process, attribute values are normalized,
character references are resolved, and so forth.
When this process is complete all logically equivalent documents should be byte-for-byte 
equal. The Working Group plans to adavnce this to Candidate Recommendation in about a week.

 Object Model Level 3 (DOM3) specification.
DOM is a language independent API defined in IDL for
representing HTML, XML, SVG, MathML, and similar documents as tree-structured object hierarchies. 
The big new feature of DOM3 is content model support (e.g. DTDs and Schemas). 
There are also numerous minor additions to existing interfaces like <code>Node</code> and <code>Text</code>
as well as a standard means for building and saving DOM <code>Document</code> objects. 
The DOM3 specification is divided into several
documents, one module (or
more if they are strongly related) per document.
Published modules include

Simon St.Laurent
has started a <a href="http://www.simonstl.com/tips/">XHTML Tip of the Day mailing 
list</a> for Web developers interested in XHTML
and XML.  He's starting with fairly basic issues in the changeover from HTML
to XHTML and XML, and will be moving through more advanced material as time goes on.
If you're already on the XHTML-L mailing list, you don't need to subscribe
to this list, as tips will appear on XHTML-L.  Otherwise you can subscribe at the 
<a href="http://www.simonstl.com/tips/">web site</a>. 
This list is a one-way announce list, not a discussion list, so traffic
should be low.

I have a question today: Does anybody out there know a font that contains the standard GUI icons?
e.g. a hand cursor, an arrow, a stopwatch, etc. I can use either 
Mac or Windows icons; either PostScript or TrueType fonts.
I'd naturally prefer a free font I can download quickly, but if I have to pay for it I will.
If you know where I can find such a thing, please

As if there weren't already enough reasons not to use Microsoft
Word or distribute Word documents, The Privacy Foundation has
<a href="http://www.privacyfoundation.org/advisories/advWordBugs.html">discovered</a> that Web bugs can be embedded in Word documents so
that the the author of the document can tell when and where the
document is being read. This could be used to monitor leaks of
confidential documents from a organization (like the Halloween
documents) or to enforce content licensing agreements. 
Furthermore, Word documents can set and get cookies. It's even
possible to "place Web bugs in individual paragraphs and detect
when the text is copied from one Word document to another."

This is good news for those of us nerds with an
abnormal affection for les bandes desin&eacute;es.
(Everyone knows all the cool kids read Japanese comic books. :-) )
It also means that I can finally get 
a copy of the <a href="http://www.amazon.fr/exec/obidos/ASIN/274640088X/">French translation of the 
<cite>XML Bible</cite></a>, as can any of my Francophone readers!
It's called <cite>XML guide de l'utilisateur</cite> and it's actually more current
than the English edition because the translator worked from
the updated chapters posted here on Cafe con Leche. 
I looked for this when I was in
Montreal a couple of weeks ago, but couldn't find it there. The discounts are lower
than in Amazon's American store (only 5% on most products) but 
the strong dollar helps make up for the lower discount in any case.

The W3C has posted a new <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-xhtml-events-20000828">working draft of
XHTML Events specification</a>.
This defines the XHTML Event Module,
 that provides XHTML host languages the ability to
 integrate behaviors with Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2 event interfaces.
 It also defines "the XHTML Basic Event Module, a module which subsets the XHTML Event Module for simpler
applications and simpler client devices, and the XHTML Event Types Module, 
a module defining XHTML language event types."

The W3C has posted 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-xslt11req-20000825">XSL Transformations Requirements Version 1.1</a>.
This is not a specification or even a draft of a specification. rather, it's a 
list of what they want to achieve with XSLT 1.1. From the spec:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The primary goal of the XSLT 1.1 specification is to improve stylesheet portability. This goal will be achieved by standardizing the
mechanism for implementing extension functions, and by including into the core XSLT specification two of the built-in extensions
that many existing vendors XSLT processors have added due to user demand: 
</p>

<ul>
      	<li>Support for multiple output documents from a transformation 
      	<li>Support for converting a result tree fragment to a nodeset for further processing 
</ul>

<p>
By standardizing these extension-related aspects which multiple vendor implementations already provide, the ability to create
stylesheets that work across multiple XSLT processors should improve dramatically. 
</p>

<p>
A secondary goal of the XSLT 1.1 specification is to support the new XML Base (See [XMLBase]) specification.
</p>

Mark Wutka's released
 version 1.7 of <a href="http://www.wutka.com/jox.html">JOX</a> to fix a bug.
JOX is a Java library for reading XML into Java beans and writing XML from
Java beans. Accoding to Wutka, "It is similar to, but not as powerful as, Bill La Forge's
Quick library. The only thing JOX has going for it is that it doesn't
require a separate schema. It uses the bean and optionally a DTD."
JOX is licensed under the LGPL.
</p>

<p>
Wutka has also released version 1.2 of <a href="http://www.wutka.com/beanmaker.html">BeanMaker</a>,
 a set of command-line utilities
 for creating Java Beans using XML. "BeanMaker reads an XML file
containing a description of a bean - really just the bean name, package,
properties and indexed properties - and generates a Java class
implementing that bean. It mainly saves you some typing time when you need
to implement a lot of properties.

BeanMaker also includes a class called XMLIntrospector that looks at an
XML file and generates a set of XML bean definitions that BeanMaker can
then turn into beans. The introspector tries to parse data items as
various Java data types and makes a list of the types that could be used
for every occurrence of a tag. "

This is a good thing for GPL fans like myself. Still, it's going to be a big honking mess, because now they have to go get
permission from everyone who submitted a patch or line of code under the MPL to also release it under the GPL.
GPL'd Mozilla may not include quite everything MPL'd Mozilla does. 
Still and all, this is good news. I've been working with Mozilla a lot lately and its XML support
in the latest Milestone 17 is a little better than Opera 4.0's and light-years ahead of Internet Explorer 5.5.

One of the more interesting things I learned in 
Montreal last week was just what a grvoe is.
Groves allow
addressing and linking into data for which a property set has been defined.
The property set describes how to represent a particular data format as an XML-like tree.
Imagine using the DOM to process RTF to give yourself an idea of the power of this idea.
<a href="http://openhealth.org/XSet/">XSet</a> is an XML property set description of XML 1.0 and XML namespaces
 "to enable grove based processing of formats defined in EBNF"
such as XML itself. 
</p>
<hr />
<p>
<a href="http://www.thefaactory.com/xlink2html">XLink2HTML</a> is
a set of XSLT stylesheets for creating HTML
representations of Xlink elements.
It is particularly useful for representing one-to-many arcs from local resources
to locators. However, other relationships possible in an inline xlink
element are implemented (e.g. many resources to many locators).
</p>

<p>
4xt has published a

<p>
I'm still catching up on news that piled up while I was in Montreal.
Today, I wanted to check in with the W3C. The big news of the last week was the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-xml-2e-20000814">draft of XML 1.0, second edition</a>. This isn't a change to XML itself for the most part,
just a clarification and update of the specification document that corrects various errata that have 
been discovered over the last two years. In a few cases, such as the requirements for 
language codes, parsers have implemented behavior based on erroneous interpretations of
unclear sections of the spec so there may be some minor incompatibilities between 
parsers implmenting the first and second edition, but these should be rare, and I think
the W3C would argue these were bugs in the parser in the first case. 
</p>

<p>
The W3C has also posted new working drafts of three other specifications:
</p>
<ul>
      	<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-xmlquery-req-20000815">XML Query Requirements</a> </li>
	<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-xhtml-forms-req-20000821">XForms Requirements</a> </li>
      	<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-xforms-datamodel-20000815">XForms 1.0: Data Model</a> </li>
</ul>
   
 <p>
XForms are an XML Schema based replacement for and upgrade to
 standard HTML 4.0 forms. XML Query can be thought of as SQL for XML, that is a language for extracting data
 from XML documents and collections of XML documents
  that's more powerful and general than XPath. 
</p>  
   
   <p>
   As I mentioned on Monday, the W3C announced in Montreal
that they have officially decided not to decide what to
do about relative namespace URIs for the time being (though that decision doesn;t seem
to have propagated to the main mailing lists yet). 
They will deprecate them, that is recommend that no one use them, but they will not forbid their use, at least
not yet; and they will not venture to say what they do or do not mean or how they are or are not to
be compared. This issue may be revisted in the future. 
      </p>
      <p>
Meanwhile XFragment seems to be stuck in perpetual limbo, having gone nowhere in the last year,
and the W3C has announced that
they aren't really working on it anymore.  If there's a popular outcry, it may get unstuck.
Otherwise, it's probably dead. 
 Rick Jelliffe has released a very early alpha of
<a href="http://gate.sinica.edu.tw/%7Ericko/src/">Fragserver</a>
to serve XML fragments in response to XPath expressions.
He's looking for people who might have time to adopt and develop it. 
</p>

<p>
Outside the W3C, 
the IESG is considering  
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-murata-xml-07.txt">XML Media Types</a> as a Proposed Standard.  
The IESG plans to make a decision in the next few weeks.  Please send any comments to the

 Dave Beckett's posted a beta of 
 <a href="http://www.redland.opensource.ac.uk/">Redland</a>,
 an RDF Application Framework that allows plugging in of
   various modules to support different parsers, storage mechanisms or
   models. According to Beckett
Redland provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>A modular, object based library (or application framework) written in C</li>
<li>APIs for manipulating the RDF Model and parts - Statements, Resources and Literals</li>
<li>Parsers for importing the model from RDF/XML syntax (both parsers external)</li>
<li>Storage for models in memory and persistant, via Berkeley DB</li>
<li>Query APIs for the model by Statement or by Nodes and Arcs</li>
<li>Statement Streams can be used as well as static APIs for construction, parsing, (de-)serialisation of models</li>
<li>Internal utility classes such as Lists, Hashes, Digests, URI, and Iterators</li>
<li>The parsers, storage, hashes and digests are all modules that can be removed or added to at run time.</li>

<hr />
<p>
Various parties have put together a proposal for

<a href="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/">RSS 1.0</a> 
RSS ("RDF Site Summary") is a lightweight multipurpose
extensible metadata description and syndication format.  RSS is
an XML application, conforms to the W3C's RDF Specification
and is extensible via XML-namespace and/or RDF based modularization.
RSS is also known as the Rich Site Summary,
and in version 0.91 it more or less abandoned its roots in RDF.
(It isn't so careful about XML either. I've found a lot of 
malformed RSS out there in the wild, far more so than I've seen with
any other XML application.)
RSS 1.0 is an effort to attempt to drag RSS back to its RDF-metadata roots.
Given the personalities and philosophies involved,
I'm frankly skeptical that this effort can succeed.
Interested parties are invited to join a working group on the
<a href="http://www.egroups.com/group/rss-dev">RSS-DEV mailing list</a>

I spent the last week in Montreal, sighstseeing and attending the 
Exterme Markup Languages 2000 Conference where I delivered a <a href="slides/extreme/jdom/">talk
about JDOM</a>. I've written up my impressions of the city 
<a href="http://www.macfaq.com/journal/montreal.html">elsewhere</a>. Now I wanted to say a few words about 
what took place at the conference. 
</p>

<p>
Overall, this was a relatively academic conference. Papers were very high level but mostly 
practical. Topic maps were the main topic of the conference, probabaly occupying a third 
of the sessions. However, I found it difficult to muster a lot of interest in them.
Groves were also popular, and seemed somewhat more interesting to me. Imagine using the DOM to
access any kind of data at all, not just XML but also relational databases, Microsoft Word files,
plain text, and more; alkl through a common tree-based API. The architectural forms partisans either
passed on this conference or were amazingly quiet for a change. 
</p>

<p>
There was one major announcement at the conference: The W3C has officially decided not to decide what to
do about relative namespace URIs for the time being.
They will deprecate them, that is recommend that no one use them, but they will not forbid their use, at least
not yet; and they will not venture to say what they do or do not mean or how they are or are not to

I'm back from Montreal. The net access from my hotel was poor, but otherwise I absolutely adored the city.
It struck me as the best parts of New York, Boston, New Orleans, and San Francisco all rolled into one city
with all the bad parts removed. 
I'd be very tempted to pick up shop and move there, but my wife's a lot less enamored of French
than I am.  Then again, I did arrive during what one cabbie told me was the first decent week of weather this century,
and I'm afraid he may have understood that 2000 is the last year of the 20th century rather than the first of the 21st.
I'm going to spend today writing up some thoughts from the trip, most of which have nothing to do with computers.
Tomorrow, I'll try to catch up with all the news items that have piled up over the week while I was away.

I'm leaving for Montreal this afternoon to attend the 
Extreme Markup Languages 2000 conference. I'm giving a brief talk on 
JDOM Wednesday afternoon, but mostly I'll just be listenting to everyone else talk
and doing a bunch of sight-seeing and shopping.
My wife Beth tells me that Montreal has lots of wonderful French bookstores. 
</p>

<p>
 Depending on what sort of Net access
I have while I'm there, updates may be a little slow here for the next week.
When I was in Atlanta last month, the Courtyard Marriott I stayed at had wonderful
Net access, essentially a T-1 to my room for about $10.00 a day. 
The staff told me they're rolling this out all over the country,
and are about half done. 
They also had a genuine 
laundromat on the premises and no ridiculously overpriced minibar. 
It was definitely a step-up from the San Jose/Santa Clara hotels I've stayed at lately,
where they think that Net access means an extra phone jack for your modem, and 
$1.00 a minute phone calls. 
In the future when I have a choice I'm definitely looking for Courtyard Marriott again. 
However, in Montreal I'm staying at the conference hotel (The Hotel Wyndham Montreal) 
so I don't yet know what I'm likely to find when I arrive. My wife's more concerned 
aboiut whether or not the pool's heated. :-)

I've posted the <a href="slides/xmlsig/jdom/">notes from last night's talk about JDOM</a>
to the XML SIG of the New York Object Developers' Group.
This is one of the most complete introductions to JDOM
available anywhere and is completely up-to-date as
of Friday's CVS build. Now I've got to figure out how to 
cut this down to just the bare essentials for a startlingly short half-hour

  extracts data from the data sources and assembles the data into XML documents conforming to
  that DTD.

Tonight, Tuesday August 8,
I'm giving an introductory talk about JDOM to
 the XML SIG of the Object Developers Group in New York.
 
JDOM is a tree-based, Java API for processing XML documents that's been
designed with simplicity and convenience as its foremost purposes. JDOM
programs can use any commonly available SAX or DOM parser. At a high
level, it's similar to the DOM, but since JDOM was designed specifically
for Java rather than for multiple languages, it feels much more natural
and "right" to Java programmers. This talk teaches you how to use the
JDOM to read and write XML documents from your Java programs while
automatically maintaining well-formedness and checking validity.
</p>
 
 <p>
 The meeting takes place from 7-9 p.m., at <a href="http://www.objdev.org/directions/goldmansachs.html">Goldman Sachs, 125 Broad Street,
19th Floor, Room B in Manhattan in the Wall Street area</a>. 
Admission is free. However, you must
 register for this session by sending an  email to
<a href="mailto:wperry@fiduciary.com.">wperry@fiduciary.com.</a> 
You will receive a confirmation by
return email. <strong>You need to register in advance to get into the building</strong>.

This document defines what information a namespace-aware XML parser should reveal to
applications, and precisely defines those inforamtion items.
This spec is necessary because until now many other specs like XSLT and DOM have had subtle but
potentially dangerous inconsistencies in how they define key terms like the value of a node.
This is required reading for anybody working on XML APIs or software or on other
XML specifications. However, for the rest of the community it's pretty technical.

If you're in Atlanta tonight (Monday),  come hear me
talk about 
<strong>Java 1.4 and Beyond</strong> at the 
<a href="http://www.ajug.org/meetings/">Atlanta Java User's Group</a>.  
Now that Java 1.3 has been officially released, it's time to explore both
where Java is going in the future and where it should go (which may or may
not be the same place). What's ahead for the Java language and libraries?
Will Java ever get templates, operator overloading, and multiple
inheritance? Perhaps more to the point, should it get these constructs? Will
Java I/O ever be fast enough for data intensive work? Will your network
programs be allowed access to the raw IP layer so ping or traceroute can be
written in Java? 
The meeting runs from from 7 P.M. to
9 P.M. and is held at  the Ravinia Conference
Center near Perimeter Mall. Directions are on the <a href="http://www.ajug.org/meetings/">AJUG web site</a>. 
As usual, I'll be posting the notes from my talk here on Cafe au Lait
after the talk. However, the notes are quite skimpy compared to what I'll be saying, so you
definitely want to attend if you can. Tomorrow I'll be at the Georgia Web 
Developers Conference where I'll be talking about <cite>XML Fundamentals</cite>
and <cite>Web Client Programming in Java</cite>.

I've opened a <a href="reports/ie55.html">special report on Internet Explorer 5.5</a>. 
Comments are welcome. 
</p>
</dd>
	<dt>Wednesday, July 12, 2000</dt><dd>
		

<p>
Microsoft's released <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/download/ie55.htm">Internet Explorer 
5.5 for Windows</a>.
This release includes a lot of XML support.
CSS support is expanded. A print preview function has been added. 
I don't yet know whether or not this supports real XSLT as opposed to 
the pseudo-XSLT
IE5 used. 
More news as I try it out.  
</p>

<p>
OK, I've installed it and ran some simple test files at it and I am sad to report that
<strong>IE 5.5 failed almost all my tests quickly, obviously, and immediately. </strong>
It does a worse job on XML pages with XSLT stylesheets
than the latest beta of MSXML3 that I had running with IE5.
Many other known bugs and annoyances
have yet to be fixed. In particular:
</p>


<ul>
<p>
<li>The open file dialog still doesn't let you select XML files. To open an XML file
you have to select All Files. </li>
</p>
<p>
<li>Some long-standing bugs in handling of entity declarations in DTDs remain.
This means IE5.5 is still unable to parse the 
<a href="http://www.w3c.org/TR/REC-xml">XML 1.0 specification</a> and many
of Jon Bosak's marked up Shakespeare plays, 
<a href="http://metalab.unc.edu/xml/examples/shakespeare/all_well.xml"><cite>All's Well that Ends 
Well</cite></a>, for just one example.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
While IE5.5 finally recognizes the
correct namespace URI for XSLT, it does not recognize the correct MIME type (text/xml, not text/xsl). 
Furthermore, it has some major problems with XSLT 1.0 stylesheets.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I cut Microsoft a lot of slack for IE5, probably more than I should have.
 What they provided in IE5 was a reasonable implementation of what was then the current draft
 specification. However, the XSLT 1.0 spec preceded IE5.5 by more than half a year, and 
 Microsoft still hasn't gotten it right! At this point,  I can only attribute their failure 
 to
 incompetence or malice. Take your pick. 
</p>



<hr>
<p>
The Apache XML Project has released <a href="http://xml.apache.org/xalan/index.html">Xalan-J 1.1</a>,
their XSLT processor written in Java.
Most importantly Xalan-J now works with
the current version of Xerces-J, 1.1.2 (<i>.jar</i> included)
Also the ANT build script should finally work.
The major API change is that 
a Xerces-specific URI class now replaces the <code>java.net.URL</code> 
class when resolving system IDs for
                    external entities. 
         Because of this, Xalan now requires you to use real file URLs like 
file:///c:/foo/bar.xml instead of c:\foo\bar.xml. However, the command line processor 
         continues to work as before. 
Java 1.1.8 or later is required.

I already mentioned the release of <a href="http://www.opera.com/download.html">Opera 4.0 for Windows</a> with full suport for XML and CSS
a couple of weeks ago, but I just found out about one new feature in this release that's so
important I thought I'd bring it up again. Opera 4.0 has customizable cookie filtering that
lets you disallow third party cookies, any cookie from a particular website, 
  or write your own cookie filter that lets you eliminate cookies you don't want.
  This sort of privacy enhancing technology ought to be built into all browsers.
  The current choices between all cookies and no cookies are simply too limiting.

specification</a>.
SVG is an XML application describing vector

John Wilson has released the first 
production version of <a href="http://www.wilson.co.uk/xml/minml.htm">MinML</a>,
a parser of an XML-like language
intended for embedded Java systems. 
The big omission is mixed content.
The API is SAX 1.0.
While this might be useful in some applications,
I really wish the word "XML" wasn't used anywhere in reference to it.
This is not an XML parser, and it will fail to parse many well-formed
XML documents.
I think products like this will only confuse most devleopers who really do want 
and need a fully
XML compliant parser.
Not all languages have to be XML and not all parsers have to parse XML;
but parsers that parse some other language shouldn't call themselves
"a minimal XML parser" when they don't even try to meet the minimal requirements of 
the XML 1.0 spec.

<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/CR-xlink-20000703/">XLink</a> has now been promoted 
to candidate recommendation stage.
The major addition to this draft is the <code>xlink:arcrole</code> attribute. 
This can be attached to simple XLinks and arcs.
It serves the same purpose for arc resources as the 
<code>xlink:role</code> does for extended, simple, locator, and resource elements.
(I haven't yet figured out why arcs deserve special treatment.)
Furthermore, the specification now requires that the value of both <code>xlink:role</code> and <code>xlink:arcrole</code>
attributes must be a URI that identifies a resource describing the intended
property rather than the description itself. 
</p>

<p>
The <code>undefined</code> value for the <code>xlink:show</code> and <code>xlink:actuate</code> 
attributes has been renamed <code>other</code>. 
Furthermore, <code>xlink:show</code> and <code>xlink:actuate</code> can no longer have arbitrary values but are now limited to the
values defined in the spec: <code>onLoad</code>, 
<code>onRequest</code>, <code>other</code>, and <code>none</code> for <code>xlink:actuate</code>
and <code>new</code>,
<code>replace</code>, <code>embed</code>, <code>other</code>, 
and <code>none</code> for <code>xlink:show</code>. 
</p>
<p>
Linkbases are more fully described as is the behavior of applications processing
linkbases. 
Otherwise, I haven't found any major changes in this draft.

<a href="http://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/DVS1/staff/bourret/xmldbms/xmldbms.htm">XML-DBMS</a>,
an open source package "for transferring data between XML
documents and relational databases. It views the XML document as a tree of
document-specific objects (not the DOM) in which element types are generally
viewed as classes and attributes and PCDATA as properties of those classes.
It then uses an object-relational mapping to map these objects to the
database....An XML-based mapping language is used to define the view and map it to the
database. This language is very flexible, allowing users to do basic tasks
such as renaming elements and attributes for storage in the database, as
well as providing more advanced capabilities, such as handling namespaces,
defining how null data is treated, and defining date formats." 
This release fixes a few bugs and 
adds some new and revised samples, as well as better documentation for
the beginning user.

Unidex has released 
<a href="http://www.unidex.com/xflat.htm">XML Convert 2.0</a> , a ridiculously expensive
$1,000 payware
Java program for converting
flat text files to XML and
vice versa. Version 2.0
adds the ability
to convert from one flat file format to another
as well as better integration with SAX and James Clark's XT.
All of this is accomplished by writing an XFlat schema that describes the transformation.
</p>

<p>
I took a look at the last beta of XML Convert
for a project I was working on that required me to convert a few 
meagabytes of tab delimited data to XML. However, I
 quickly decided that it would be a lot easier to hack together a solution in Java,
AppleScript,
and FileMaker rather than learning yet another language (XFlat schema).
It probably would have been even easier to do the job if my Perl wasn't so rusty.
It might be more worthwhile if you had a more frequent need to do this sort of job,
but I suspect that for most of us, our occasional needs to do this sort of thing 
are better met by using
Perl to go from flat files to XML and XSLT to go from XML to flat files.

OASIS, has opened the <a href="http://www.xml.org/registry/">XML.ORG</a> 
Registry to the public. This is allegedly a directory of
 XML specifications and

However it doesn't appear to be very useful, at least not yet.
I tried four searches for "math", "legal", "chemistry", and
"health"; all areas in which I know there's a lot of
important XML work going on.  Every one of them reported
"No matches found."
I suggest, only half facetiously, that OASIS take whatever budget they've allocated for this project

The W3C XML Linking 
Working Group has promoted <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/CR-xptr-20000607">XPointer</a> 
to candidate recommendation.
XPointer is an XPath based, non-XML syntax for identifying particular nodes and node sets
in XML documents. 
It is not yet implemented outside of experimental software.
</p>

<p>
One major new development in this release is that "The W3C
Director has been informed of a Patent (<a
href="http://patent.womplex.ibm.com/details?patent_number=5659729">U.S.
Patent 5659729</a>, issued 19 Aug 1997 to Sun Microsystems) that
may cover parts of XPointer. As of June 7 2000, W3C did not
receive an official answer from the patent owner on this issue."
The specific patent in question describes a "Method and system
for implementing hypertext scroll attributes". The author is 
Jakob Nielsen.
This is particularly galling since Sun employee 
Eve Maler is one of the primary editors of the specification.
I hope this is simply an accident, and not another example 
of a company trying to get their patented technology adopted by a 
satndards body so they can extort royalties from anybody who implements the
standard. 
</p>

<p>
Other changes to the specification since the last draft
seem to mostly reflect editorial decisions and clarifications.
For instance, the rules for escaping XPointers in both URIs and XML atttributes
are laid out in much greater detail. 
The actual XPointer syntax has not changed very much at all. 
There are two new functions. The <code>range-to()</code> function for
creating a range that starts from the context node and extends to the 
argument given to the function. The <code>unique()</code> function returns 
true if and only if there's exactly one node in the context node list.Otherwise it returns false.
That is it tells you whether or not your XPath points to exactly one thing or not.

The W3C XML Linking 
Working Group has  also 
published a second last call 
working draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlbase">XBase</a>.

The W3C has posted two notes from Sun for the
 <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/jsgf/">JSpeech Grammar Format</a>
 and the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/jsml">JSpeech Markup Language</a>.

  The JSpeech Grammar Format defines a non-XML syntax for 
  encoding the valid responses at given moments in a program's life. For instance, a very simple grammar
  may say that in response to a particular question, the user must answer "Yes" or "No".
  It makes speech recognition more accurate by limiting the words that may be spoken 
  and commands that may be given
  at any one time. 
  The is an XML application for annotating text that will be spoken by
  a  computer to imporve its quality. For instance, JSML lets you specify
  the pronunciation of a word or say that 
  a particular phrase should be spoken louder to emphasize it. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
   
 Aside from name changes, these are the same as Sun's previously published 
  <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/speech/forDevelopers/JSGF/index.html">Java Speech API Grammar Format 1.0</a> and 
  <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/speech/forDevelopers/JSML/index.html">Java 
  Speech Markup Language 0.6</a>. The names have been changed to protect Sun's 
  Java trademark while these to be developed under the W3C process. 
The W3C is obligated to post notes submitted by member organizations like Sun,
but they aren't obligated to endorse or do anything with them. 
These two specs will probably be developed within
the Voice Browser Working Group, however.

The W3C XML Signature Working Group

of XML-Signature Syntax and Processing </a>
and a new <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-xml-c14n-20000601">working draft of
Canonical XML Version 1.0</a>. These are two closely related standards.
Canonical XML defines when two XML documents are effectively the same 
although they're not byte-for-byte identical.
For instance, changing the document encoding,
adding white space to attribute values, or 
reordering attributes would not create a canonically different XML document.
 XML-Signature Syntax and Processing describes a method for calculating
  digital signatures for and attaching digital signatures to
 XML documents. Signatures are calculated with respect to the canonical form of an XML document.
</p>

<p>
The big change in the Canonical XML specification is the use of the 
XPath data model instead of the 
XML InfoSet data model. The biggest changes to the definition of canonical XML are
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Comments are no longer stripped. Two documents that differ only in their comments
	are no longer considered the same.</li>
	<li>Namespace prefixes are no longer rewritten and the default namespace is 
	allowed.</li>

<a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/4.0/index.html">Version 4 of DocBook</a> has been released.
Version 4 brings much-anticipated XML compatibility to
DocBook.  DocBook is an SGML
(and now XML) application for technical documentation.
It's been used for some O'Reilly books
(indeed, version 1.0 was invented by O'Reilly's
production department) as well as for large parts of the Linux Documentation Project.
</p>

<p>
DocBook, in either SGML or XML, is actually quite large.
Norm Walsh has written a <a href="http://www.nwalsh.com/docbook/simple/index.html">simplified version
of the DocBook DTD</a>
that's suitable for small articles, essays, HowTos and the like that don't need
tables of contents, cover pages, indexes, and the other effluvia of a full-fledged book. 
Documents written against this DTD should still validate against the full DTD.

the 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-query-datamodel-20000511">XML Query Data Model</a>, the first half
of the XML Query Language. The second half, the XML Query Algebra, remains to be published.
An instance of this model represents one or more complete XML documents or

to reach that data. 
From the draft:

<blockquote>
<p>The XML Query Data Model defines formally the information contained in the input to an XML Query
processor; in other words, an XML Query processor evaluates a query on an instance of the XML Query

David Megginson's released the final version of <a href="http://www.megginson.com/SAX/Java/index.html">SAX 2.0,
the Simple API for XML</a>.
SAX 2.0 is a cross-language, cross-platform
(though Java is best supported), event-based API for processing XML documents.
To use SAX, you implement the <code>ContentHandler</code> interface
and register your implementation with an XML parser like Xerces. As the parser reads the document,
it calls back to methods in your <code>ContentHandler</code> such as
<code>startElement()</code> and <code>characters()</code> to tell you what it sees in the document
as it sees it. 
</p>

<p>
SAX 2.0 is a major change from SAX 1.0. While SAX 1.0 classes and interfaces are still supported, almost all of
them have been deprecated. The primary cause of this was namespace support which required changes to 
many method signatures. Changes from the last beta of SAX2 are relatively minor however.

(Most other parsers only support earlier betas at this point.)
Schema support is improved in this release, but hardly complete yet. 
There are also lots of other bug fixes and performance enhancements.

 Keith Moore of the University of Tennessee has written an important Internet Draft

Questions addressed include:
</p>

<blockquote> for a given application that is layered on top of HTTP:

<ul>
<li>Should the application use a different port than the HTTP default
     of 80?</li>

<li>    Should the application use traditional HTTP methods (GET, POST,
     etc.) or should it define new methods?</li>

<li>    Should the application use http: URLs or define its own prefix?</li>

<li>    Should the application define its own MIME-types, or use something
     that already exists (like registering a new type of MIME-directory
     structure)?</li>

XML documents from Java that is allegedly 
simpler and more natural to Java developers 
than SAX or DOM. From my initial peek at the API documentation,
I suspect that may be true.
However, I did note some problems with namespace support.
Adapters are included for SAX and DOM
parsers in general as well as Xerces in particular. Current version is 1.0b3. 
Java 2 (or at least Java 1.1 plus the Collections API) is required.

Meanwhile, on the Python side of the XML fence,
Sean McGrath's has published 
<a href="http://xml.com/pub/2000/04/26/rax/index.html">RAX: An XML Database API
for Python</a>.
This API is designed to make parsing data-oriented XML documents
much simpler than they would be when parsed with SAX or DOM.
However, this API is relatively limited in terms of the documents 
it can handle.

Various XSLT implementors are developing two
vendor/XML parser/XSLT processor-independent APIs that attempt
to do for XSLT what SAX and DOM do for XML
(that is, let code written to the common API not 
run with any 
underlying processor). These are:
</p>


<ul>
<li> <a href="http://trax.openxml.org/">TRaX</a>, TRansformations for Xml, a generic API for all forms of transformations
including but not limited to XSLT<P>
 
<li>  The <a href="http://trax.openxml.org/">Serialize</a> API for
serializing DOM trees  and SAX events to a stream contributed
by  by Assaf Arkin
from ExOffice<P>
 </ul>
 
 <p>
 Both are written in Java and depend on SAX2, though this
 may change. Nothing is written in stone yet.
The participation of the broader XML community
in helping to define these APIs is actively solicited.

<img src="images/sd2k_logo.gif" alt="Software Development 2000 Conference Logo" align=left width="158" height="119" border="0" hspace="10" vspace="10"><p>
The <a href="http://www.sdexpo.com/speakers/abstracts.html">call for proposals for SD2000 East</a>, 
to be held  in Washington D.C. from October 29th to November 2nd, 2000, is up.
I chair the XML track for this conference and we're looking for proposals that cover the 
broad range of XML technologies. 
</p>

<p>
The audience for this show is very developer heavy.
Attendees tend to be programmers working in the trenches to implement solutions.
The evaluation forms tell us they want meaty, technical talks that show by example 
how to use XML/Java/C++/etc. Thus in the XML track we're looking for talks
that pick one aspect of XML (e.g. schemas, XLinks, DOM, etc.) and explain and 
demonstrate it in as much detail as is feasible in 90 minutes. 
</p>

<p>
Our audience is not very patient with vague presentations that hype
technologies without actually showing them in action. 
In particular, we really don't need more broad, overview introductions to XML
and why it's cool. What we do need are presentations on specific topics like 
<cite>SOAP</cite> or <cite>Processing XML with Python</cite> that spend maybe 1/4 to 1/3 
of the time explaining why that particular technology is useful, 
(not why XML in general is useful, assume the audience already knows that) 
and the rest of the time actually
showing the audience how to use the technology you're presenting. 
</p>

<p>
As well as XML, SD2000 East will offer tracks covering
 Linux Servers, C++ Programming, Component Based Development, 
COM, Enterprise Application Integration, Java,
Methods & Modeling, Internet Application Development,
and E-Commerce. There's also some interest in offering a few seminars about
extreme programming and/or wireless applications.
We haven't quite decided which track to put those in yet--it may well depend 
on exactly what the abstracts propose--but if you do submit abstracts
in those areas, they'll be considered quite seriously. 
Aside from giving a few Java talks, I don't  
have direct involvement with these other tracks, but proposals 
are solicited for these as well. 
Deadline for abstracts is May 1, and they may be 
submitted online 
at <a href="http://www.sdexpo.com/speakers/abstracts.html">http://www.sdexpo.com/speakers/abstracts.html</a>.

Don Park has released
<a href="http://www.docuverse.com/min/">Min 1.0A2, a Java Minimal XML parser</a>.  This parser parses 
a restricted subset of XML known as <a href="http://www.docuverse.com/smldev/minxmlspec.html">Minimal XML or
SML</a>.
It supports SAX 1.0 and JAXP (Java API for XML Parsers).
You can download the distribution ZIP file at:
It includes  a command line program for
converting XML files into MinXML files. 
</p>

<p>Min is allegedly twice as fast as at least one full-blown XML
parser, Sun's JAXP parser, though the time savings is only about 50%.
In my opinion, this is 
not worth the non-standardness. I'd want to see at least an order of magnitude 
improvement to consider this worthwhile. Minimal XML leaves out a <strong>LOT</strong> including:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Attributes

	<li>CDATA Sections

	<li>Comments

	<li>Document Type Declarations

	<li>Empty-Element Tags

	<li>Entity References

	<li>Mixed Content

	<li>Predefined Entities

	<li>Processing Instructions

	<li>Prolog

	<li>XML Declaration
</ul>
<p>
Bascially all that's left are elements that contain other elements and elements that contain
#PCDATA as well as the well-formedness rules. I don't think enough documents meet these constraints to
make it worth a separate parser. 
I'd also like to see Min compared
to other parsers, xp and Xerces in particular.

Microsoft's posted a preview release of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/downloads/webtechnology/ie/iepreview.asp">Internet Explorer 5.5 for Windows</a>.
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/voices/ie55.asp">New features</a> include element
behaviors, colored scrollbars, editable regions, HTML+TIME and zooming.
CSS support is improved (though still incomplete) with
border, padding, and margin propertiess  on inline elements, the
<code>first-letter</code> and <code>first-line</code> pseudo-selectors, and vertical text layout.
Microsoft hasn't said anything about XSLT support, but I suspect it's at about the level of the MSXML 3 DLL
released a few weeks ago; that is, incomplete support for the final XSLT 1.0 specification. 
As usual, Microsoft preview software should not be trusted. 
Run this only on machines dedicated to beta testing only where you won't mind if
you have to wipe the hard

Sun's released version 1.0
of the <a href="http://java.sun.com/xml/download.html">Java API for XML Parsing (JAXP) 1.0</a>, 
a standard extension for Java 1.1 and later. 
This spec is mostly comprised of three parts, two of which are obsolete.
The first part is SAX1. The second part is DOM Level 1.
The third part comprises classes for locating and instantiating parsers. 
SAX1 and DOM1 are both obsolete (for instance SAX1 doesn't have any explicit 
namespace support)
so I recommend that 
most programmers using Java to process XML simply jump straight to SAX2 or DOM2 
via Xerces-J, and ignore this release. 
In fact, Sun has already started a new <a href="http://java.sun.com/aboutJava/communityprocess/jsr/jsr_063_jaxp11.html">Java Specification 
Request
for the Java API for XML Parsing 1.1</a> that updates JAXP to SAX2 and DOM2.
Why they couldn't wait and do it right the first time, I'll never know. 
</p>

<p>
As usual the spec is only available in PostScript and PDF formats, not HTML.
Scott McNealy did a good thing when he banned PowerPoint from Sun. 
Now if we can just get him to ban FrameMaker as well, maybe we can get some 
specs written 
in HTML that people can actually read.

<p>
Netscape's posted <a href="http://home.netscape.com/download/previewrelease.html">Netscape 6 Preview 1</a>, 
a bleeding-edge pre-beta that supports direct display of XML+CSS in the browser.
This is based on the Mozilla source code, and is available for Windows, Linux 
and the Mac. 
Lots of bugs have been reported up to and including crashing systems and
deletion of old bookmark files, especially with the
Macintosh version. Exercise extreme caution before installing. 
I don't recommend this for production systems, only for 
non-mission critical CPUs used for testing beta software.

The W3C XSL Working Group has posted a

  XSL-FO is now in last call until April 30, 2000.
  Given the unstable 
and incomplete nature of the very few XSL-FO renderers that
currently exist, I hope the W3C exhibits an unusual level of caution with
this and does not set a definite date for the end of the
 Candidate
Recommendation phase, but instead waits to see whether or not the full spec
is actually implementable.

This browser supports direct display of XML, and has much
better support of CSS Level 1 than does IE5 for Windows.
However, XSLT support is limited to the very old December, 1998
working draft that IE5 for Windows supports.
IE5 Mac also supports XHTML without
any compromises, the first browser to do so.

OpenTransport 1.2, twelve megabytes of disk space

The W3C XML Core Working Group
 has posted the
 first public Working Draft  of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-xinclude-20000322">XInclude</a>.
XInclude defines an 
<code>&lt;xinclude:include href="<i>URI</i>"/&gt;</code> 
element whose effect is to
insert the referenced XML document into the document
in place of the <code>xinclude:include</code> element
after validation. (Whether to allow replacement
to take place before validation is being discussed.) 
You can specify whether you want the included content to
be parsed as XML or inserted as raw text with all illegal
characters like &lt; escaped as necessary.
</p>
<p>
Interestingly, this proposal also suggests that the correct interpretation
of the <code>xlink:show="embed"</code> attribute of an XLink element 
is to graphically embed the  content referenced
in the XLink, but not to consider it part of the
including document. The XLink specification itself is silent on exactly how
<code>xlink:show="embed"</code>
should be interpreted.
</p>
<p>
The intention seems to be that XML parsers like Xerces
will implement XInclude, perhaps as a settable property.
However, it should be straight-forward to write a SAX filter
that adds XInclude behavior in the meantime, or alternately a simple
static method that takes a DOM <code>Document</code> object as an argument
and returns a new <code>Document</code> in which all the text has been
included. For example, 
</p>
<p><code>public static Document mergeIncludes(Document doc) throws SAXException,
IOException</code></p>
<p>
I do something very much like this for my various 
<a href="slides/">presentation notes</a>, though so far I've implemented
it as an XSLT extension function rather than inside the XML processor.

I've received email from a couple of Microsoft developers 
informing me that  nested templates are  in fact not allowed
by the  preview release of
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/downloads/webtechnology/xml/msxml.asp">MSXML3.DLL</a>
as I erroneously claimed here yesterday,
at least in the standard namespace.
They may be allowed in the old namespace for compatibility with previous versions of IE5,
but that's not such a big deal.
The claim that they were suported was based on incorrect documentation on the Microsoft web site.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, I still hold to my claim that Microsoft pays insufficient
obeisance to standards, and that this is a cultural
issue at Microsoft, even if it turns 
out not to be the problem in this particular case.
For one thing, the Microsoft developers who communicated with me over this both
seemed a little bemused by the strong customer demand for standard XSLT.
They clearly felt this was an external requirement imposed on them from the outside
rather than something that was important for its own sake and for Microsoft.
For another,  Bruce Schneier just pointed out to me an unrelated
problem in <a href="http://www.counterpane.com/crypto-gram-0003.html#KerberosandWindows2000">Windows 
2000 support for Kerberos</a> that clearly demonstrates the
same cultural imperatives at work.

Microsoft has posted a new preview release of
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/downloads/webtechnology/xml/msxml.asp">MSXML3.DLL</a>, 
their XML/XSLT processor used inside Internet Explorer 5 for Windows.
This release gets closer to full XSLT 1.0 support, but isn't there yet.
Missing features include:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The <code>document()</code> and <code>key()</code> functions</li>
<li>The <code>decimal-format</code>, <code>strip-space</code>, and 
<code>preserve-space</code> attributes</li>
<li>The <code>preceding</code>, <code>following</code>, <code>preceding-sibling</code>,
and
<code>following-sibling</code> axes in XPath</li>
<li>The <code>xsl:param</code>, <code>xsl:with-param</code>, <code>xsl:number</code>
<code>xsl:import</code> and <code>xsl:apply-imports</code> elements. 
</ul>

<p>
Furthermore, Microsoft has added some decidedly non-standard features 
such as nested templates so
that style sheets written for IE5 may well break when used 
with other, fully-standard
compliant XSLT processors. This seems like more of Microsoft's usual arrogance.
The programmers working on this software 
had what they thought was a good idea, but simply didn't consider 
whether it was more important to be compliant with the standard. In this case
it was even a standard they participated in developing. Microsoft has a cultural
aversion to standards, and this is just one more example.

 <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-1">Part 1: Structures</a> and 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2">Part 2: Datatypes</a>.
There are very few syntax changes in these drafts.
The biggest is probably that
IDREF, IDREFS, ENTITY, ENTITIES, and NOTATION are now primitive types instead
subtypes of string. However most of the changes focus on cleaning up the
specification itself as opposed to the syntax and semantics the specification documents. 
</p>
<p>
More importantly, for the first time there's a new 
"<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-0">Part 0</a>" introducing schema concepts 
in a more tutorial like fashion.
This should help clear up a lot of initial confusion about schemas that has
been promulgated by the more technical Parts 1 and 2.

<p>
Sun has posted version 1.0 of their 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/xml/download.html">Java API for XML Parsing</a> developed 
in Sun's closed, proprietary community process. They have not yet released an actual 
implementation of this specification. The spec is only available in
PostScript and PDF format. 
</p>

<p>
I remain opposed to this API on principle, and I'm happy to note that
there are realistic alternatives like 
<a href="http://www.megginson.com/SAX/">SAX</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2">DOM</a>, 
and <a href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces-j/">Xerces</a>
that have a lot more traction in actual use. Some of these form part of Sun's proprietary API.
What Sun is really trying to do with this API is hijack control of APIs
for XML parsing in Java from more open processes. Sun is simply incapable of
accepting a process for Java standardization that they don't control. 
</p>

<p>
This isn't just a theoretical problem either. For example, here's 
a direct quote from the spec:
</p>

<blockquote>
This specification subsumes the XML Namespaces 1.0 Recommendation in its
entirety. This specification reserves the XML namespace prefixes beginning with
java and javax (case insensitive) for future usage by the Java Platform.
</blockquote>

<p>
This is completely wrong! The whole point of namespaces is that nobody reserves
prefixes. You only get to reserve URLs which are mapped to prefixes
at run time. However, Sun gets apoplectic at the mere thought of anybody else
potentially using the name "Java" so they have to try to grab every possible use of the word 
they can imagine, even if they don't have a clue what they're going to do with it. 
</p>

<p>
Leaving aside for the moment the questions of whether or not Java APIs for XML should be developed
in open, democratic forums or in Sun's closed, proprietary process, there's another question
of whether or not now is the right time to standardize a Java API for XML. I think it's way too early
on the adoption curve to write anything in stone that will only have to be deprecated next week.
Right now I'm working hard on my presentation about Java and XML at SD2000 West in a few weeks.
In the last week, there were three separate releases of software and changed specs that necessitated rewriting
my notes! And I expect that to continue for the next few weeks and beyond.
This is very bleeding edge stuff. Sun's Java API for XML relies on SAX1 which isn't really namespace aware.
SAX2 changes lots of things and deprecates a lot that Sun's writing into their API. Their support of DOM1 instead of DOM2 
has similar problems. If Sun wants to add SAX and DOM to the core Java APIs, then they should at
least wait until those APIs are stable.

The Apache XML Project has released <a href="http://xml.apache.org/dist/">version 0.19.5
of the Xalan XSLT processor</a>. This release fixes assorted bugs that turned up 
in 0.19.4 after it was posted.
Xalan 
is now compiled against Xerces-J 1.0.1
and probably doesn't work with Xerces 1.0.2 release because of the
major changes to the SAX2 API in that release. Of course Xerces 1.0.2 isn't yet up to date
with the latest SAX2 beta. This we're now stuck trying to work with three different version of SAX2.
Yuck. The situation should clear up over time as SAX2 is finalized.

To further complicate matters, the Cocoon project has released version 1.7 of the

This release fixes various bugs, improves memory management, installation
and caching, but presumably it inherits some of Xalan 0.19.4's bugs.
It may work with Xalan 0.19.5 since that release didn't involve any API changes,
but I haven't tested it yet.

Would you believe that after I spent four hours yesterday finding a GUI
CVS client for my NT box, installing it, discovering that it was too 
confusing to use, deinstalling it,
finding a command line client, installing it, discovering that it depended on CYGWIN, finding CYGWIN, downloading it, installing it, downloading the Xerces
source tree, trying to build it, discovering that the Borland make tool wouldn't handle the
Xerces Makefile, discovering that the version of CYGWIN I had installed didn't include make,
deinstalling CYGWIN, downloading and installing the developer's version of CYGWIN that did 
include make, and finally making the entire Java source tree, all so I could work with

a node. The first part is the root node, every part after that is the
child of the preceding part's node. All names must begin with the same
root node, at least for now.

Michel Rodriguez has released <a href="http://standards.ieee.org/resources/spasystem/twig/">XML::Twig 1.9</a>, a
           Perl XML module for  processing XML documents too
           large to load into memory at one time by breaking them up into 
           sub-trees that can be processed sequentially.
           It's available from your local CPAN mirror.

3.0 of the Unicode Specification is now available in 
<a href="http://www.unicode.org/unicode/uni2book/u2.html">printed book form</a>.
This is a major upgrade to Unicode that adds thousands of new characters in many languages.
The most significant new character set supported is Ethiopic.

Various information is available on the <a href="http://www.unicode.org/">Unicode web site</a>,

The W3C's XML Linking Working Group
 has released a new working draft of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-xlink-20000221">XLink</a>
specification. 
This draft changes the namespace again, from http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink/namespace/
to http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink. 
Otherwise the syntax seems unchanged. 
XLink is now in last call with a last call date of March 20, 2000.

The same group 
has also released a new working draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlbase">XBase</a>,

The W3C has posted  a new working draft of
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-css3-userint-20000216">User 
Interface for CSS3</a>. 
CSS1 and CSS2 provide several user interface related
pseudo-classes, properties and values like <code>:link</code> and <code>cursor</code>. This
working draft proposes to extend these to allow elements to be
styled based on their user interface related states, and to let
an arbitrary element look like a 
standard user interface widget.
For instance, you could make an XML <code>PO_BOX</code> element look like
an <code>INPUT type=text</code> form element
(normally a text field) or a <code>STATES</code> element look like a 
<code>SELECT</code> menu (normally a
popup menu). 
It also suggests a CSS mechanism for 
turning on full-screen kiosk mode.

I'm working on my notes for the upcoming XML and Java tutorial at 
<a href="http://www.sdexpo.com/">SDExpo 2000 West</a> on March 20 in San Jose.  
This will be a full day tutorial covering writing XML from Java programs,
reading XML documents with SAX and DOM, connecting XML documents to databases,
and so forth. I'd love to hear from anyone who's got questions about this material.
I'm trying to find out what people would want to see in apresentation of this
nature. In particular, I'm looking for examples of the
"How do I write a program to do X?" category. Even if you can't attend the conferewnce, I will
post the notes here when I'm done for everyone to learn from one, and I may eventually turn this
into a book. Please email me suggestions at

New extension functions in this release include: </p>
<ul>
<li><code>saxon:distinct()</code> removes nodes with
the same values from a nodeset<P>

<li><code>saxon:evaluate()</code> returns a string built from  an XPath
expression constructed at runtime<P>

<li><code>saxon:tokenize()</code> converts a string into a
nodeset containing one node for each token value in the string<P> 
</ul>

LinuxWorld was fun. I'll probably go back tomorrow and bring my digital 
camera to take some pictures.
There wasn't a lot of XHTML. Enhydra was there, 
as usual failing to explain exactly what it was their product did
or why I would want one. (I asked. The guy at the booth literally could not tell me,
and admitted as much.) 
At least it's open source, unlike all the
other application server vendors who want to charge me $100,000 or more for a product
they can't explain. Am I just dense or is there really "no there, there"
in the application server market? BlueStone sends me at least three press releases 
a week, but still hasn't managed to explin what it is they actually do.

The one XML topic people were talking about was XHTML. The W3C has royally screwed the pooch
in marketing this.  Everybody had heard of it,
but nobody  knew what it actually was. Opinions  were equally divided between 
XHTML being a replacement
for XML and being a new version of HTML with new tags and features. <strong>Nobody</strong>
understood what it really is, a simple reformulation of standard HTML 4.0 as well-formed XML.

The Mozilla project has posted their first official

This is Milestone 13, and 
is now available in binary and source form
for MacOS 8.5,

Mozilla has pretty good XML+CSS support, as well as using XML internally for a lot of configuration information.
The XML support is built on top of James Clark's expat XML parser.

Microsoft has released a beta of the next version of
their
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/downloads/webtechnology/xml/msxml.asp"> MSXML parser</a>.
This is a pre-release parser that fixes a lot of bugs in the old XML parser and adds support
for some of the XSLT 1.0 Recommendation. However it's still missing a <em>lot</em>, including
<code>xsl:transform</code>,
<code>xsl:import</code>,
<code>xsl:strip-space</code>,
<code>xsl:preserve-space</code>,
<code>xsl:apply-imports</code>,
<code>xsl:call-template</code>,
<code>xsl:namespace-alias</code> and
<code>xsl:number</code>. Furthermore, 
<code>xsl:output</code> is almost totally broken. 
<code>xsl:copy</code>
and <code>xsl:element</code> do not support the <code>use-attribute-sets</code> attribute.
<code>xsl:sort</code> does not support
the <code>lang</code>, <code>data-type</code> or <code>case-order</code> attributes.
And extension elements seem to be 
seriously non-conformant.
Furthermore the XPath support (used inside select and match attributes)
omits the  <code>following</code>, <code>following-sibling</code>, <code>preceding</code> 
and <code>preceding-sibling</code> axes. 
In short this release handles the basic templates, 
but falls apart in a lot of the trickier, 
special case scenarios. While it's an improvement over
the XSLT support built-in to IE5, it's still missing way too much to
be considered for real work.

Microsoft has also released several supporting tools
including

I've updated <a href="books/bible/updates/16.html">Chapter 16, XLinks</a>, and 
<a href="books/bible/updates/17.html">Chapter 17, XPointers</a>,
of the <cite><a href="books/bible/">XML Bible</a></cite> to reflect the latest XLink working draft.
The main change in the XLink chapter was removing all references to the 
element based syntax that was eliminated in the last draft. I also added information about 
the new semantics of
<code>xlink:show</code> and <code>xlink:actuate</code>.
The XPointer chapter didn't change very much. Mostly I just cleaned up some detritus that had 
been removed
in earlier working drafts but that I had missed in previous revisions, like the vertical bar
<code>|</code> as an alternative to <code>#</code> in URIs.

Icon Information-Systems has released the second beta 
of <a href="http://www.xmlspy.com/version30.asp">XML Spy 3.0</a>, yet another tree-based XML editor.
(My opinion of such products should be well known enough that I
won't repeat it here.)
Version 3.0 adds  editing based on the DTD, database views, 
improved file-type support, XSL transformations, and 
DTD and schema editing.
Most beta testers will not be given free copies of the shipping software.

The W3C has posted the last call working draft of 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-c14n">Canonical XML Version 1.0</a>. 
Unless major problems are found by February 22,
this will become a new standard. Canonical XML describes how to tell whether two 
documents are "the same" once excess
white space has been stripped, default attributes have been inserted, entities replaced
and so forth. 
</p>

<p>
The W3C has also released a new working draft specification for
the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xlink">XML Linking Language (XLink)</a>.  
The major change is that the xlink elements (<code>xlink:simple</code>, <code>xlink:extended</code>, 
<code>xlink:arc</code>, etc.)
have been removed. All linking is now asserted by attributes like 
<code>xlink:type</code> and <code>xlink:href</code>. 
The <code>xlink:type</code>attribute now has the added possible value <code>none</code>.
The <code>xlink:show</code> and <code>xlink:actuate</code> attributes are now 
allowed to have the value <code>undefined</code>.
In addition XLink processors are allowed to recognize other values for these attributes
to indicate application specific behavior. 
Also new are title type elements (as opposed to title attributes)
so that titles are no longer limited to one
string of text without any markup. (Actually this was in the last working draft too,
but I managed to miss it then.) Finally, external linksets 
and linkbases and the inline methods of linking to them are more clearly described.

The W3C has published a new working draft of 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-xsl-20000112">XSL Formatting Objects</a>, though apparently
it's now called simply "XSL". (That's going to be confusing and contentious.)
This is 
the first draft in quite some time. It cleans up a lot and fills in a lot of holes.
However, there's still a huge amount of work to be done.  This document is already over a megabyte
long, not including pictures.

I have updated the online versions of
<a href="books/bible/updates/16.html">Chapter 16, XLinks</a>, and 
<a href="books/bible/updates/17.html">Chapter 17, XPointers</a>
of the <cite>XML Bible</cite>  to reflect the December 1999 working drafts
of these specifications. These are major rewrites. 
</p>

<p>
The XPointer specification hasn't
changed so much from its previous working draft but I did use this opportunity
to clean up and substantially improve my presentation of the technology.
</p>

<p>
The XLink specification did change a lot from the previous working draft. 
<code>xlink:document</code> and <code>xlink:group</code> were removed. 
Local resources are now enclosed in an <code>xlink:resource</code> element. 
And out-of-line links finally make sense.
Thus the changes to Chapter 16 were quite major. 
Anyone whose working with or thinking about working with XLinks should definitely read the
new version.  
Overall I think Chapter 16 is a lot clearer than it used to be, partially
reflecting some of my editing but mostly a result of a much improved XLink
specification from the W3C that finally began 
to explain how extended and out-of-line links are meant to be used.

Lunatech Research has released beta 4 of their 
<a href="http://www.lunatech.com/products/morphon-xml-editor/">Morphon</a> XML editor.
Morphon is DTD aware with some support for XSL.
Morphon is written in Java and should run on any Java 1.1/Swing compatible platform.
This beta expires on March 31, 2000.
</p>

<p>
Morphon is perhaps a little less focused on the tree structure 
of the XML document than some of its competitors.
However, it's still way too tree focused for a typical user.
Personally, I think that almost all the XML editors out there are completely missing the boat.
Writers don't think in trees. A good XML editor (of which I know exactly zero)
would not show the tree to the author at all. 
Instead it would have a standard word-processorish
user interface with named styles that the user could modify. 
I think programmers are really wasting a lot of time, money, and effort producing one 
tree structured 
editor after another. They're modeling their user interfaces to match the underlying data
structure when in fact these should be completely decoupled. 
The user interface should reflect the tasks the user needs to accomplish, not the
underlying file format. For instance, the user doesn't give a damn about adding 
a <code>STRONG</code>  
child element to a <code>PARAGRAPH</code> element. What the user wants to do is mark a 
run of text as strongly emphasized, and the user interface should reflect that. 
Actually, even this is a stretch since it relies on semantic styles rather than visual 
formatting, but I do think that's a jump we can make. 
This is not to say the interface shouldn't be reasonably WYSIWYG. It should be. When the user
designates a block of text as strongly emphasized, it should be made bold on the screen. 
Until XML editors provide a real interface a writer can use, they offer nothing
compared to a simple text editor like BBEdit or emacs. In fact, they're a lot harder and less 
convenient to use than a simple text editor.
