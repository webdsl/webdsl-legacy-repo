Eric S. Raymond has released  <a
href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/doclifter/">doclifter 2.0</a>, an open source
 tool that transcodes {n,t,g}roff documentation to DocBook. 
 Version 2.0 adds support for man, mandoc, ms, me, and TkMan source documents as well. 
 Raymond claims the "result
is usable without further hand-hacking about 95% of the time." This
release fixes bugs.
 Doclifter is written in
Python, and requires Python 2.2a1. doclifter is published under the GPL.

The XML Apache Project has released <a
href="http://xml.apache.org/xalan-c/">Xalan-C++  1.9</a>, an open

<p> 
Michael Kay has released <a href="http://saxon.sourceforge.net/">Saxon
8.2</a>, an implementation of XSLT 2.0, XPath 2.0, and XQuery in Java. 
Saxon 8.2 is published in two versions for both of which 
Java 1.4 is required.
Saxon 8.2B is an open source product  
published under the Mozilla Public License 1.0 that 
"implements the 'basic' conformance level for XSLT 2.0 and XQuery."
Saxon <a href="http://www.saxonica.com/">8.2SA</a> is a 
Â£250.00 payware version that "allows stylesheets and queries to import an XML Schema, to validate input and output trees against a schema, and to select elements and attributes based on their schema-defined type. Saxon-SA also incorporates a free-standard XML Schema validator.
In addition Saxon-SA incorporates some advanced extensions not available in the Saxon-B product. These include a try/catch capability for catching dynamic errors, improved error diagnostics, support for higher-order functions, and additional facilities in XQuery including support for grouping, advanced regular expression analysis, and formatting of dates and numbers."
Version 8.2 adds support for XOM,
supports the JAXP 1.3 XPath and schema validation APIs,
improves performance in a few areas, 
and is more backwards compatible with XSLT 1.0 stylesheets.
Upgrades from 8.x are free.

<p>
I am pleased to announce what I expect is the final beta and release candidate of <a href="http://www.xom.nu/">XOM 1.0</a>, my open source dual streaming/tree-based API for processing XML with Java.
XOM focuses on correctness, simplicity, and performance, <em>in that order</em>. 
This final (I hope) beta makes a number of improvements to performance in various areas of the API. Depending on the nature of your programs and documents, you should see speed-ups of somewhere between 0 and 20% compared to the previous beta.
There are no over-the-covers changes in this release. Under-the-covers a few classes have undergone major rewrites, and a couple of non-public classes have been removed. All the unit tests (now over a thousand of them) still pass, but please do check this release out with your own code. If no problems are identified in this beta, I expect to officially release XOM 1.0 possibly as early as tomorrow, and certainly by the end of the year.

<p>
The W3C has released the final recommendation of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xinclude-20041220/">XInclude 1.0</a>.
There do not appear to be any significant changes since the proposed recommendation was published a couple of months ago.
Briefly, XInclude describes a means to build complex doucments out of simpler documents by replacing elements like <code>&lt;xi:include href="chapter1.xml"/></code> with the contents of the file they refer to.
For more details, I've written  a <a href="http://cafe.elharo.com/xml/xinclude/">Brief Introduction to XInclude</a>. 
</p>

<p>
There don't appear to be any fully conformant implementations yet. 
However, <a href="http://www.xom.nu/">XOM</a>'s <a href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/XOM/apidocs/nu/xom/xinclude/XIncluder.html">XIncluder class</a>  implements all the required functionality, and <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/2004/xinclude-implementation/report.html">passes all the tests</a> that don't depend on optional features. Specifically XOM does not support unparsed entities, notations, or the <code>xpointer</code> XPointer scheme. The Gnome Project's 
<a href="http://xmlsoft.org/">libxml</a> also does a pretty good job with XInclude, and does support the <code>xpointer</code> scheme, though it doesn't handle all the edge cases quite as rigorously as XOM does. I've also written <a href="http://xincluder.sourceforge.net/">XInclude engines for DOM, JDOM, and SAX</a>. However, these are much buggier and more incomplete than the XOM version. Some improvements have been made in CVS since the last milestone drop. However, they still flunk lots of the test cases, and may even get stuck in infinite loops or otherwise die horrible deaths when faced with relatively complex operations.

<img src="images/mlogo.gif" alt="" width="62" height="49" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left" />The Mozilla Project has released <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla1.7.5/">Mozilla 1.7.5</a>. This release improves IE compatibility with non-standards compliant sites,
and adds  NPRuntime support. "NPRuntime is an extension to the Netscape Plugin API that was developed in cooperation with Apple, Opera, and a group of plugin vendors." More importantly,
this release fixes over three hundred assorted bugs. Sadly none of them seem to be ones that have been bedeviling me.
This release isn't too critical, but given the large number of fixes you should probably upgrade when you get a minute. Most of these fixes will be rolled into Firefox 1.1 sometime next year.

The W3C Technical Architecture Group (TAG) has 
published <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/PR-webarch-20041105/">Architecture of the World Wide Web, First Edition</a>. Quoting from the abstract:
</p>

<blockquote>
The World Wide Web uses relatively simple technologies with sufficient scalability, efficiency and utility that they have resulted in a remarkable information space of interrelated resources, growing across languages, cultures, and media. In an effort to preserve these properties of the information space as the technologies evolve, this architecture document discusses the core design components of the Web. They are identification of resources, representation of resource state, and the protocols that support the interaction between agents and resources in the space. We relate core design components, constraints, and good practices to the principles and properties they support.
</blockquote>

<p>
It's pretty good stuff overall. Everyone working on the Web, the Semantic Web, or with XML or URIs should read it.

Rich Salz and Dave Orchard have written a proposal for a URN scheme for 
XML QNames. Basically they propose that a qualified name such as 
<code>xsl:template</code> could be written as <code>urn:qname:xsl:template:http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform</code>. The default namespace can be handled by omitting the prefix. For examle the XHTML <code>p</code> element would be <code>urn:qname::p:http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</code>. You can ignore the prefix by using an asterisk. For instance, <code>urn:qname:*:rect:http://www.w3.org/2000/svg</code> matches both <code>svg:rect</code> and <code>rect</code> in the default SVG namespace.
I've expressed a few technical and editorial quibbles with the current draft to the authors, mostly revolving around the distinctions between URI, IRI, and URI reference, 
but nothing fundamental.
 Overall this seems like a pretty solid idea. 
 I'm not sure exactly where this would be used, but it sounds like it ought to be useful somewhere.

The  W3C Multimodal Interaction working group has posted the fourth public working draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-emma-20041214/">EMMA: Extensible MultiModal Annotation markup language</a>. According to the abstract, this spec 
"provides details of an XML markup language for describing the interpretation of user input. Examples of interpretation of user input are a transcription into words of a raw signal, for instance derived from speech, pen or keystroke input, a set of attribute/value pairs describing their meaning, or a set of attribute/value pairs describing a gesture. The interpretation of the user's input is expected to be generated by signal interpretation processes, such as speech and ink recognition, semantic interpreters, and other types of processors for use by components that act on the user's inputs such as interaction managers."

Benjamin Pasero has posted the first release candidate 
of <a href="http://rssowl.sourceforge.net/">RSSOwl 1.0</a>, an open source RSS reader written in Java and based on the SWT toolkit. 
RSSOwl is the best open source RSS client I've seen written in Java. 
That said, it still doesn't feel right to me. Even ignoring various small bugs and user interface inconsistencies, news just doesn't flow in this client.  
The three-pane layout that separates the news item titles from each news item, and place the news item titles above the text of the news item doesn't work well for me.  
</p>
<hr />
<p>
The Mozilla Project has released <a href="http://sage.mozdev.org/">Sage 1.3</a>, an open source RSS plug-in for Firefox. 
Overall, I think this works better than RSSOwl. It also uses a three pane layout, but one of the panes is almost a full sized browser window, and includes complete news items, one after the other. This is almost good enough to actually use. However, it's got three major missing features:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>It does not respect the browser's font preferences. The default font is way too small for me, not is it my preferred font face for onscreen reading. </li>
<li>It does not aggregate news items from different RSS feeds. (RSSOwl does.)</li>
<li>It does not hide news items I've already read.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Both RSSOwl and Sage still feel like toys to me, not serious tools.
Neither of these products seems capable of handling hundreds of blogs and thousands of news items. Oh, don't get me wrong. I'm sure you could subscribe to hudnreds, probably thousands, of feeds in either one of them; and it wouldn't crash or slow down. But the user interface is just not adequate for managing such large, ongoing, constantly updated information collections. 
So far I'm not sure if there is an RSS client that is capable of this.
I don't know what a good RSS client will look like, but I'll know it when I see it, and so far I haven't seen it. 
RSS feeds are a new way of interacting with information, and we 
need some serious user interaction studies to understand how to properly design new user interfaces that fit. The old metaphors aren't working any more.

Ryan Tomayko has commenced work on <a href="http://splice.sourceforge.net/kid/index.html">Kid</a>, "a simple Pythonic template language for XML based vocabularies. It was spawned as a result of a kinky love triangle between XSLT, TAL, and PHP."
The language is based on just five attributes: <code>kid:repeat</code>, <code>kid:if</code>, <code>kid:content</code>, <code>kid:omit</code>, and <code>kid:replace</code>; each of which contains  a Python expression. Since this expression can point to externally defined functions, this is most of what you need. In addition there are attribute value templates similar to XSLT's, and <code>&lt;?kid?></code> processing instructions can embed code directly in the XML document.
I'm not sure I approve of the use of processing instructions in the language, but I'm not sure I don't either. Not having to escape XML-significant symbols like <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&amp;</code> in the embedded code is convenient. 
Kid templates are compiled to Python byte-code and can be imported and invoked like normal Python code.
Kid templates generate SAX events and can be used with existing libraries that work along SAX pipelines. 
Overall it looks like a fairly well-designed, well-thought out system that has clearly learned from the  mistakes of gnarly systems like PHP, JSP, and ASP. Why am I not surprised to see this coming out of the Python community?

In anticipation of the upcoming release of the XInclude recommendation,

By the way, if you're using Internet Explorer and have had problems with the comment form on the Cafes, that has now been at least partially fixed. It still looks ugly, but at least it doesn't slide under the sidebar any more. The trick was setting <code>width: 100%;</code> on the

P &amp; P Software 
has released <a href="http://xsltdoc.sourceforge.net/">XSLTdoc 1.0</a>, a free-as-in-speech (GPL) Javadoc-like tool for XSLT stylesheets. 
Instead of using comments, it uses elements in the 
http://www.pnp-software.com/XSLTdoc namespace. These are top-level elements that appear before each documented top-level XSLT element.
The processor is itself implemented in XSLT 2.0. 
The XSLT stylesheets are not complete onto themselves. A config file is also required, though mostly this just replaces what would be provided by command line arguments in javadoc. 
However, truly JavaDoc like documentation should be able to generated purely from the XSLT stylesheets themselves, without any extra files needing to be consulted.

"This document specifies the file Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)

   this document is to allow RFC 1738 to be moved to historic while
   keeping the information about the scheme on standards track."

The IETF has also posted another last call working draft of 
             <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/iri-edit/draft-duerst-iri-11.txt">Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs)</a>.
"An IRI is a sequence of characters from the
   Universal Character Set (Unicode/ISO 10646). A mapping from IRIs to
   URIs is defined, which means that IRIs can be used instead of URIs
   where appropriate to identify resources." In other words this lets you write URLs that use non-ASCII characters such as 
http://www.libÃ©ration.fr/. The non-ASCII characters would be converted to a genuine URI using hexadecimally escaped UTF-8. For instance,
http://www.libÃ©ration.fr/ becomes http://www.lib%C3%A9ration.fr/.
There's also an alternative, more complicated  syntax to be used when the DNS doesn't allow
percent escaped domain names. However, the other parts of the IRI (fragment ID, path, scheme, etc.) always use percent escaping. The changes in this draft
mostly focus on specifying different possible mechanisms for comparing IRIs for equality.

The W3C Web Services Internationalization Task Force
has published the secopnd public working draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/NOTE-ws-i18n-req-20041116/">Requirements for the Internationalization of Web Services</a>. According to the intro,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
A Web Service is a software application identified by a URI [RFC2396], whose interfaces and binding are capable of being defined, described and discovered by XML artifacts, and which supports direct interactions with other software applications using XML-based messages via Internet-based protocols. The full range of application functionality can be exposed in a Web service.
</p>

<p>
The W3C Internationalization Working Group, Web Services Task Force, was chartered to examine Web Services for internationalization issues. The result of this work is the Web Services Internationalization Usage Scenarios document [WSIUS]. Some of the scenarios in that document demonstrate that, in order to achieve worldwide usability, internationalization options must be exposed in a consistent way in the definitions, descriptions, messages, and discovery mechanisms that make up Web services.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
According to the status section, "There were only very few changes since the last publication. The main change is the addition of requirement R007  about integration with the overall Web services architecture and existing technologies. The wording of the other requirements was changed to not favor solutions that are still under discussion. Text has been streamlined and references have been updated."

It takes planning, organization, and foresight about the technology and how it will be implemented and used. The goal of this document is to help W3C editors write better specifications, by making a specification easier to interpret without ambiguity and clearer as to what is required in order to conform. It focuses on how to define and specify conformance for a specification. Additionally, it addresses how a specification might allow variation among conforming implementations.

Lately I've noticed that outlets for article sized content are becoming fewer and farther between. I've got lots of things I'd like to write about at a length somewhat longer than a typical Cafe con Leche news item, 
but much shorter than a full book; so I decided to do something about it. Hence I am announcing <a href="http://cafe.elharo.com/">The Cafes</a>, a new site for content that falls somewhere in the large territory between a blog post and a book. The initial articles include:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://cafe.elharo.com/web/welcome/">Welcome to the Cafes</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://cafe.elharo.com/xml/stax/">StAX</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://cafe.elharo.com/java/oniterators/">On Iterators and Indexes</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://cafe.elharo.com/java/arguments/">Overloading Int Considered Harmful</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
The Cafes will not be updated as regularly as Cafe con Leche; just when I've got something I want to write about. It's going to focus more on How-Tos and technical material, and less on product announcements. The goal is to write more substantive material that will be valuable for a longer period of time. I do have an <a href="http://cafe.elharo.com/feed.rss">RSS feed</a> for the site to announce the most recent articles, but my assumption is that most readers will find the site through search engines and links, when looking for information on a specific topic, not by checking in every day. 
I will be adding new articles at a rate of about one a day this week,
as I've got quite a back log to plow through. Indeed the back log was one of the 
motivating factors for launching the site. 
</p>

<p>
Also unlike Cafe au Lait/con Leche, the Cafes includes a place for reader comments on each article. 
I rolled my own comments system on top of PHP and MySQL because I really couldn't find an existing system that did what I wanted it to do. 
 At the same time, since no one's done comments like this before, I pretty much had to code the system from scratch, so it's more than likely there are some bugs flitting around, waiting to be squashed. if you happen on any of the critters, please let me know.
</p>

<p>
Judging by my server logs, a few of you have found the site already.
There's still a lot of work to be done, but I think it's ready to be opened to the public. Check it out, and let me know what you think.
Please post any comments you have on the 
<a href="http://cafe.elharo.com/web/welcome/comments.phtml">Welcome to the Cafes</a> page. 
I think you'll like what you see.
I'm very excited about <a href="http://cafe.elharo.com/">The Cafes</a>, 
and I think it's a going to be a very interesting and productive destination.
Happy XML!

This article explores one of the most powerful but little-known features of RELAX NG: the ability to define new simple data types using Java code. This enables one to check constraints like a number is prime, every left parenthesis is matched by a properly balanced right parenthesis, or the value of an SKU attribute matches the value of an SKU field in an external database. None of these constraints are expressible in the W3C XML Schema Language.

The W3C XML Protocol Working Group has published three proposed recommendations
covering XOP, a MIME multipart envelope format 
for bundling XML documents with binary data:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/PR-xop10-20041116/">XML-binary Optimized Packaging</a> "defines the XML-binary Optimized Packaging (XOP)
	convention, a means of more efficiently serializing XML Infosets (see
[XMLInfoSet]) that have certain types of content.
     
	A XOP package is created by placing a serialization of the XML Infoset
	inside of an extensible packaging format (such a MIME
	Multipart/Related, see [RFC 2387]). Then, selected
	portions of its content that are base64-encoded binary data are extracted and 
	re-encoded (i.e., the data is decoded from base64) and placed into the
	package. The locations of those selected portions are marked in the XML
	with a special element that links to the packaged data using URIs."</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/PR-soap12-mtom-20041116/">SOAP Message Transmission Optimization Mechanism</a> "describes an abstract feature and a concrete implementation of it for optimizing the transmission and/or wire format of SOAP messages. The concrete implementation relies on the [XOP] format for carrying SOAP messages." </li>
	<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/PR-soap12-rep-20041116/">Resource Representation SOAP Header Block</a> "describes the semantics and serialization of a SOAP header block for carrying resource representations in SOAP messages."</li>

</ul>

<p>
Basically this is another whack at the packaging problem: how to wrap up several
documents including both XML and non-XML documents and transmit them in a single SOAP request or response. In brief, this proposes uses a MIME envelope to do that. This is all reasonable. I do question the wisdom, however, of pretending this is just another XML document. It's not. The working group wants to ship binary data like images in their native binary form, which is sensible. What I don't like is that the working group wants to take their non-XML, MIME based format and say that it's XML because you could theoretically translate the binary data into Base-64, reshuffle the parts, and come up with something that is an XML document, even though they don't expect anyone to actually do that.
</p>

<p>
Why is there this irresistible urge throughout the technology community to call everything XML, even when it clearly isn't and clearly shouldn't be? 
XML is very good for what it is, but it doesn't and shouldn't try to be all 
things to all people. Binary data is not something XML does well and not something it ever will do well. Render into binary what is binary, and render into XML what is text.

Guidelines Working Group has posted five public working
drafts covering various topics:
</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<p>
These describe "design principles for creating accessible Web content. When these principles are ignored, individuals with disabilities may not be able to access the content at all, or they may be able to do so only with great difficulty. When these principles are employed, they also make Web content accessible to a variety of Web-enabled devices, such as phones, handheld devices, kiosks, network appliances. By making content accessible to a variety of devices, that content will also be accessible to people in a variety of situations."
</p>

<p>
There's some useful information in here. I knew most of this stuff already. but I did find a few new ideas. Frames can have titles, which I didn't know, but then I rarely if ever use frames. More practical for me is that I can put an   <code>abbr</code> attribute on <code>th</code> elements to provide terse substitutes for header labels to be used for screen readers. Also, "Use the address element to define a page's author." I'd forgotten about that one, but I'll be adding it to my pages now. And I should probably be using an <code>abbr</code> element with a <code>title</code> attribute rather than spelling out "Java Specification Request (JSR)" every time somebody submits a new draft to the <abbr title="Java Community Process">JCP</abbr>. See? I used it already!

The W3C the Voice Browser Working Group has posted a new working draft of 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-semantic-interpretation-20041108/">Semantic Interpretation for Speech Recognition</a>. According to the abstract,</p>

<blockquote> <p>
This document defines the process of Semantic Interpretation for Speech Recognition and the syntax and semantics of semantic interpretation tags that can be added to speech recognition grammars to compute information to return to an application on the basis of rules and tokens that were matched by the speech recognizer. In particular, it defines the syntax and semantics of the contents of Tags in the Speech Recognition Grammar Specification.
</p>

<p>
Semantic Interpretation may be useful in combination with other specifications, such as the Stochastic Language Models (N-Gram) Specification, but their use with N-grams has not yet been studied.
</p>

<p>
The results of semantic interpretation describe the meaning of a natural language utterance. The current specification represents this information as an ECMAScript object, and defines a mechanism to serialize the result into XML. The W3C Multimodal Interaction Activity is defining a data format (EMMA) for representing information contained in user utterances. It is believed that semantic interpretation will be able to produce results that can be included in EMMA. </p>

The W3C XML Core Working Group has posted the second and last call working draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-xml-id-20041109/">xml:id Version 1.0</a>. This describes an idea that's been kicked around in the community for some time. The basic problem is how to link to elements by IDs when a document doesn't have a DTD or schema. The proposed solution is to predefine an <code>xml:id</code> attribute that 
would alays be recognized as an ID, regardless of the presence or absence of a DTD or schema.

In my continuing efforts 
to make XML dead-bang easy to manipulate with Java,
I've posted beta 7 of <a href="http://www.xom.nu/">XOM</a>, my dual streaming/tree API for processing XML with Java. This release fixes a few bugs and approximately doubles the performance of a few common operations including 
<code>getValue()</code>, <code>toXML()</code>, DOM and SAX conversion, canonicalization, and XSL transformation. 
</p>

<p>
This is the first release candidate. There are still a few open issues with regard to error handling in XInclude that require clarification from the XInclude working group. If they decide that how XOM currently behaves is correct, then XOM 1.0 is essentially complete. If they decide to require different behavior, a few changes may yet need to be made.

Skipping right over candidate recommendation (I guess they think this has already been implemented), 
the W3C Technical Architecture Group (TAG) has posted  the 
proposed recommendation  of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/PR-webarch-20041105/">Architecture of the World Wide Web, First Edition</a>. Quoting from the abstract:
</p>

<blockquote>
The World Wide Web uses relatively simple technologies with sufficient scalability, efficiency and utility that they have resulted in a remarkable information space of interrelated resources, growing across languages, cultures, and media. In an effort to preserve these properties of the information space as the technologies evolve, this architecture document discusses the core design components of the Web. They are identification of resources, representation of resource state, and the protocols that support the interaction between agents and resources in the space. We relate core design components, constraints, and good practices to the principles and properties they support.
</blockquote>

<p>
It's pretty good stuff overall. Everyone working on the Web, the Semantic Web, or with XML or URIs should read it. Even a cursory skim reveals a few surprises. For instance, apparently URIs with fragment identifiers are now considered to be full-fledged URIs, not just URI references (When did that change?) and there's no actual syntax for fragment identifiers for URIs that point to XML documents. (What happened to XPointer?) Comments are due by December 3.

<ul>

<li>
<p>A new attribute, <code>use-when</code>, allows compile-time
conditional inclusion of sections of the stylesheet depending on the
processing environment (for example, for schema-aware or

The W3C XML Binary Characterization Working Group 
has  published  the second working draft of 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-xbc-use-cases-20041104/">XML Binary Characterization Use Cases</a>. This divides roughly 50-50 into things that should be done in plain vanilla XML (Web Services for Small Devices, Web Services as an Alternative to CORBA,  Electronic Documents, FIXML) and things that should not be done in anything remotely like XML (Floating Point Arrays in the Energy Industry, PC-free Photo Printing). 
In brief, they're trying to turn a station wagon into a Ferrari, and instead they're going to end up with an Edsel. Despite the hype XML is not, cannot, and will not be all things to all people. At best this effort will fail. At worst, it will fail and take down XML with it. 
</p>

<p>
A few of the use cases (Embedding External Data in XML Documents,  PC-free Photo Album Generation) demonstrate legitmate needs to bundle binary data with XML. However, they're doing it inside out. The XML and the binary data should be
combined in a non-XML envelope like XOM proposes, rather than forcing the binary's square pegs into XML's round holes.

Wolfgang Meier of the Darmstadt University of Technology has
posted the second beta of <a href="http://exist-db.org">eXist 1.0</a>, an
open source  native XML database that supports fulltext search.
XML can be stored in either the internal, native XML database or an
external relational database. The search engine
supports XPath and XQuery.  The server is accessible through HTTP
and XML-RPC interfaces and supports the XML:DB API for Java
programming.</p>

<p>
According to Meier, "This release benefits from a lot of testing done by other projects, and fixes many instabilities and database corruptions that were still present in the previous version. In particular, the XUpdate implementation should now have reached a stable state. Concurrent XUpdates are fully supported. The XQuery implementation has matured, adding support for collations, computed constructors, and more. Module loading has been improved, allowing more complex web interfaces to be written entirely in XQuery (see new admin interface). Finally, there's a new WebDAV module, a reindex/repair option and support for running eXist as a system service."
eXist is published under the LGPL. </p>

<p>
MetaStuff Ltd. has released <a href="http://dom4j.org/">dom4j 1.5.1</a>, 
a tree-based API for processing XML with Java. 
dom4j is based on interfaces rather than classes, which distinguishes it from alternatives like <a href="http://jdom.org/">JDOM</a> and <a href="http://www.xom.nu/">XOM</a> (Not to its credit, in my opinion. Using concrete classes instead of interfaces was one of the crucial 
decisions that made JDOM as simple as it is.) Version 1.5/1.5.1 seems to be mostly a collection of bug fixes and small, backwards compatible, API
enhancements. It improves compliance to the DOM interfaces and adds support for StAX. 
</p>

<p>
dom4j is published under a BSD license. However, it uses code form the GNU Classpath extension Project (specifically the &AElig;lfred parser) in a manner incompatible with its license, and it really should be published under the GPL as a  result. Because dom4j's own BSD license is incompatible with dom4j, any 
distribution of dom4j must violate either the copyright of MetaStuff or the copyright of the Free Software Foundation. You might be able to cure this for your own distribution by removing the org.dom4j.aelfred and org.dom4j.aelfred2 packages from your own code base, and linking to unmodified copies of GNU JAXP instead. However there might be other license mines in other parts of the code base. dom4j has a long history of ignoring other projects' licenses&mdash;it started life as an illegal fork of JDOM, though that has since been cured&mdash;and it wouldn't surprise me in the least to find more misappropriated code in other packages.

<p>
This document specifies the distribution format exchange profile (DFXP) of the timed text authoring format (TT AF) in terms of a vocabulary and semantics thereof.
</p>

<p>
The timed text authoring format is a content type that represents timed text media for the purpose of interchange among authoring systems. Timed text is textual information that is intrinsically or extrinsically associated with timing information.
</p>

<p>
The distribution format exchange profile is intended to be used for the purpose of transcoding or exchanging timed text information among legacy distribution content formats presently in use for subtitling and captioning functions.

</ul>

<p>
The XSLT 2 working draft hasn't been updated for the second time in a row now. I'm not sure what's holding it up. 
</p>

<p>
Most of the changes in XPath 2.0 in this draft seem to be editorial,  more aimed at tightening up the spec than on changing the language itself. Some of the more substantive changes include::
</p>

<ul><li>
<p>SequenceType syntax has been simplified. SchemaContextPath
is no longer part of the SequenceType syntax. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>xdt:untypedAny</code> has changed to <code>xdt:untyped</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>xs:anyType</code> is no longer abstract, and is 
used to denote the type of a partially validated element node. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Value comparisons return <code>()</code> if either operand is <code>()</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The precedence of the <code>cast</code>, <code>treat</code>, and unary arithmetic  operators has been increased.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new component has been added to the static context: context item static type.</p>
</li>
</ul>


<p>
Most of the changes in XQuery are a little more substantive and 
include::
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The last step in a path expression can  return a
sequence of atomic values or a sequence of nodes (mixed nodes and
atomic values are not allowed.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A value of type xs:QName is now defined to consist of a "triple": a
namespace prefix, a namespace URI, and a local name. Including the
prefix as part of the QName value makes it possible to cast any QName
into a string when needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Local namespace declarations have been deleted from computed element
constructors. No namespace bindings may be declared by a computed
element constructors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Prolog has been reorganized into three parts which must appear
in this order: (a) Setters; (b) Namespace declarations and module and
schema imports; (c) function and variable declarations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new "inherit-namespaces" declaration has been added to the Prolog,
and "namespace inheritance mode" has been added to the static context.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An "encoding" subclause has been added to the Version Declaration in the Prolog.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new declaration has been added to the Prolog to control the
query-wide default handling of empty sequences in ordering keys ("empty
greatest" or "empty least".) </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the static context, "current date" and "current time" have been
replaced by "current dateTime", which is defined to include a timezone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Computed comment constructors now raise an error rather than trying to "fix up" a malformed comment by inserting blanks.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>The <code>div</code> operator can now divide two yearMonthDurations or two dayTimeDurations. In either case, the result is of type <code>xs:decimal</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support for XML 1.1 and Namespaces 1.1 have been bundled together
and defined as an optional feature. Various aspects of query processing
and serialization that depend on this optional feature have been
identified.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cyclic module imports are no longer permitted. A module M may not
import another module that directly or indirectly imports module M.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The application/xquery MIME media type has been defined.</p>
</li>
</ul>

Yesterday evening I was doing some programming with DOM, when I was reminded of the importance of failing fast (as well as just how much I hate DOM). I was running the <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/Test/XInclude/">XInclude Test Suite</a> across my <a href="http://xincluder.sourceforge.net">DOMXIncluder</a> and logging the results to a simple, record-like XML document. The format for the output was suggested by the XInclude working group, but it's quite simple: no namespaces; nothing fancy. It looks like this:
</p>

<pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
&lt;testresults processor="com.elharo.xml.xinclude.DOMXIncluder">
    &lt;testresult id="imaq-include-xml-01" result="pass"/>
    &lt;testresult id="imaq-include-xml-02" result="pass"/>
    &lt;testresult id="imaq-include-xml-03" result="skipped">
        &lt;note>DOMXIncluder does not support the xpointer scheme&lt;/note>
    &lt;/testresult>
    &lt;testresult id="imaq-include-xml-04" result="pass"/>
    &lt;testresult id="imaq-include-xml-05" result="pass"/>
    &lt;testresult id="imaq-include-xml-06" result="fail"/>
...</pre>

<p>
One of the things I logged into the document was exception messages encountered when running any one of the 150 or so tests. Somewhere along the line one or more of the exception messages I logged was null or contained an XML illegal character such as a form feed. However, I'm still not sure which ones because 
DOM doesn't actually complain if you create a text node with malformed data that cannot possibly be serialized. Quite a while later, when I was serializing the document, the serializer complained and died with an unhelpful error message that didn't actually tell me where to find the problem. (I tried two serializers. Apache's XMLSerializer complained about a bad character, but didn't tell me what the character was or where it appeared. JAXP's ID transform simply generated a blank document without any error message.) As a kludgy fix, for the time being I've stopped logging the exception messages into DOM. 
</p>

<p>
The problem is not that the exception messages contained illegal characters. If I had been informed of this, it would have been trivial to work around it. The problem was that DOM didn't bother checking for this, and blindly created a malformed document. <a href="http://www.xom.nu/">XOM</a> would have caught the error immediately when it happened, rather than waiting for the entire document to be serialized. It would have pinpointed exactly where the problem was so I could fix it. Draconian error handling is a feature, not a bug. It is the API's responsibility to detect bad input. It must not rely on client programmers to provide correct data. Even when the programmers are experts who really do know all the ins and outs of which input is legal,
they may not be creating the input by hand. They are often passing in data from another source that has no idea it is talking to an API with particular preconditions. Precondition verification is a sine qua non for robust, published APIs; and it is a sine qua non that DOM fails to implement.

</p>

<ul>
	<li> Always declare the default text processing language of the page, using the html tag, unless there are more than one primary languages.</li>
	<li> Consider using a Content-Language declaration in the HTTP header or a meta tag to declare metadata about the primary language of a document.</li>
	<li> Do not use Content-Language to declare the default text processing language, and do not use language attributes to declare the primary language metadata.</li>
	<li> Do not declare the language of a document in the body tag.</li>

	<li> If you are using Content-Language to indicate the primary language metadata when there are multiple primary languages, provide a comma-separated list of all primary language tags.</li>
	<li> For documents with multiple primary languages, decide whether you want to declare a single text processing language in the html tag, or leave it undefined.</li>
	<li> For documents with multiple primary languages, try to divide the document at the highest possible level, and declare the appropriate text processing language in those blocks.</li>

	<li> Use the <code>lang</code> and/or <code>xml:lang</code> attributes around text to indicate any changes in language.</li>

	<li> For HTML use the lang attribute only, for XHTML 1.0 served as text/html use the lang and xml:lang attributes, and for XHTML served as XML use the xml:lang attribute only.</li>
	<li> Follow the guidelines in RFC3066 for language attribute values.</li>
	<li> Use the two-letter ISO 639 codes for the language code where there are both 2- and 3-letter codes.</li>
	<li> Consider using the codes zh-Hans and zh-Hant to refer to Simplified and Traditional Chinese, respectively.</li>
	<li> When pointing to a resource in another language, consider the pros and cons of using CSS to indicate the language, based on the value of the hreflang attribute of the a element.</li>
	<li> If using CSS to generate a language marker from the hreflang attribute, do not use flag icons to indicate languages.</li>

 The W3C 
 RDF Data Access Working Group has published the first public working draft of 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-rdf-sparql-query-20041012/">SPARQL Query Language for RDF</a>.
According to the introduction,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
An RDF graph is a set of triples, each consisting of a subject,
  an object, and a property relationship between them as defined in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-rdf-concepts-20040210/#section-Datatypes-intro">

  RDF Concepts and Abstract syntax</a>. These triples can come from a variety of
  sources. For instance, they may come directly from an RDF
  document. They may be inferred from other RDF triples.  They may be
  the RDF expression of data stored in other formats, such as XML or
  relational databases.</p>

  <p><acronym title="Simple Protocol And RDF Query Language">SPARQL</acronym> is a
  query language for accessing such RDF graphs. It provides
  facilities to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>extract information in the form of URIs, bNodes, plain and typed 
    literals.</li>

    <li>extract RDF subgraphs.</li>

    <li>construct new RDF graphs based on information in the queried graphs.</li>
</ul>


</blockquote>

<p>
Here's a simple example SPARQL query adapted from the draft:
</p>

<pre>PREFIX  dc: &lt;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/>
PREFIX  : &lt;http://example.org/book/>
SELECT  ?var
WHERE   ( :book1  dc:title  ?var )</pre>

<p>
The <code>?</code> indicates a variable name. This query stores the 
title of a book in a 
variable named <code>var</code>. There are boolean and numeric operators as well.

 The RDF Data Access Working Group has published the third public working draft of 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-rdf-dawg-uc-20041012/">RDF Data Access Use Cases and Requirements</a>.
According to the introduction,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The W3C's Semantic Web Activity is based on RDF's flexibility as a means of representing data. While there are several standards covering RDF itself, there has not yet been any work done to create standards for querying or accessing RDF data. There is no formal, publicly standardized language for querying RDF information. Likewise, there is no formal, publicly standardized data access protocol for interacting with remote or local RDF storage servers.
</p>

<p>
Despite the lack of standards, developers in commercial and in open source projects have created many query languages for RDF data. But these languages lack both a common syntax and a common semantics. In fact, the extant query languages cover a significant semantic range: from declarative, SQL-like languages, to path languages, to rule or production-like systems. The existing languages also exhibit a range of extensibility features and built-in capabilities, including inferencing and distributed query.
</p>

<p>
Further, there may be as many different methods of accessing remote RDF storage servers as there are distinct RDF storage server projects. Even where the basic access protocol is standardized in some senseâHTTP, SOAP, or XML-RPCâthere is little common ground upon which to develop generic client support to access a wide variety of such servers.
</p>

<p>
The following use cases characterize some of the most important and most common motivations behind the development of existing RDF query languages and access protocols. The use cases, in turn, inform decisions about requirements, that is, the critical features that a standard RDF query language and data access protocol require, as well as design objectives that aren't on the critical path.

	href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-ws-cdl-10-20041012/">Web Services Choreography Description Language Version 1.0</a>. According to the
	abstract, 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The Web Services Choreography Description Language (WS-CDL) is an XML-based language that describes peer-to-peer collaborations of parties by defining, from a global viewpoint, their common and complementary observable behavior; where ordered message exchanges result in accomplishing a common business goal.
</p>

<p>
The Web Services specifications offer a communication bridge between the heterogeneous computational environments used to develop and host applications. The future of E-Business applications requires the ability to perform long-lived, peer-to-peer collaborations between the participating services, within or across the trusted domains of an organization.
</p>

<p>
The Web Services Choreography specification is targeted for composing interoperable, peer-to-peer collaborations between any type of party regardless of the supporting platform or programming model used by the implementation of the hosting environment.

    <p>
    OK. I snuck that last point in myself. It seems only slightly less likely than
    satisfying all the rest of these goals in a single format. I am glad the working group is so ambitious. Hopefully they'll either fail, and let the rest of us go back to doing real work with plain vanilla XML, or they'll succeed and produce something quite useful. However, I do hope they won't accept half measures. Some of these goals have not been important to vendors in this space before, human readability perhaps foremost among them. The group does use 
a very unorthodox definition of human readable though. 
Human deducible is more accurate; i.e. the format needs to be able to be reverse engineered without access to the specification or documentation.
The requirement to be self contained rules out a lot of schema based compression systems. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    There's one important non-goal that's notable by its absence. There's no requirement here that the format be language neutral. Actually that's two requirements: one that it not prefer one programming language over another and one that it not prefer one human language over another. A lot of the proposals I've seen have been designed so that they ran very fast in one particular environment but slowed down noticeably in environments with different byte orders, primitive data type widths, and other memory layout characteristics. Binary formats by their nature tend to be very tied to one particular architecture to the detriment of others. Java byte code, for instance, happens to look a lot like what a Sparc engineer would expect to see, and that meant 
Java was less than optimal on X86 systems even though it was nominally platform independent. XSLT 1.0 is very hard to implement outside of java (and these days, even inside Java) because it normatively references the Java 1.1 specification.
XSLT 1.1 died due to infighting between the Python and Java communities. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Even more seriously the specification should not favor some natural languages over others. For instance, it would be unacceptable to design a format where English ASCII data was highly compressed but Chinese data wasn't.
UTF-8 has this issue, but Unicode and XML don't because they allow individuals documents to choose their own encodings. Each document can be optimized for tis own needs. Typical data-neutral compression schemes like basic Huffman coding have this property naturally. However, some of the schemes for XML compression I've seen make a lot of assumptions about what the data looks like, and optimize for particular scenarios at the expense of others. At least when it comes to text, we need to make sure that English and Chinese are both supported well
(as should be the 6,000 or so other languages on the planet too, of course).

I was just getting ready to upgrade to Apache httpd 2.0.52 when I noticed an apparent security issue on their web server. This won't allow anybody to crack into www.apache.org, so let me just describe it here, and see what people think. I wanted to check the PGP signature of the file I downloaded from a mirror, so I grabbed the signature from Apache's web site at <a href="http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/httpd-2.0.52.tar.gz.asc">http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/httpd-2.0.52.tar.gz.asc</a>. Notice anything funny about that URL? The scheme is http, not https. That means the connection is unauthenticated, which means it's vulnerable to a man in the middle attack. Shouldn't these signatures only be served over an authenticated connection? 
Am I out to sea, or is this a real problem? <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;elharo%40metalab%2Eunc%2Eedu?Subject=Apache%20Signature">Let me know what you think</a>. Before commenting, please take note of two things:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>The encryption or lack thereof doesn't matter here. It's authentication I care about. </li>
	<li>I'm not really interested in hearing how unlikely man-in-the-middle attacks are. Many, many people and organizations depend on Apache HTTPD; and some of them do need to defend against attacks from governments that can subvert the ISPs. </li>
</ol>

<p>
Possibly the verification of the KEYS file from the root certificates might cover this. But if that's the case, then why are we warned to 
"Make sure you get these files from the main distribution directory, rather than from a mirror." If we really do need to get them from the main site, and not some other site, then we really do need to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, when I tried to verify the file, a problem showed up:
</p>

<pre><samp>gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
gpg: Fingerprint: 33 16 9B 46 FC 12 D4 01  CA 6D DB D7 DE EA 4F D7</samp></pre>

This looks like a classic case of good algorithms compromised by bad protocol implementation. This is exactly how codes are broken and security subverted in the real world.

The IETF has posted another last call working draft of

http://www.libÃ©ration.fr/. The non-ASCII characters would be converted to a genuine URI using hexadecimally escaped UTF-8. For instance,
http://www.libÃ©ration.fr/ becomes http://www.lib%C3%A9ration.fr/.
There's also an alternative, more complicated  syntax to be used when the DNS doesn't allow
percent escaped domain names. However, the other parts of the IRI (fragment ID, path, scheme, etc.) always use percent escaping. The changes in this draft appear to be editorial in nature.

freeware TrueType font
 covering some of the scripts
in the new Plane 1, including Deseret, Old Italic, Gothic, Aegean Numbers, Cypriot Syllabary, Pollard Script, and Ugaritic. It also provides experiemntal support for Old Persian Cuneiform, Tengwar, and Cirth, though the code pointm here will change in the future.  According to Kass,
 "Code2001 works on Windows 2000, but may not work on other operating systems. Mac OS X supports Unicode's higher planes and Code2001 will work with certain applications." This release adds "rough glyphs for many of the scripts which were added in Unicode 4.0 are now found in the font. These rough, filler glyphs were added quickly in order to enable testing of these additions. These rough glyphs will be improved for the next release, meanwhile they should be better than those little squares."

Michael Kay has released <a href="http://saxon.sourceforge.net/">Saxon
8.1.1</a>, an implementation of XSLT 2.0, XPath 2.0, and XQuery in Java. 
Saxon 8.1 is published in two versions for both of which 
Java 1.4 is required.
Saxon 8.1B is an open source product  
published under the Mozilla Public License 1.0 that 
"implements the 'basic' conformance level for XSLT 2.0 and XQuery."
Saxon <a href="http://www.saxonica.com/">8.1SA</a> is a 
Â£250.00 payware version that "allows stylesheets and queries to import an XML Schema, to validate input and output trees against a schema, and to select elements and attributes based on their schema-defined type. Saxon-SA also incorporates a free-standard XML Schema validator.
In addition Saxon-SA incorporates some advanced extensions not available in the Saxon-B product. These include a try/catch capability for catching dynamic errors, improved error diagnostics, support for higher-order functions, and additional facilities in XQuery including support for grouping, advanced regular expression analysis, and formatting of dates and numbers."
Version 8.1.1 is a bug fix release.
Upgrades from 8.x are free.

In my continuing efforts 
to make XML a lot less irritating for in-memory manipulation,
I've posted beta 6 of <a href="http://cafeconleche.org/XOM/">XOM</a>, my dual streaming/tree API for processing XML with Java.
This beta is primarily a bug fix release. It also polishes off some rough edges in various corners of the API. Changes in this release include:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><p> The deprecated <code>setNodeFactory()</code> method in <code>XSLTransform</code>  has been removed. This is the only API-level change in this release. </p></li>

	<li><p> The strings returned by <code>toString</code> in <code>Comment</code>, <code>ProcessingInstruction</code>, <code>Attribute</code>, and <code>Text</code>
are all now truncated if they get too long. Furthermore any embedded
line breaks and tabs are escaped as \n, \r, and \t. This makes the
objects easier to inspect in various debuggers and loggers. </p></li>

	<li><p> <code>SAXConverter</code> no longer converts XOM <code>xml:base</code> attributes into SAX attributes. Instead the <code>xml:base</code> attributes are used to determine the URI information the <code>Locator</code> reports. Providing <code>xml:base</code> attributes as well would risk double counting some relative URLs. </p></li>

</ul>

<p>
Windows users may have a little trouble with the zip archive, because it contains some files used to test the conversion of file names to URIs 
when the file names have illegal characters such as angle brackets that 
Windows doesn't like. You may, therefore, see some error messages while unzipping. Ignore them. The only practical effect this has is that  seven 
of the 964 unit tests will fail on Windows. This will be fixed in the next release. All platforms may also have trouble with a file named resumÃ©.xml, included to test the conversion of file names with non-ASCII characters to 
base URLs. In this case, all modern platforms should be able to handle the file. However, the Ant zip and tar tasks are mangling the Ã© character when they add the file to the archive. Either the CVS repository on java.net or the Eclipse CVS client has a similar problem.  
Regardless, the functionality of the core API is not affected, and XOM does work well with files whose names contain unusual characters, as these test cases were written to prove. I just can't seem to get them into the distro. <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;elharo%40metalab%2Eunc%2Eedu?Unicode%20file%20names">Suggestions</a> for fixing this are appreciated.

So far everyone seems happy with the new layout, but I noticed one more problem. 
The top navbar (i.e. the list of links to other pages) still appears before the content of the page. This is a violation of web accessibility guidelines. 
The content should be the very first element on the page for maximum accesibility for anyone using a screen reader. Having to listen to 14 links before reaching the quote of the day isn't as bad as listening to the entire side bar droned out, but it's still annoying as hell.
I suspect I'm going to have to absolutely postiion the header div at the top of the page. That's probably going to muck with the rest of the layout. 
As usual I'll post test pages for everyone to look at before doing anything too drastic. Expect more CSS shenanigans soon.

	Language</a>. According to the abstract, </p>

	<blockquote> The Ink Markup Language serves as the data format for representing ink entered with an electronic pen or stylus. The markup allows for the input and processing of handwriting, gestures, sketches, music and other notational languages in Web-based (and non Web-based) applications. It provides a common format for the exchange of ink data between components such as handwriting and gesture recognizers, signature verifiers, and other ink-aware modules.

  <p>
  	That's more verbose, but it's also much clearer. It would let
	  the data be extracted with standard XML tools rather than
	  requiring each user to write their own micro-parser for the
	  <code>trace</code> elements. If InkML really can't afford to
	  actually markup the x and y coordinates as x and y
	  coordinates instead of raw text, then one wonders why it's
	  using XML at all?
</p>

<p>
This draft adds a <code>metadata</code> element, defines the application/inkml+xml  MIME media type, 
adds a <code>documentID</code> attribute, and includes more tutorial material. However, the fundamental problems with the proposed

The new layout seems to be causing problem for readers with particularly long and difficult to spell last names (well probably not, but the first people to report the problem were Larry Zappaterrini and Richard Duivenvoorde). It seems to be caused by a small font size. For the moment, if you're not seeing everything, try increasing the text size a few points. The stylesheet does not set any absolute font sizes, just uses whatever default you've picked.
</p>

<p>
OK. I have a partial fix. It should be OK for any readable font size, though you can still reproduce it if you shrink the font to something illegible. 
The problem is that the width of the navbar is specified in ems and the min-width is specified in pixels. I need to do this to make sure the navbar is wide enough for both the text and the images. However, the right margin of the content area is given in ems, which works as long as the distinction between ems and pixels doesn't get too far out of whack from what it usually is.
The hack is to specify roughly half the margin I want in ems and put the other half in pixels in padding. This isn't a perfect solution. CSS desperately needs a way to place an element at an offset from another element, rather than at a fixed position on the page.</p>

<p>
Another big missing feature is the ability to specify min and max margins and paddings. The problem here happens because I need to set the contents right margin to at least the width of the navigation bar on the right. Sometimes that margin is set by the width property and sometimes its set by the min-width property. Which is bigger depends on the font size.
I have no way to specify that the right margin of the contents is the maximum of the navbar's width and min-width. I have to set the margin to one or the other. :-(

There didn't seem to be any major issues with the last iteration of the CSS layout for this page, so I've switched the main page over. If no one notices any problems with this, I'll probably switch Cafe au Lait in a week or two.

<p>
A lot of people kept getting hung up on the <code>pre</code> element in <a href="#news2004September24">September 24</a> that extends past the width of the
window if the window isn't grossly large. I can't quite find it in myself to call this a bug though. It's an unusual but legal and important use of the  <code>pre</code> element. In the particular example at hand, it was critical to reproduce the white space exactly, long though it was. In essence this was  an unintentional stress test that demonstrated how different layout algorithms coped with an impossible situation. The three major different layouts (table, absolute positioning, and float-based) all handled this differently. 
The table layout expanded the content area to be wide enough to hold the content and added scroll bars if necessary. The absolutely positioned layout 
runs the extra text under the righthand navbar, but doesn't change the size of the rest of the content area. The float layout overlaid the overly wide text on top of the navbar, but also didn't change the size of the content area.  Readers who noted the problem were roughly equally divided as to which solution they 
preferred. There was no clear consensus that one was right and one was wrong.
Personally, I think the smartest solution was overlaying the wide content
like the float-based layout did. It's also possible the content area shoudl have received horizontal scroll bars of its own (something none of the layouts did).
Possibly I can hack this behavior in with additional CSS properties. I'll explore that soon, but this is an unusual situation and not worth 
holding up the major changes for. It's a complete fluke that one of the rare news items I postetd with over-wide content happened to fall within the week where I was exploring CSS layouts. Most weeks this won't be an issue, and any other week no one would have noticed the problem. 
</p>

<p>
One issue a couple of people raised was whether I should set a maximum width on the content area. This is based on the general prinicple that long lines 
are harder to read. I explored that option but decided against it. 
Practically, if I set a maximum width on the content area, I couldn't make the navbar flush left up against the content instead of leaving big ugly patches of white space in the middle of the page.  More importantly, the more I thought about it, the more it seemed to me that this principle was just plain wrong for the Web. Unlike a newspaper, a web browser allows users to set the width of the window to fit their needs, rather than those of the publisher. If the lines are too long, it's easy to make the window smaller. While there may be a nice sweet spot for line length that mostly satisfies most users most of the time, it's not going to fit everyone. In particular, I suspect it may not fit readers with very babd eyesight who like to bump up their font sizes very high. Therefore I think it's much more important to give users the option to make the lines narrower or wider than it is to set a maximum width. 
I'm still open on this one though, if anyone can make a really strong argument for maximum line layout that takes into account the difference between screen based layout and print, and considers the needs of visually impaired but not completely blind users. However, so far all I've seen on this point 
seems to be based on old rules for working in print, repurposed for 
the web world without a great consideration for the very real differences between onscreen display and paper.

Note to <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=b7fd2aa7-8b34-4ab2-823b-410737ded6e5">Dare</a> (posted here because your comments are broken): 
The basic rule I had for creating an RSS feed for this site was that it couldn't require me to do more work than I was doing already, at least not on an ongoing basis.
That's why I use XSLT driven by a cron job to generate the feed. 
I can edit the same way I always have, and the RSS happens automatically.
The tools adjust to fit me rather than me adjusting to fit the tools. 
Adding individual URLs for each story would require bending myself around the tools, and I have this silly idea that computers were meant to serve people rather than the other way around. 
Actually the solution for the problem you note is to use XPointers to 
identify the individual news items. It would be easy enough to generate them automatically using XSLT. I haven't actually tried that. Maybe it would work, but I sort of expect it might run into some problems with browser compatibility. 
</p>

<p>
The initial stumbling block that kept me from adding an RSS feed to this site
was that
my news items don't have titles, but then it occurred to me that I could use the first sentence of each item as the title. 
Of course this broke some RSS software written by developers who hadn't actually paid much attention to the specs because sometimes my sentences are on the long side and tend to  drone on and on and on, but you get the idea and anyway this should be handled by clients because of course developers don't write arbitrary limitations on string size into their code because sooner or later those assumptions are going to be violated, as they were for some web browser's layout algorithms a couple of day's ago when I posted a <code>pre</code> fragment that couldn't fit within a browser window although in that case it was really important for semantic reasons to reproduce the exact line breaks and anyway how's that for a run-on sentence&mdash;once in high school I wrote an entire 500 word theme as a single run-on sentence. 
</p>

<p>
Anyway, back to the point. I'm not going to rearrange my site to fit the needs of broken news readers. RSS got a lot of things wrong, and one of those things may be the lack of any unique identifier for articles separate from titles and URLs. However, that doesn't mean a client is justified in assuming that other things in the feed are in fact unique identifiers. If an RSS 0.92 client really
 needs to figure out whether two items are the same or different, it needs to use a combination of heuristics rather than relying on some assumed uniqueness that isn't actually present. Most simply, it could retrieve both items, and see if the old one is still there or not. It could also compare the descriptions, URLs, and titles and do a fuzzy match, without assuming that a change in a single byte reflected a completely new item.  And if it can't do that, 
then it needs to be designed to operate correctly without any information about which items are new and which aren't. None of this is rocket science. It simply requires implementing the spec as it is, rather than as we might wish to be.

Ian E. Gorman has released  <a href="http://gxparse.sourceforge.net/">GXParse 1.5</a>, a free (LGPL) Java library that sits on top of a SAX parser and provides semi-random access to the XML document. The documentation isn't very clear, but as near as I can tell, it buffers various constructs like elements until their end is seen, rather than dumping pieces on you immediately like SAX does. This release completes namespace support, eases
exception handling, and adds a few operators  to CurrentElement.

<p>
One more time. I've got a new <a href="test3.html">CSS laid out version of this page</a> to check out. This one returns to absolute positioning instead of floats. However, it uses relative measurements in ems and exs instead of absolute pixel counts. This makes it more flexible in the face of changing font sizes. This pretty much seems to work across all the browsers I tried including Firefox, Safari, Mozilla, Internet Explorer 5 for Mac OS 9, Internet Explorer 5.5 for Mac OS X, and Netscape 4.7 for Mac OS 9. I haven't tested IE for Windows yet.
As usual, please check it out

</p>


<p>
It does seem apparent to me that CSS is missing some crucial features 
needed for truly dynamic, flexible layouts. The most important 
is that there's no way to set the width, height, or position of one element to be a function of the width, height, or position of another element. All I'm really trying to do here is say that the navbar on the right starts about 1.2 times the height of the header below the header, regardless of font size, window size, and the number of characters in the header. For example,
</p>

<p><code>top: 1.2*height(#header)</code></p>

<p>or perhaps</p>

<p><code>top: bottom(#header) + 20px</code></p>

Yesterday's <a href="index2.html">experimental version 
of this page using CSS instead of table layouts</a> proved insufficiently liquid in the face of font size changes. That seems to be a flaw of any layout involving absolute positioning. I've written a <a href="index3.html">different layout</a> that uses 
floats instead. Again, please check it out
and <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;elharo%40metalab%2Eunc%2Eedu?Subject=CSS%20version">let me know</a> if anything looks too funky to live with. If so, please let me know what browser on what platform you're using. It seems to work well on all the browsers I have conveniently available, but I haven't tested IE5 for Windows yet.
</p>

<p>
This page looks better, but it's got one major flaw compared to yesterday's. In order to float the navbar on the right I had to move the <code>div</code> containing the 
navbar to the beginning of the HTML before the content. This is a major hassle for anyone using a non-CSS browser, Lynx, or a screen reader. I really need to move the navigation after the main content. Any suggestions? 
</p>

<p>
Several people commented on the overly long <code>pre</code> element.
That's a coincidence but it is a good test. What does/should a browser do with a <code>pre</code> element that's too wide for a page or a window or a panel? 
</p>

<p>
A couple of people viewed source, and noted it wasn't valid XHTML.
That's correct, and that's a deliberate decision. The page is well-formed, which is all XML processors need; and the additional markup I've added for my own use 
follows the longstanding principle that browsers should ignore any tags they don't recognize. Validity is overemphasized in XHTML. At one point, I did use modular XHTML to make this page valid. I even wrote about that in Chapter 7 of <cite><a href="books/xian3/">XML in a Nutshell</a></cite>. However, that broke far too many existing web browsers for me to seriously consider putting it into production. It's important that elements be used in the ways the spec intends them to be used. 
It's not important that there be no other elements about which the spec says nothing.

Do me a favor. Please take a look at the <a href="index2.html">experimental version

If so, please let me know what browser on what platform you're using. It seems to work well on all the browsers I have conveniently available, but I haven't tested IE5 for Windows yet.
Netscape 4 isn't great, but I was able to hack that enough so it isn't unreadable. One thing I still haven't figured out how to do is center the 
<code>h1</code> header ("Cafe con Leche XML News and Resources") within the left hand panel.
I can center it relative to the page, but that's not quite the same thing, especially in a wide window.

</p>
<hr />
<p>
I've been spending a lot of time reviewing RSS readers lately, and overall they're a pretty poor lot. Latest example. Yesterday's Cafe con Leche feed contained this completely legal <code>title</code> element:
</p>

<pre><code>&lt;title>I'm very pleased to announce the publication of XML in a Nutshell, 3rd edition by myself and W.
          Scott Means, soon to be arriving at a fine bookseller near you.
          &lt;/title></code></pre>

<p>
Note the line break in the middle of the <code>title</code> content.
This confused at least two RSS readers even though there's nothing wrong with it
according to the <a href="http://backend.userland.com/rss092">RSS 0.92 spec</a>.
Other features from my RSS feeds  that have caused problems in the past include long titles, a single URL that points to several stories, and not including more than one day's worth of news in a feed. 
</p>

<p>
Cafe con Leche and Cafe au Lait use XSLT to generate their RSS feeds, so they're always completely well-formed. The home pages are edited by hand, and may not always be well-formed; but if so the XSLT processor reports an error and does not generate a new RSS document. I really wish RSS vendors would focus on implementing the actual specs reasonably before they wasted time on supporting brain damage like malformed feeds and double escaped HTML. It's well-known that 
supporting non-conformant documents poisons the well for everyone. What's less well-known is that adding support for non-conformant documents tends to break the support for sites that actually follow the specifications. Everyone gets sucked into a race to the bottom, and we end up back in the world
where everyone's browser handles sites just a little bit differently from everyone else's, and vendors compete based on how many broken sites they can make sense out of instead of how well they can present genuinely good data.
This is the HTML hell  XML was supposed to save us from. Those who forget the past are condemned to repeat it.

I'm very pleased to announce the publication of <a href="books/xian3/">XML in a Nutshell, 3rd edition</a> by myself and W. Scott Means,
soon to be arriving at a <a href="http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/biblio?inkey=62-0596007647-0">fine</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN%3D0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref%3Dnosim">bookseller</a> <a href="http://shop.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0596007647">near you</a>. <cite>XML in a Nutshell</cite> is quite simply the most complete and succinct treatment of the major technologies in XML you'll find anywhere.
Topics covered include elements, attributes, syntax, namespaces, well-formedness, DTDs, schemas, XPath, XSLT, <acronym title="XSL Formatting Objects">XSL-FO</acronym>, CSS, SAX, DOM, internationalization, XHTML, and more.
The third edition is a major update that syncs the book with the latest developments in XML including:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>XML 1.1</li>
	<li>XInclude</li>
	<li>DOM Level 3</li>
	<li>SAX 2.0.1</li>
	<li>Unicode 4.0.1</li>
	<li>XPointer 1.0</li>
	<li>Namespaces 1.1</li>
</ul>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
If you don't have a copy, you need a copy. 
Do you need to upgrade your old copy?  If you're sticking to XML 1.0 (a recommendation I've made in my  two previous books and continue to stand by in this one), the second edition will probably continue to serve you well. However, if you're still thumbing through a very dog-eared copy of the first edition, it's definitely time to upgrade. XML hasn't stood still in the three years since the first edition was published, and there's a lot of new and improved material here. 
</p>

<p>
My author's copy arrived a couple of days ago, and generally it ships to me from the warehouse at the same time it ships to bookstores, just by slightly faster courier, so bookstores should have it in stock any day now. 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN%3D0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref%3Dnosim">Amazon</a> is still listing it at the full cover price of $39.95, but they normally drop that as soon as it gets in stock, so you may want to wait a day or two to order it. Update: Sometime today they dropped the price to $27.17, a 32% savings, plus they'r eoffering free supersaver shipping. They normally don't do this until they have the book in stock, so I expect it to arrive any day now. Go ahead and order it.  
<a href="http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/biblio?inkey=62-0596007647-0">Powell's</a>, <a href="http://shop.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0596007647">Barnes &amp; Noble</a>, and other 
bookstores should have it momentarily as well. It will also be available on <a href="http://safari.oreilly.com/">Safari</a> in the not too distant future for those readers who prefer their books in electronic format. The book is <cite>XML in a  Nutshell, 3rd edition</cite>. The ISBN is 0-596-00292-0. It's published by O'Reilly, and written by W. Scott Mean and me, Elliotte Rusty Harold. Check it out!

The concrete implementation relies on the [XOP] format for carrying SOAP messages." </li>

</ul>

<p>
Basically this is another whack at the packaging problem: how to wrap up several
documents including both XML and non-XML documents and transmit them in a single SOAP request or response. In brief, this proposes uses a MIME envelope to do that. This is all reasonable. I do question the wisdom, however, of pretending this is just another XML document. It's not. The working group wants to ship binary data like images in their native binary form, which is sensible. What I don't like is that the working group wants to take their non-XML, MIME based format and say that it's XML because you could theoretically translate the binary data into Base-64, reshuffle the parts, and come up with something that is an XML document, even though they don't expect anyone to actually do that.
</p>

<p>
Why is their this insane urge across the technological spectrum to call everything XML, even when it clearly isn't and clearly shouldn't be? 
XML is very good for what it is, but it doesn't and shouldn't try to be all 
things to all people. Binary data is not something XML does well and not something it ever will do well. Render into binary what is binary, and render into XML what is text.

Now that I'm moving my primary machine to Mac OS X, I've decided to finally break down and get an RSS reader. A lot of people like the payware NetNewsWire
or the free-beer NetNewsWire Lite, but I'm going to try <a href="http://rssowl.sourceforge.net/">RSSOwl</a> first instead. It's open source and written in Java, so I figure I should be able to fix it so it works the way I want if necessary. Of course if it requires too much fixing that decision may change fast. Hmm, it doesn't open pages in my browser so I'm forced to use a third of a screen in RSSOwl to read an entire article, and there's no AppleScript support. This may change faster than I thought. 
Hmm, OK. Maybe not. It can use an external browser, but you have to configure that in the preferences first, which are not in the right place. (I filed a bug on this.) Hmm, and even after you do that it picks the wrong browser (Safari instead of Mozilla) but at least it uses an external browser.
OK, looks like Net Newswire has the same bug, but NetNewswire has a <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/faq.php#ie">FAQ</a> that explains how to work around the bug. Wouldn't you know it? That fixes the bug in RSSOwl too.

I've posted the fourth beta of <a href="http://cafeconleche.org/XOM/">XOM</a>, my absolutely correct, open source, dual tree-streaming API for procesing XML with Java.
This release is still backwards compatible with 1.0d25. However it does 
deprecate four <code>XSLTransform</code> constructors that
will be removed in the next release. The upside is that XSLT 
transformation should now be much faster and mmore 
memory efficient since XOM 
is no longer writing documents out into strings and passing those to the 
transform. Instead it is streaming SAX events directly into the 
transformer. Furthermore, implementing this exposed several bugs in the 
<code>SAXConverter</code> (and indirectly one in the <code>DOMConverter</code>) that have now been 
fixed. I've also fixed some minor cosmetic bugs innvolving serialization 
of internal DTD subsets.
</p>

<p>
I've also completed the first draft of the <a href="http://cafeconleche.org/XOM/tutorial.xhtml">XOM tutorial</a> (XHTML compliant browser required). 
At this point I'm open for any comments anyone has, ranging from

The W3C has posted the <a href="http://www2005.org/papers/cfp.html">call for papers</a> for
<a href="http://www2005.org/">WWW2005</a>, to be held in Chiba, Japan,
 May 10-14, 2005. Papers are due by 
November 8 and "will be peer-reviewed by at least 3 reviewers from an
International Program Committee. Accepted papers will appear in the
conference proceedings published by the Association for Computing
Machinery (ACM), and will also be accessible to the general public via
http://www2005.org/." Tutorial proposals are due by October 15, and tutorials may be given in either English or Japanese.
The latter's a nice touch. I'm always amazed by conferences in 
non-English speaking countries 
where even the locals deliver in English. 
</p>

<p>
Chiba's a great choice for a conference like this, but I'm afraid I'll have to pass on this one. It's too far, too expensive, and too unpaid for me to justify the trip.
My bank account is already showing the effect of attending too many academic conferences this year, and I've had to decline several interesting shows already because they expect the speakers to subsidize them rather than the other way around. 
That said, if anyone has a budget to pay speakers and is interested in 
hearing me present on XOM, Effective XML, XQuery, or many other XML related subjects, to either a conference or your company, please do <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;elharo%40metalab%2Eunc%2Eedu?Subject=Conference%20Invite">drop me a line</a>.

and I do quite a bit of that here in New York&mdash;I'll be talking to the XML User's Group in Albany in October; topic and location will be announced soon&mdash;but anything that requires long distance travel needs to be compensated to justify the time away from other projects.

W3C's Working Groups, with particular focus on testability and test topics.
It is intended for Working Group chairs and team contacts. It aims to help
them to avoid known pitfalls and benefit from experiences gathered from the
W3C Working Groups themselves. It provides techniques, tools, and templates
that should facilitate and accelerate their work. This document is one of the

It takes more than knowledge of the technology to make a specification precise, implementable and testable. It takes planning, organization, and foresight about the technology and how it will be implemented and used. The goal of this document is to help W3C editors write better specifications, by making a specification easier to interpret without ambiguity and clearer as to what is required in order to conform. It focuses on how to define and specify conformance for a specification. Additionally, it addresses how a specification might allow variation among conforming implementations. The document is presented as a set of guidelines or principles, supplemented with good practices, examples, and techniques."

"provides details of an XML markup language for describing the interpretation of user input. Examples of interpretation of user input are a transcription into words of a raw signal, for instance derived from speech, pen or keystroke input, a set of attribute/value pairs describing their meaning, or a set of attribute/value pairs describing a gesture. The interpretation of the user's input is expected to be generated by signal interpretation processes, such as speech and ink recognition, semantic interpreters, and other types of processors for use by components that act on the user's inputs such as interaction managers."

The W3C SVG Working Group has published the first public working draft <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-sXBL-20040901/">SVG's XML Binding Language (sXBL)</a>. 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
 sXBL is a mechanism for defining the presentation and interactive behavior of elements described in a namespace other than SVG's.
</p>

<p>
sXBL is intended to be used to enable XML vocabularies (tag sets) to be implemented in terms of SVG elements. For instance, a tag set describing a flowchart could be mapped to low-level SVG path and text elements, possibly including interactivity and animation.
</p>

<p>
sXBL is intended to be an SVG-specific first version of a more general-purpose XBL specification (e.g., "XBL 2.0"). The intent is that, in the future, a general-purpose and modularly-defined XBL specification will be developed which will replace this specification and will define additional features that are necessary to support scenarios beyond SVG, such as integration into web browsers that support CSS. Once a general-purpose XBL is defined, sXBL would just become an SVG-specific subset (i.e., a profile) of the larger XBL specification.

This was formerly developed as the the Rendering Custom Content feature in SVG 1.2, but has now been split off into its own spec.

 The RDF Data Access Working Group has published the second public working draft of 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-rdf-dawg-uc-20040802/">RDF Data Access Use Cases and Requirements</a>.
According to the introduction,
</p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>The W3C's Semantic Web Activity is based on RDF's flexibility as a means
  of representing data. While there are several standards covering RDF
  itself, there has not yet been any work done to create standards for
  querying or accessing RDF data. There is no formal, publicly standardized
  language for querying RDF information. Likewise, there is no formal,
  publicly standardized data access protocol for interacting with remote or
  local RDF storage servers.</p>

  <p>Despite the lack of standards, developers in commercial and in open
  source projects have created <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/11/13-RDF-Query-Rules/">many query languages for
  RDF data</a>. But these languages lack both a common syntax and a common
  semantics. In fact, the extant query languages cover a significant semantic
  range: from declarative, SQL-like languages, to path languages, to rule or
  production-like systems. The existing languages also exhibit a range of
  extensibility features and built-in capabilities, including inferencing and
  distributed query.</p>

  <p>Further, there may be as many different methods of accessing remote RDF
  storage servers as there are distinct RDF storage server projects. Even
  where the basic access protocol is standardized in some senseâHTTP, SOAP,
  or XML-RPCâthere is little common ground upon which to develop generic
  client support to access a wide variety of such servers.</p>

  <p>The following use cases characterize some of the most important and most
  common motivations behind the development of existing RDF query languages
  and access protocols. The use cases, in turn, inform decisions about
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-rdf-dawg-uc-20040802/#req">requirements</a>, that is, the critical features that a
  standard RDF query language and data access protocol require, as well as
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-rdf-dawg-uc-20040802/#dobj">design objectives</a> that aren't on the critical path.</p>

The W3C Technical Architecture Group (TAG) has posted  the 
first last call working draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-webarch-20040816/">Architecture of the World Wide Web, First Edition</a>. Quoting from the abstract:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The World Wide Web is an information space of interrelated resources.
This information space is the
basis of, and is shared by, a number of information systems. Within
each of these systems, people and software retrieve, create,
display, analyze, relate, and reason about resources.</p>

<p>Web architecture defines the information space in terms of
identification of resources, representation of resource state, and
the protocols that support the interaction between agents and resources
in the space.
Web architecture is
influenced by social requirements and software engineering 
<strong>principles</strong>. These lead to design choices
and <strong>constraints</strong> on
the behavior of systems that use
the Web in order to achieve desired properties of the shared
information space: efficiency, scalability, and the potential for
indefinite growth across languages, cultures, and media. <strong>Good
practice</strong> by agents in the system is also important 
to the success of the system. This document reflects the three bases of Web
architecture: identification, interaction, and representation.</p>

Release early; release often.
Stefan Matthias Aust noticed some problems using <a href="http://cafeconleche.org/XOM/">XOM</a> beta 1 with Java 1.5 when the standard Xerces was not in the CLASSPATH
so I've posted beta 2 to fix the problem.
I would appreciate it if people could test this in both Java 1.4 and 1.5 without having any parsers besides the JDK bundled parsers in their classpaths. There are some pretty skanky hacks behind the scenes to make this all work seamlessly between different parsers and JVM versions, and I've stumbled across at least one major bug JDK 1.5 while implementing this. (Sun promises me the bug will be fixed in their next drop. For the moment, XOM uses a Sun-suggested work-around so it should still work until the underlying bug is fixed.)
</p>

<p>
While I was at it, I've used <a href="http://mercury.ccil.org/~cowan/XML/tagsoup/">TagSoup</a> to make the JavaDoc well-formed (possibly valid, I haven't checked) XHTML. tagsoup-0.9.7.jar is now bundled with the complete distributions. However it's only necessary to build XOM, not to run it.
</p>

<p>
None of the public APIs have changed in any way. All beta 1 and  alpha, code should still run without a recompile.

From the "I thought they were dead department", 
I'm pleased to note that Netscape 
has released <a href="http://wp.netscape.com/eng/mozilla/ns7/relnotes/7.html">version 7.2</a> of their namesake web browser for Mac OS X, Linux, and Windows 98 and later. This release is derived from Mozilla 1.7
and features pop-up blocking, tabbed browsing, 
fit-to-screen image sizing, full-screen mode, table editing,
Flash 7, and print preview. 
I haven't tested it, but assuming its XML support is similar to Mozilla's (and I have no reason to believe it's not) it should support XML, XHTML, CSS, XSLT, XLinks, and the XPointer <code>element()</code> and <code>xpath1()</code> schemes.

The IETF has published the proposed standard version of 
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-fielding-uri-rfc2396bis-06.txt">Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax</a>.
This is a replacement for  RFC 2396 that tries to actually be clear and consistent. When it comes to 
day-to-day use of URLs, this really doesn't change anything. 
However, the new spec  should be a lot more helpful to authors of specifications that depend on URLs and programmers who write URL processing software. 
The inconsistencies and poor language in RFC 2396
has long been a thorn in the Web's side. 
It's led otherwise intelligent and agreeable people into flame fests 
on such subjects as whether a relative URL is really a URL or just a URL referencm, arguments that often degenerate into, "I know the spec doesn't say that, but that's what it should say" or "That's what we meant it to say." Some of these problems have had real consequences for other specs. This new spec is much cleaner and should alleviate a lot fo those issues. <strong>Update</strong>: Tim Bray pointed out that this is actually more akin to a W3C last call working draft than a proposed standard. It's not quite as far along in the process as I thought.

<p>
I'm very pleased to announce the first beta of <a href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/XOM/">XOM 1.0</a>, my tree-based API for processing XML with Java. XOM emphasizes correctness, ease-of-use, and performance, <em>in that order</em>. It can also process documents in a streaming mode that handles documents larger than available memory.
Features include XML canonicalization, XInclude resolution, and XSL transformation. XPath queries are sadly lacking. :-(
</p>


<p>
You should note that my criteria for entering beta is much stricter than most. In particular unlike some companies who shall remain nameless but who <strong>release</strong> major operating systems with thousands of known bugs, XOM Beta 1 has exactly <strong>zero</strong> known bugs. It is feature complete. </p>

<p>
XOM has been tested in both client and server-side environments. It has been tested with a number of parsers including those bundled with Java 1.4 and 1.5. The internals of XOM have some pretty nasty hacks to work around various bugs in third party libraries it depends on, sometimes including the JDK itself. I'm fairly confident works as expected when bundled with the latest versions of Xerces and Xalan; and, aside from a few corner cases, works pretty damn well with earlier versions of these products and with other parsers and transformation engines too.
(The XOM unit tests are very tough. They have exposed numerous bugs in underlying libraries over the years. I picked Xerces and Xalan because the Apache Foundation has fixed the bugs I found while working on XOM.
All other parsers and transformation engines I've tested still have open bugs. Where possible, I've included code in XOM to work around known bugs, especially for processors bundled with JDKs, but it's not always been possible to do so.) 
</p>

<p>
I now believe XOM to be ready for production use. Of course, I could be wrong about that, which is why there's a beta cycle. I encourage you to try out this library, and let me know of any issues that arise, be they bugs, missing documentation, or weak performance. 
However, omitted functionality will probably have to wait for 1.1 to be filled in. Unless new bugs are uncovered, this may be the one and only beta release. All that's left on my TODO list before final release is finishing the documentation and doing some minor code clean-ups. These include such housekeeping tasks as splitting long lines, spell checking the comments, and making sure the Javadoc is all valid XHTML. It may take a few months before I get all of this done, but none of it should have any affect on client code. 
</p>

<p>
Beta 1 makes no backwards incompatible changes to the published API. Bug fixes since the final alpha include:
</p>

  <ul>
	<li> The XInclude test suite is loaded and run from the W3C CVS server if it's not installed locally. Mistakes in the test suite (mostly involving document type declarations) are corrected on the fly.</li>

	<li>   Work-arounds for various JDK bugs that prevent round-tripping of some characters in Japanese encodings</li>

	<li> Work-arounds for bugs in some versions of Xalan, as well for bugs in the OASIS XSLT conformance test suite.</li>

	<li>Improved compatibility with Java 1.5</li>
</ul>

<p>
XOM is published under the LGPL. Java 1.2 or later is required.

             <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/iri-edit/draft-duerst-iri-09.txt">Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs)</a>.
"An IRI is a sequence of characters from the
   Universal Character Set (Unicode/ISO 10646). A mapping from IRIs to
   URIs is defined, which means that IRIs can be used instead of URIs
   where appropriate to identify resources." In other words this lets you write URLs that use non-ASCII characters such as 
http://www.libÃ©ration.fr/. The non-ASCII characters would be converted to a genuine URI using hexadecimally escaped UTF-8. For instance,
http://www.libÃ©ration.fr/ becomes http://www.lib%C3%A9ration.fr/.
There's also an alternative, more complicated  syntax to be used when the DNS doesn't allow
percent escaped domain names. However, the other parts of the IRI (fragment ID, path, scheme, etc.) always use percent escaping.Comments are due by September 8.

I had a real revelation while talking about XOM at Extreme Markup Languages last week. As Larry Wall is fond of <a href="http://interviews.slashdot.org/interviews/02/09/06/1343222.shtml?tid=145">saying</a>, "Easy things should be easy, and hard things
should be possible."
The revelation I had was
that Wall's principle is almost tautological. What's easy and what's hard are functions of what the language allows and enables. A different language or API can make different tasks easy or hard. XOM is not designed around
Wall's principle. Instead it follows what I autonymously call Harold's principle: The right things should be easy, and the wrong things should be difficult to impossible. In other words, XOM is designed to make it easy to process XML as it was intended to be processed (e.g. using elements, attributes, and mixed content) and difficult to impossible to process using the wrong techniques (e.g. treating CDATA sections, attribute order, and encoding as semantically significant).

The final day of Extreme kicks off with Simon St. Laurent
talking about "<a href="http://www.mulberrytech.com/Extreme/Proceedings/html/2004/StLaurent01/EML2004StLaurent01.html">General parsed Entities: Unfinished Business</a>". 
Simon says he's the only presentation looking at the layers below XML rather than building on top of XML. General parsed entities mostly worked in the early days when he was writing <cite>XML: A Primer</cite>. "Then I discovered that general parsed entities don't actually work" because parsers are allowed to ignore external general entities. "If James Clark wrote it, it must be right", he says referring to expat and its lack of support for external general entities. He encountered problems in the real world when working with DocBook manuscripts at O'Reilly.
"Then there's the SGML envy problem which afflicts anyone who uses XML for an extended period of time." SDATA isn't necessary but CDATA and subdocs are cool.
XML provides enough rope to hang oneself, but not as comfortably as you could hang yourself with SGML. 
</p>
<p>
XInclude <code>parse="text"</code> replaces CDATA in SGML. XInclude content negotiation is a good thing. He thinks there's a real problem with character entities 
though the W3C disagrees. The last five years have seen a steady march away from DTDs. "No one wants to open up the XML spec and start over. I'll propose doing so later, but I don't expect to be taken seriously."
"Is there room for a general solution?" The solution for character entities is "dead simple". In general, he's presenting a system for resolving entities based on an XML instance document format defining the entities, and an extra processing layer.

The second session of the morning I switched rooms again to hear Walter Perry talk about 
<cite>Dealing with the Instance: Markup and Processing</cite>. According to the abstract, 
</p>

<blockquote>
The two practices which define our work are marking up instance texts and then processing those marked-up instances. A particular text might, or might not, be marked up within the confines of a particular vocabulary, schema or DTD, just as an instance text might or might not be processed within the constraints of a particular schematic, which might or might not be the schematic anticipated when the instance was marked up. Thus it is the instance which is crucial both to markup and to processing, and the schematic, if any, is not the primary subject of either. The implications of this premise will determine the future of our field and the applicability of our practices to discrete areas of expertise. In this presentation I intend to derive from this notion of instance-first a clear picture of what our practices must look like in order to carry out this premise and to fulfill its promise.
</blockquote>

<p>
Yesterday during a coffee break, Walter told me he's been working on marking up Sanskrit grammars for the last six months. Sometimes he might as well be writing in Sanskrit for all that people understand him. His ideas are so radically nonconformant that nobody ever understands him the first time they hear him, or believes him when they finally do understand him. 
But he's basically right.
</p>

<img src="images/extreme/walter.jpg" alt="" width="244" height="400" />
<p>
Talk begins. Markup and processing are both performed on the instance, not on the schematic. The instance is key. "The processor expects specific markup." It has to. If it can't find the markup it expects, it can't do its job. "Markup expects particular processing." "Processing expects particular markup." But expectations are <strong>not</strong> requirements.
"It is possible (and useful) to break the expected correlation of markup and processing." This allows us to achieve specific expertise in the process. This is useful for fraud detection, audits, and generation of different forms of output.</p>
<p>
Validation of output is more important than validation of input.
It is more important to produce what you need than to receive what you need.
Data structures belong to processes, not markup. Data structures are instantiated from the instance document and its markup. Expectations are generated by business processes, not by the documents and their markup.
Bills of lading turn into bills of shipping by the action of a process. 
Each separate document should be appropriate to what it is (and what the expertise of the process that created it is), not what it expects to be turned into. "This instance centricity is the complement of REST." 
</p>

<p>
Processes expect certain input. You can test instances that they comply to the document types that are expected as input. (Walter says, this is not quite the same as validation, though the difference is unclear to me.)
</p>

<p>
Someone in the audience is resisting the idea that one cannot reject 
invalid documents that nonetheless provide the actual information needed.
This always happens at Walter's talks. 
</p>

<p>
Markup delineates the author's reading of the document, but it loses intent.
Different processes have different intentions. 
</p>

<p>
He's telling a very interesting story about how standardized schemas 
eliminate the unique value and expertise of different organizations. 
I may have to transcribe this story later.
This reminds me a lot of <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html">Joel Spolsky's calls to never start over from scratch</a>. He says you should consolidate "like processes" (and only like processes).
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Create a catalog of instance documents</li>
	<li>Create a library of transforms to instantiate input to each process from every document consumed</li>
	<li>Create a library of transforms to instantiate output for each useful document from the process</li>
</ul>

<p>
<em>Processes</em> are easily schematized and rationalized by consolidation.

I'm editing this page  manually, almost  in realtime. I mentioned in the coffee break that I was having trouble keeping it well-formed. I don't want the DTD to force me to fill in end-tags and such before I'm ready; but
it would be nice if BBEdit (or another editor) gave me a little icon somewhere that indicated the current status of the document, 
perhaps a green check mark for well-formed, a red X for malformed.

Bruce Rosenblum (co-author Irina Golfman)
is giving the final regular session on
"<a href="http://www.mulberrytech.com/Extreme/Proceedings/html/2004/Rosenblum01/EML2004Rosenblum01.html">Automated quality assurance for heuristic-based XML creation systems.</a>"
Schemas aren't enough. Validity isn't enough. By show of hands, 
the vast majority of the authors at this conference used hand editing in emacs or equivalent to write their papers.
He's looking at heuristic based, pattern based, and manual conversion from 
existing documents. In these cases we need quality assurance beyond simply validating against a DTD or a schema.
</p>

Some techniques like color coding help manual proofing a lot. But they want more automated checking. They want to run a test suite across the output of an automatic conversion. So far the techniques seem pretty obvious. 
This is nothing anybody accustomed to running automated test suites on software doesn't already know. They're just testing that their software that converts existing data to XML runs properly. Maybe this is news to some XML-developers (though I doubt it) but anybody doing extreme programming already knows this. 

Their test suite takes in the ballpark of 8-10 hours to run so they do overnight testing rather than continuous testing.

As is tradition, Michael Sperberg-McQueen delivers the closing keynote.
The nominal title is "Runways, product differentiation, snap-together joints, airplane glue, and switches that really switch." The question is "Does XML have a model? A supermodel? Does it matter?"
</p>

<img src="images/extreme/mcqueen.jpg" alt="" width="441" height="400" />
<p>
He begins by talking about glottal stops and learning Danish to read secondary literature about Norse sagas. As an English speaker, he couldn't hear glottal stops. He doesn't understand the effort to drop models into XML any more than he could hear glottal stops. He feels like an alien. He doesn't know what people mean by <i>models</i>. He describes various meanings of the word <i>model</i> and decides they don't apply. Model trains, fashion models. One use of the word <i>model</i> is for things that are a simplification or theory of reality, possibly discredited (phlogiston model of fire, Rutherford model of the atom). Something has to be different between a model and the real thing. Useful models are simpler, or more familiar, or easier to calculate with.
</p>

<p>
He's suspicious of having <strong>a</strong> model.
He wants different models at different times
because not all models capture the same things. To understand the model of SGML you have to understand the difference between a document type declaration and a document type definition. <!-- transcribe; there's a good long qotd here--> He's bringing up Wilkins and Leibnitz's effort to design a perfect language that does not allow untruthful statements.
(Shades of <cite><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN%3D0380977427/ref%3Dnosim/cafeaulaitA/">QuickSilver</a></cite>, <cite><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN%3D0060523867/ref%3Dnosim/cafeaulaitA/">The Confusion</a></cite>, and Daniel Waterhouse.) But we do not believe there is a perfect universal vocabulary. SQL is too constrained by a single model. Thus, "users of SQL miss XML, but users of XML don't miss SQL." The lack of a single data model is a strength of XML.
The models are owned by the users, not by ISO or the W3C. "Go forth and become models."

<dt id="news2004August5">Thursday, August 5, 2004</dt><dd>
<p>
Day 3 of Extreme kicks off with the W3C's Liam Quin 
(who does win the weirdest hat award for the conference) 
talking about the status of binary XML, though he's careful not to
use the phrase "binary XML" since that's a bit of an oxymoron. 
</p>

<img src="images/extreme/liam.jpg" alt="" width="639" height="536" />

<p>
The W3C recently published  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-xbc-use-cases-20040728/">XML Binary Characterization Use Cases</a>.
I haven't had the time to read through all the use cases yet, 
but what I've skimmed through so far is not compelling. I'll probably read through this and respond when I get back to New York next week. 
</p>

<p>
Last night, Liam told me the W3C has not decided whether or not this effort makes sense. They're worried that if they don't do anything, somebody else may or, worse yet, a hundred different people may do a hundred different things. It's not clear that one format can solve everybody's use cases, or even a majority of the use cases. However, I get the impression that the W3C is convinced that if one format would solve a lot of use cases, they'd like to do it. 
</p>
<p>
This would be a horrible mistake. 
Of course, there are legitimate needs for binary data; but nothing is gained by polluting XML with binary data. Text readability is an important corner stone of XML. It is a large part of what makes XML so interoperable. XML does what it does so well precisely because it is text. Adding binary data would simply bloat existing tools, while providing no benefit to existing applications. To the extent there's a need for binary data, what's needed are completely new formats optimized for different use cases. There is no call for a single uber-format that tries to be all things to all people, and likely ends up being nothing to no one.
</p>

<p>
C. Michael Sperberg-McQueen is talking about "Pulling the ladder up behind you", asking whether we're resisting 
an attempt to resist a hostile takeover of the spec or pulling up the ladder behind us. He doesn't know the answer, but I do. We are resisting a hostile takeover. Other groups are free to build other ladders that fit their needs. 
He mentions that there was a binary SGML effort at one point. 
It's not clear how far it got. Anyone know what happened to it?
</p>

<p>
Liam Quinn: "We're all sisters in the church of XML," and he's challenging the orthodoxy of that church. Once a week someone contacts him and says they need binary XML, but these people often don't know what they mean by "binary XML." Liam says, they're not looking at an incompatible document format; just different ways to transfer the regular XML documents.  (I disagree, and I think his statement's more than a little jesuitical. Most of the proposals clearly anticipate changing the infoset and APIs. If the W3C is ruling out such efforts, they should state that clearly.)
</p>

<p>
Various goals for binary XML:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>"You don't know what you're doing or you're a looney,"
	says the man wearing a blinking orange crown. :-)</li>
	<li>Reduced bandwidth</li>
	<li>Reduced storage</li>
	<li>Faster to parse</li>
	<li>Lower memory usage (especially in so far as it leads to increased battery life)</li>
	<li>Random Access</li>
</ul>

<p>
Cell phones and other micro devices are an important use case.
However, as I discussed with Liam last night, there's a question whether these will still be small enough for this to be a problem by the time any binary XML spec were finished. Someone in the audience mentions that 
at least one cell phone now has a gigabyte of memory (though that serves double duty as both disk and RAM). Moore's law may solve this problem faster than a spec can be agreed on and implemented, though. 
</p>

<p>
The W3C is not interested in hardware-specific, time-sensitive, or 
schema-required formats. Encryption is not a goal. 
</p>

<p>
Costs of binary XML:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Reduces interoperability</li>
	<li>Harder to debug</li>
	<li>Creates islands of binary goop</li>
	<li>"Weakens religious dogma that all processors understand all documents"</li>
</ul>

<p>
"WAP stands for totally useless protocol."
</p>

<p>
Benefits:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>Embrace new communities: XML compatible structures can be used where at present XML is not used now</li>
	<li>Embrace new technologies (e.g. graphics, maps)</li>
	<li>Open up information currently stored in proprietary binary formats</li>
</ol>

<p>
Me: 1 is disingenuous. Redefining XML as something new does not truly expand the universe of what's done with XML. 
2 is done today with text XML. It's not clear binary XML is necessary.
There are some size issues here for some documents, but these use cases are very well addressed by gzip. 
3 is a very good idea, but has nothing to do with XML. It could be done with a non-XML format. 
</p>

<p>
Liam: The question is not whether we have binary XML-like formats or not. The question is whether we have many or few. Me: It sounds like there's a real control issue here. The W3C gets very nervous with the idea that somebody besides them might define this. Even if they decide it's a bad idea, they'd rather be the one to write the spec than letting someone else do it. They do say a lot of people have come to them asking for this. They did not initiate it. 
</p>

<p>
Side note: In Q&amp;A Liam misunderstands web services.
He sees it as an alternative to CORBA/IDL rather than an alternative to REST, and therefore thinks it's a good thing.
</p>

<p>
This has been a few quick notes typed as I listened. I'll have more to say about this here in a week or so.

<hr />
<p>
The second, less controversial topic of the morning, is Microsoft's
Matthew Fuchs'
talk on "<a href="http://www.mulberrytech.com/Extreme/Proceedings/html/2004/Fuchs01/EML2004Fuchs01.html">Achieving extensibility and reuse for XSLT 2.0 stylesheets</a>".
He's a self-avowed advocate of object orientation in XML. He's going to talk about how to use the OO features of the W3C XML Schema Language in conjunction with XSLT2 (especially XPath 2.0's <code>element()</code> and <code>attribute()</code> functions to achieve extensibility in the face of unexpected changes.
</p>

<img src="images/extreme/fuchs.jpg" alt="" width="639" height="387" />
<hr />
<p>
Stephan Kesper is presenting a <a href="http://www.mulberrytech.com/Extreme/Proceedings/html/2004/Kepser01/EML2004Kepser01.html">simple proof that XSLT and XQuery are Turing complete</a> using &mu;-recursive functions. There is no concept known that is more powerful for computation  than a Turing machine. It is believed but not proved that no such more powerful concept of computation that exists.
On the other hand, what exactly a "concept of computation" means is not precisely specified, so this is uncertain. 
</p>
<img src="images/extreme/stephan.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" />

<p>
His technique requires stacks, which he implements using <code>concat()</code>, <code>substring-before()</code>, and <code>substring-after()</code>. Hmm, that seems  a bit surprising. I don't think of these functions as a core part of XSLT. I wonder if the proof could be rewritten without using these functions? Kesper thinks so, but the proof would been much more complex.
</p>

<p>
The XQuery proof is much simpler, because XQuery allows function definition.
</p>

<p>
He really hates XSLT's XML-based syntax. He much prefers XQuery. He thinks (incorrectly IMO) that XSLT is machine oriented and XQuery is more human oriented.
</p>

<p>
In Q&amp;A Norm Walsh, thinks the proof depends on a bug in Saxon
(Kesper disagrees). The question is whether it's legal to dynamically choose the template name to be called by <code>xsl:call-template</code>; i.e., is the name attribute of <code>xsl:call-template</code> an attribute value template or not?
The audience can't decide. Hmm, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt#named-templates">looking at the spec</a>, I think Norm is right, but Dimitre Novatchev may have presented a <a href="http://fxsl.sourceforge.net/">workaround</a> for this last year so the flaw in the proof may be fixable. 
</p>

<p>
I could follow most of  the last paper, barely. This next one,
"<a href="http://www.mulberrytech.com/Extreme/Proceedings/html/2004/Bruggemann-Klein01/EML2004Bruggemann-Klein01.xml">Balanced context-free grammars, hedge grammars and pushdown caterpillar automata</a>", by Anne BrÃ¼ggemann-Klein, (co-author Derrik Wood)
may run right past my limits so take what I write with a grain of salt. 
She says the referees made the same comments. 
 According to the abstract,
</p>


<blockquote>
The XML community generally takes trees and hedges as the model for XML document instances and element content. In contrast, computer scientists like Berstel and Boasson have discussed XML documents in the framework of extended context-free grammar, modeling XML documents as Dyck strings and schemas as balanced grammars. How can these two models be brought closer together? We examine the close relationship between Dyck strings and hedges, observing that trees and hedges are higher level abstractions than are Dyck primes and Dyck strings. We then argue that hedge grammars are effectively identical to balanced grammars, and that balanced languages are identical to regular hedge languages, modulo encoding. From the close relationship between Dyck strings and hedges, we obtain a two-phase architecture for the parsing of balanced languages. This architecture is based on a caterpillar automaton with an additional pushdown stack.
</blockquote>

<img src="images/extreme/anne.jpg" alt="" width="509" height="479" />

<p>
She's actually only going to talk about hedges, and omitting the Dyck strings to make the talk easier to digest. A hedge differs from a forest in that the individual trees are placed in order. In a forest, the trees have no specified order. 
</p>

<p>
In DTDs element names and types are conflated.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
I wish the conference put the papers online earlier. 
They should be up after the conference is over, but for these more
technical talks it would be really helpful to be able to read the paper
to clarify the points, not to mention I could link to them for people reading remotely who aren't actually here. 
</p>
<hr />
<p>
This conference has good wireless access. I've also recorded a few talks for later relistening using my laptop's built-in microphone. It makes me wonder if it might be possible to stream the conference out? I suspect the organizers might have something to say about that, but it would be interesting to webcast an entire conference in realtime, not just an occasional keynote. 
</p>
<hr />
<p>
The afternoon sessions split between the data-heads and the doc-heads.
Since I have feet planted firmly in each camp, I had some tough choices to make but I decided to start with the docheads and TEI. Lou Burnard
is talking about "Relaxing with Son of ODD, or What the TEI did Next"
(co-author Sebastian Rahtz). According to the abstract,
</p>

<blockquote>
The Text Encoding Initiative is using literate schema design, as instantiated in the completely redesigned ODD system, for production of the next edition of the TEI Guidelines. Key new aspects of the system include support of multiple schema languages; facilities for interoperability with other ontologies and vocabularies; and facilities for user customization and modularization (including a new web-based tool for schema generation). We'll try to explain the rationale behind the ongoing revision of the TEI Guidelines, how the new tools developed to go with it are taking shape, and describe the mechanics by which the new ODD system delivers its promised goals of customizability and extensibility, while still being a good citizen of a highly inter-operable digital world.
</blockquote>

<img src="images/extreme/odd.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="395" />

<p>
TEI v5 is a major update. They're using Perforce to manage the content management system, and are experimenting with switching to eXist.
They chose RELAX NG for the schema language. "DTDs are not XML, and need specialist software." W3C XML Schema Language is much too complex.
They use Trang to convert the RELAX NG schemas.</p>

<p>
At this point, lunch began to disagree with me so I had to make a quick exit back to my room and missed the rest of the talk. :-( 
I really shouldn't have had that second dessert.
But in the elevator  on the way up, 
I did consider  how many projects are switching to RELAX NG. TEI is just the latest victory. Others include DocBook, XHTML 2, and SVG. 
</p>
<hr />
<p>
Blaise Doughan of Oracle (co-author Donald Smith) 
is talking about Mapping Java Objects to XML and Relational Databases. Michael Sperberg-McQueen objects to classifying Oracle as a relational database in his introduction to the talk.
</p>

<img src="images/extreme/blaise.jpg" alt="" width="639" height="423" />

<p>
So far this looks like another W3C XML Schema Language based Java-XML data binding system. The difference from JAXB is that they use XPath to define the mappings rather than element names.
A question from the audience points out that they've made the classic database-centric mistake of ignoring arity problems 
(i.e. what happens when an element contains multiple child elements of the same type/name). They do support position based mapping. The demo crashed.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
The final session of the day is <a href="http://www.nwalsh.com/">Norm Walsh</a> talking about "<a href="http://www.mulberrytech.com/Extreme/Proceedings/html/2004/Walsh01/EML2004Walsh01.html">Extreme DocBook</a>", particularly the redesign of DocBook in version 5.0 using RELAX NG.
This is called <a href="http://docbook.org/docbook-ng/">DocBook NG</a>. There's currently an experimental "Eaux de Vie" release.
"DocBook is my hammer." DocBook has about 400 elements, about half of which have mixed content and almost none have simple content. It is a DTD for prose.
</p>
<img src="images/extreme/normwalsh.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="399" />
<p>
It was originally designed as an exchange format, but today it's pretty much just an authoring format.
DocBook has grown by accretion. Thus, it's time to start over.
Plus the DTD fails to capture all the constraints.
They'll use Relax NG. <a href="http://www.thaiopensource.com/relaxng/trang.html">Trang</a> can convert to W3C XML Schemas, but Trang
isn't smart enough to produce the DTD.
</p>

<p>
RELAX NG patterns allow DocBook NG to combine elements (e.g. one <code>info</code> element instead of <code>book.info</code>, <code>chapter.info</code>, <code>article.info</code>, etc.) while still allowing different content models in different places. 
DocBook NG has only 356 elements.
</p>

<p>
He also like's RELAX NG's <code>&amp;</code> connector for unordered content. Co-constraints are useful too. This all allows him to untangle the conflicting CALS and HTML table models. (Wouldn't namespaces be a better fix here?)
A few elements such as <code>pubdate</code> benefit from RELAX NG data types (but this is arguable). 
</p>

<p>
For what RELAX NG can't specify, they'll use a rule-based technology such as Schematron. This could implement an exclusion. 
</p>

<p>
Traditionally the version of DocBook has been identified by the public ID. This no longer applies, so a <code>version</code> attribute is needed. 
This is also useful for referential integrity constraints, such as a <code>footnoteref</code> points to a <code>footnote</code>. They can embed Schematron in a RELAX NG schema.
</p>
<p>
Ease of use, including ease of subsetting and extending,
is crucial. Migration issues are also important. XSLT helps.
His XSLT stylesheet to convert covers about 94% of the test cases.
</p>

<p>
He doesn't think the W3C XML Schema language is the right abstraction for schemas that have lots of mixed content such as DocBook. John Cowan: "XML DTDs are a weak and non-conforming syntax for RELAX NG".

I've installed a server side spam filter. Hopefully this will bring my e-mail load down to a manageable level, even when I'm on a low-speed connection or accessing my e-mail via pine. On the flip side, even though it's set to a very conservative level, it's now more likely that I'll miss
a few messages since it's much harder to check my spam folder on the server than on the client. If you send something important to me, and you expect a response and don't get it, it might be worth contacting me in some other way. It's funny how dependent we've become on e-mail. John Cowan and I are in the same building for a few days (a relatively rare event) and we're still trading e-mail with each other while tracking down a buggy interaction between XOM and TagSoup. 
</p>
<hr />
<p>
Murphy's Law strikes again. Five minutes after I wrote the last entry,
I'm at the coffee break and John Cowan comes up to me and says, "I got your e-mail but I didn't understand it. What did you mean?" We straightened it out quickly. Sometimes it pays to be physically present. :-)

<p>
The <a href="http://www.extrememarkup.com/extreme/2004/wednesday.asp">second day of Extreme Markup Languages 2004</a> began with Ian Gorman's presentation on 
<a href="hhttp://www.mulberrytech.com/Extreme/Proceedings/html/2004/Gorman01/EML2004Gorman01.html">GXParse</a>, about which I'm afraid I can't say too much because I was 
busy getting 
ready for my own <a href="http://cafeconleche.org/slides/extreme/xom/">presentation</a> on <a href="http://www.mulberrytech.com/Extreme/Proceedings/html/2004/Harold01/EML2004Harold01.html">XOM Design Principles</a> which was, I'm happy to say, well received. The big question from the audience was whether 
Java 1.5 and generics changed any of this. The answer is that XOM needs to support Java 1.4 (and indeed 1.3 and 1.2) so generics are not really an option. If I were willing to require Java 1.5 for XOM, the answer might be different. Still it might not be
because the lack of type safety in generics is a big problem.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
Following the coffee break, B. Tommie Usdin is giving Steve DeRose's paper (Steve wasn't here for some reason) on Markup overlap: A review and a horse. It was very entertaining, even if Usdin and the audience didn't always agree on what DeRose was actually trying to say in his paper. 
This amusing session was followed by Wendell Piez (who is here) 
delivering his own talk on <a href="http://www.mulberrytech.com/Extreme/Proceedings/html/2004/Piez01/EML2004Piez01.html">Half-steps toward LMNL (Layered Markup and Annotation Language)</a>.</p>

<img src="images/extreme/piez.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="333" />

<p>
The question in both of these papers 
(and a couple of earlier sessions I missed while in the other track)
is how to handle overlapping markup such as</p>

<pre><code>&lt;para>David said, 
&lt;&lt;quote>I tell you, I was nowhere near your house. 
I've never been to your house!
I don't know who took your cat. 
I don't even know what your cat looks like.
&lt;/para>
&lt;para>
Why are you accusing me of this anyway? 
It's because you don't like my dog, isn't it? 
You've never liked my dog!
You're a dog hater!
&lt;/quote>. 
At that moment, David's bag began to roll around on the floor and meow.
&lt;/para>
</code></pre>
<p>
Apparently, this sort of structure shows up frequently in 
Biblical studies. 
</p>
<hr />
<p>
The afternoon begins with a session that looks quite interesting.
Christian Siefkes is scheduled to talk about
"<a href="http://www.mulberrytech.com/Extreme/Proceedings/html/2004/Siefkes01/EML2004Siefkes01.html">A shallow algorithm for correcting nesting errors and other well-formedness violations in XML-like input.</a>" According to the abstract,
</p>

<blockquote>
There are some special situations where it can be useful to repair well-formedness violations occurring in XML-like input. Examples from our own work include character-level and simple nesting errors, widowed tags, and missing root elements. We analyze the types of errors that can occur in XML-like input and present a shallow algorithm that fixes most of these errors, without requiring knowledge of a DTD or XML Schema.
</blockquote>

<p>
I tried to do something like this with XOM and eventually decided it was just too unreliable. You couldn't be sure you were inserting the missing end-tags in the right places. I'm curious to see how or whether he's addressed this problem. 
</p>



<p>
XML has "The most conservative appproach to error handling I have ever heard of." The idea is to repair the errors at the generating side, not the receving side, because different receivers might repair it differently.
(Right away that's a difference with what I was trying in XOM.)
XML-like input is input that is meant to be XML, but may be malformed.
Possible errors include:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Unescaped &lt; and &amp;</li>
	<li>Simple overlap errors wheree end-atgs are in wrong order</li>
	<li>Singleton start- or end-tags</li>
	<li>Missing/multiple root elements</li>
</ul>

<img src="images/extreme/siefkes.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="359" />

<p>
He's interested mostly in errors caused by programs that automatically add markup to existing documents by linguistic analysis on plain text. 
But also by errors caused by human authoring.
</p>

<p>
When fixing tags, need to choose heuristics. For instance, should the end-tag for a widowed start-tag be placed immediately after the start-tag or as far away as possible?
</p>

<p>
A mutlipass algorithm. The first pass tokenizes and fixes character errors such as unescaped &lt; signs and missing quotes on attribute values. Second pass fills in missing tags. It's not always possible to do this perfectly.
Overall, this looks mildly useful, but there's nothing really earth-shattering here. 
</p>
<hr />
<p>
For the second session of the afternoon, I swapped roooms away from a session that smelled of the semantic web into a more user-interface focused session delivered by Y. S. Kuo (co-authors N. C. Shih, Lendle Tseng, and Jaspher Wang) on "Avoiding syntactic violations in Forms-XML". 
Thi seems to be about some sort of XML editing forms toolkit.
</p>

<img src="images/extreme/kuo.jpg" alt="" width="639" height="267" />

<p>
Current XML editors provide a text view, a tree view, and/or 
a presentation view. He thinks only the presentation view is appropriate for end users. I tend to agree. He thinks narrative-focused
XML editors are more mature than editors for record-like documents
so he's going to concentrate on the latter. Syntactic constraints are independent of the user interface layout.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
The final session of the day is a panel discussion of 
"Update on the Topic Map Reference Model." Hard as it is to believe,
Patrick is not wearing the strangest hat at this conference.
</p>

<img src="images/extreme/topicmaps.jpg" alt="Patrick as Gandalf" width="639" height="335" />

<p>
First up is  Lars Marius Garshol. In the beginning there was no topic map model. Topic maps use XLinks. PMTM4, a graph based model with three kinds of modes  vs. the infoset based model. These two models were trying to do completely different things. Now there are two different models,
reference Model and Data Model. No user will ever interact with the model directly. The model is marketing machinery.
</p>


<p>
Now Patrick Durusau. "The goal is to define what it means to be a 
'topic map',
independent of implementation detail or data model concerns" so that user of different implementations can merge their topic maps. 
They want more people to join the mailing list and give input.
</p>

<p>
Tommie Usdin wants to know if when the panel sees something they always all agree on whether it is or is not a topic map. The answer appears to be no,
they do not know one when they see it, at least if this requires agreeing on what is and isn't a topic map, even though there is an ISO standard that describes this.
</p>

John Cowan is delivering a nocturne on <a href="http://mercury.ccil.org/~cowan/XML/tagsoup/">TagSoup</a>, a SAX2
parser for ugly, nasty HTML. It processes HTML as it is, not as it should be.
"Almost all data is ugly legacy data at any given time. Fashions change."
However, this does not work with XHTML! Empty-element tags are not supported. TagSoup is driven by a custom schema in a custom language.
It generates well-formed XML 1.0.
It does not guarantee namespace well-formedness. <a href="http://mercury.ccil.org/~cowan/XML/tagsoup/tsaxon/">TSaxon</a> is a fork of Saxon 6.5.3 that bundles TagSoup. Simon St. Laurent: "It's nice when people give you the same crap over and over instead of different crap." Cowan demoed TagSoup over a bunch of nasty HTML people submitted on a poster over the last couple of days. 
It mostly worked, with one well-formedness error (an attribute named 4).

I'm pleased to see the conference has put out lots of power strips 
for laptops. And in a stroke of genius, they're all in the first 
three rows so people have to come to the front of the room to get power 
rather than hiding in the back. :-)

Over 2000 messages piled up in my INBOX since Saturday. 
29 of them weren't spam. It didn't help that IBiblio recently 
decided to start accepting messages from servers that don't follow the 
SMTP specs correctly. Since I'm on my laptop I'm logging into the server
and scanning the headers manually with pine, rather than using Eudora and my normal spam filters. This probably makes me more likely to accidentally delete important email, especially since pine occasionally confuses my terminal emulator when faced with the non-ASCII subject lines of a lot of  spam, so I don't always see the right headers. If you're expecting a response from me, and don't get one, try resending the message next week.

I'm typing this on my PowerBook G4 running Mac OS X.
This means a lot of the Mac OS 9 AppleScripts I use to do things like 
change the quote of the day and increment the day's news
don't work. I expect to be upgrading my main  work system to
Mac OS X in the next month or two (depending on when Apple finally ships the G5 I ordered a month and a half ago) so I really need to update 
all these scripts to work with Mac OS X. Right now this is all done with 
regular expressions and baling wire. The only excuse I can offer for this is that these are legacy scripts that were originally developed for 
Cafe au Lait in the pre-XML years. However, the regular expressions package 
doesn't work in Mac OS X, and as long as I'm rewriting this anyway I might as well base it on XML. 
Does anyone know of a good XML parser for Mac OS X that's AppleScriptable?
So far the only one I've found only runs in the classic environment.
 could probably teach myself enough about Mac programming in Objective C to write an AppleScript wrapper around Xerces, but surely someone's done this already?

B. Tommie Usdin is giving the keynote address,
"Don't pull up the ladder behind you." From the abstract it sounds like she may be targeting me (among others):
</p>

<blockquote>
The papers submitted for Extreme Markup Languages in 2004 were remarkable in a number of ways. There were more of them than we have ever received before, and their technical quality was, on the whole, better than we have received before. More were based on real-life experience and more used formalisms. Also new this year, however, was a tendency to identify, poorly characterize, and then attack a specification, technology, or approach seen as competition to the authorâs. I saw evidence of the implicit assumption that there is limited space for XML applications and specifications and that success of one limits the opportunity for success for another. It is this attitude that leads to âspecification poachingâ and a variety of other anti-social behaviors that can in fact hurt us all. I believe that XML-space is in fact not limited any more than, for example, UNICODE-space is limited. We can and should learn from each otherâs requirements, applications, and implementations. Pulling up that ladder after yourself in this environment hurts not only the people who want to come after you, it hurts you by limiting your access to new ideas, techniques, and opportunities.
</blockquote>

<p>
I definitely do target some other technologies in my presentation on XOM.
However, it's not because I think there's only room for one spec in a space. It's because I think some of the competitors are actively harmful in a number of ways. 20 competing APIs may be a good thing, but only if all 20 of the APIs are good when considered in isolation. One of the nice things about having a plethora of APIs is we can differentiate
the good from the bad, and throw away the bad ones. When there's only one API we're stuck with it, and we may not even realize how bad it is, (*cough* DOM *cough*).
15 bad APIs and 5 good ones just confuses everyone and costs productivity.
It's better to pick and choose only the technologies that actually work.
But I'll get my own 45 minutes to argue this point tomorrow. :-)

Usdin is talking now. She says there were some problems with MathML and
internal DTD subsets in the paper submissions, plus one person who insisted that XML was only for bank transactions and it was ridiculous to write conference papers in anything other than Word. MathML may be ready for prime time but is not yet ready for amateur use. She believes in shared document models and doesn't like when people make up their own markup,
even when the document submitted is in fact valid. In other words, she doesn't like internal DTD subsets; because this really breaks the whole notion of validity. You can't easily check the validity of  a document against the external DTD subset without using the internal DTD subset too. 
Me: Interesting. I've known the internal DTD subset was a major source of problems for parser implementers for a long time, but it seems to be a problem for users, even experienced users, too. More evidence that XML made the wrong cut on how parsers behave. Parsers should be able to ignore the internal DTD subset, but the spec doesn't allow this
</p>


<p>
Now she's talking about pulling up the ladder behind us. 
She seems mostly focused on different XML applications (vocabularies) rather than 
libraries and APIs. 
</p>

<ul>
	<li>RELAX NG vs. DTDs vs. schemas</li>
	<li>XLink vs. link tags</li>
	<li>The regular XML model for narrative text</li>
	<li>Authorities (W3C, OASIS, etc.) require compatibility with existing specs for new specs, even when the requirements for the new specs don't exactly match the requirements for the old specs. e.g. coffee growers vs. coffee consumers</li>
	<li><acronym title="XSL Formatting Objects">XSL-FO</acronym> is weakened by requirement to be compatible with CSS</li>
	<li>Hijacking of spec</li>
	<li>"Complete" specifications pull up the ladder behind them.</li>
	<li>Refrain from gratuitous standardization</li>
</ul>

<p>
She compares this to Unicode. Unicode doesn't try to stop other people from using Unicode. I note that Unicode does actively try to stop competing character encodings though. Overall though, it sounds like I might have misguessed where this talk is going. Her objection is to overspecifying the 
applications of XML, not the core technologies on which these applications build.

James David Mason (co-author Thomas M. Insalaco) of the
Y-12 National Security Complex are talking about 
"<a href="http://www.mulberrytech.com/Extreme/Proceedings/html/2004/Mason01/EML2004Mason01.html">Navigating the production maze: The Topic-Mapped enterprise.</a>"
According to the abstract, "A manufacturing enterprise is an intricate web of links among products, their components, their materials, and the facilities and trained staff needed to turn materials into components and completed products. The Y-12 National Security Complex, owned by the U.S. Department of Energy, has a rather specialized product line, but its problems are typical of large-scale manufacturing in many high-tech industries. A self-contained microcosm of manufacturing, Y-12 has foundries, rolling mills, chemical processing facilities, machine shops, and assembly lines. Faced with the need to maintain products that may have been built decades ago, Y-12 needs to develop information-management capabilities that can find out rapidly for example, what tools are needed to make parts for a particular product or, if tools are replaced, which products will be affected. A topic map, still in preliminary development, reflects a portion of Y-12's web of relationships by treating the products in detail, the component flows, and the facilities and tools available. This topic map has already taught us new things about Y-12. We hope to extend the topic map by including other operational aspects, such as the skills and staffing levels necessary to operate its various processes."

Legacy issues are a big deal for them. They need to be able to resume production on very old equipment with a 36 month lead time. They need to be able to rebuild anything, even though original suppliers like Dupont may not make the components anymore.

Ain't Google wonderful?) Topic maps integrate the data. They help
people understand the data, and helps find errors in the existing data.
Naming issues (e.g. oralloy vs. enriched uranium) are a big deal.
They need to be able to unite topics that go by different names.
Access to the data is an as yet unsolved issue, and needs to be added to the ontology. They want to show different associations depending on credentials.

"<a href="http://www.mulberrytech.com/Extreme/Proceedings/html/2004/Degler01/EML2004Degler01.html">Maintaining ontology implementations: The art of listening.</a>"
They do government work too. They're giving an example of shopping for a car. They seem to be interpreting the inability to find what they want
as a metadata problem. I suspect it's more of a user interaction problem.
Specifically, web sites tend to be designed according to the mental model of the publisher, rather than the mental model of the reader.
This is why you can search for cars by model number but not by four-seat convertible. Auto dealers think about model numbers. Consumers think about 
features.
But they don't believe that. They want to listen to the users' questions
to evolve the language and refine the topic maps 
Specifically they want to monitor search requests, Q&amp;A requests, threaded discussions, etc. Lewis says, "Topic map versioning we put on the back burner because it looked big and ugly."
It sounds like a good idea overall, but it's a little light on the practical specifics. User buy-in and management approval is a big problem.

The afternoon sessions split into two tracks. 
I'm skipping topic maps for 
Bryan Thompson talking about
"Server-Side XPointer" (Co-authors:  Graham Moore,  Bijan Parsia, 
and Bradley R. Bebee) He wants to relate core REST principles to linking and document interchange.
RESTful interfaces should be opaque. You shouldn't be able to see what's behind the URI. Generic semantics based on request method and response codes.
</p>
<img src="images/extreme/bryan.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="357" />
<p>
POST to create a resource and PUT to update one?!? That sounds backwards.
XPointer is not just XPath. It is extensible to new schemes. Clients don't need to understand these schemes! It's enough that the server understand them! Now that he's said it, it's obvious. I don't know why I didn't see this before. It makes XPointers much more useful. Use range-unit field in HTTP header to say "xpointer". The server responds with 206 Partial Content. Hmm, this does require some client support. He doesn't like the XML data model and XPath for addressing. These aren't extensible enough.
We need to use more application specific addressing schemes and content negotiation.

The next talk has Sebastian Schaffert giving a 
"<a href="http://www.mulberrytech.com/Extreme/Proceedings/html/2004/Schaffert01/EML2004Schaffert01.html">Practical Introduction to Xcerpt</a>" (co-author FranÃ§ois Bry).
He says current query languages intertwine querying with document construction which makes them unsuitable for reasoning with meta-data, a la the Semantic Web. He uses an alternate syntax called "data terms" that is less verbose than XML, and not a strict isomorphism because they want to research alternate possibilities.

Jeremy J. Carroll (co-author Patrick Stickler) is talking about <a href="http://www.mulberrytech.com/Extreme/Proceedings/html/2004/Stickler01/EML2004Stickler01.html">RDF Triples in XML</a>
(TriX). RDF can be serialized in XML but is not XML, and is not about markup. The graph should be obvious, more N-triples than RDF/XML.
It uses <code>uri</code>, <code>plainLiteral</code>, <code>id</code>, and <code>typedLiteral</code> elements, all of which contain plain text. A triple element contains a subject, predicate and object.
(Order matters.) The predicate must be a <code>uri</code>, but the subject can be a literal. A <code>graph</code> contains triples and can be named with a  <code>uri</code>. A <code>trix</code> can contain multiple <code>graph</code>s. Interesting idea: XSL transform can be applied before RDF validation to transform document into the form to be validated. That's it. This seems much simpler than RDF/XML.

In the final regular session of the day, 
Eric Miller (co-author  C. M. Sperberg-McQueen)
is talking about
 "<a href="http://www.mulberrytech.com/Extreme/Proceedings/html/2004/Sperberg-McQueen01/EML2004Sperberg-McQueen01.html">On mapping from colloquial XML to RDF using XSLT</a>".
 This is about schema annotation. Two kinds of data integration:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Integrating data from DTD X into DTD Y</li>
	<li>Creation of DTD-neutral information stores; i.e. RDF</li>
</ul>

<p>
He's talking about the second type. Apple's plist format is really nasty.
But it works for Apple. Use XSLT to transform to what we want,
but this data is too valuable to be sitting in make files, so put it in the schemas.

The W3C XML Schema Working Group has published an updated
 working draft of 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-xmlschema-ref-20040716/">XML Schema: Component Designators</a>.
This spec proposes a scheme for naming and 
identifying  XML Schema
components. Such  components include: </p>

<ul> <li>Simple and complex type definitions</li>
<li>Attribute
declarations</li>
<li>Element declarations</li>
<li>Attribute and
model group definitions</li>
<li>Identity-constraint
definitions</li>
<li>Notation declarations</li>
<li>Annotations</li>
<li>Model groups</li>
<li>Particles</li>
<li>Wildcards</li>
<li>Attribute uses</li>
<li>The master schema
component representing the schema as a whole.</li>
<li>Facets</li> </ul>

<p> The goal is to be able to name, for example, the
literallayout notation in the DocBook schema, as well as every
other significant piece of the schema. These names could then be used as fragment identifiers in URI references that point to schemas. The draft gives these examples of the current syntax proposal:
 </p>


<pre>schema-URI#xscd(/type(Items))
schema-URI#xscd(/type(Items)/item)
schema-URI#xscd(/type(Items)/item/type())
schema-URI#xscd(/type(Items)/item/productName)
schema-URI#xscd(/type(Items)/item/quantity)
schema-URI#xscd(/type(Items)/item/quantity/type())
schema-URI#xscd(/type(Items)/item/quantity/type()/facet(maxExclusive))
schema-URI#xscd(/type(Items)/item/USPrice)
schema-URI#xscd(/comment)
schema-URI#xscd(/type(Items)/item/shipDate)

The W3C XQuery and XSLT Working Groups have 
updated five working drafts: </p>

<ul> <li><a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-xpath-datamodel-20040723/">
XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0 Data Model</a> </li>
<li><a

<li><a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-xslt-xquery-serialization-20040723/">XSLT 2.0 and XQuery 1.0 Serialization</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Changes in XPath 2.0 include:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> <code>xdt:untypedAny</code> has been renamed
<code>xdt:untyped</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Value comparisons now return <code>()</code> if either operand is <code>()</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The precedence of the <code>cast</code> and <code>treat</code> operators in the grammar has been increased.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The precedence of unary arithmetic operators has been increased.</p>
</li>
<li class="xpath">
<p>A new component has been added to the static context: context item static type.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The specification now clearly distinguishes between
"statically-known namespaces" (a static property of an expression) and
"in-scope namespaces" (a dynamic property of an element).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>XPath allows host languages to specify whether they recognize the
concept of a namespace node. XQuery does not recognize namespace nodes.
Instead, it recognizes an "in-scope namespaces" property of an element
node.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Changes in XQuery include:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>An <code>ordering</code> declaration has been added to the Prolog, which affects the ordering semantics of path expressions, FLWOR expressions, and <code>union</code>, <code>intersect</code>, and <code>except</code> expressions. In addition, <code>ordered</code> and <code>unordered</code> operators have been introduced that permit ordering semantics to be controlled at the expression level within a query.</p>

</li>

<li >
<p>Validation has been separated from construction. Validation now occurs only as a result of an explicit <code>validate</code> expression. Validation modes are <code>strict</code> and <code>lax</code>, and are specified on the <code>validate</code> expression. New construction modes <code>strip</code> and <code>preserve</code>
have been defined and are declared in the Prolog. The notion of
"validation context" has been deleted. The XQuery definition of
validation has been converged with the definition used in XSLT.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>User defined function overloading: that is, multiple user-defined functions can have the
same name as long as they have different numbers of arguments.</p>
</li>

<li >
<p>Computed namespace constructors are now completely static and are
allowed only inside a computed element constructor. Namespace
declarations in a computed element constructor must come before the
element content, and must consist entirely of literals. The namespace
prefix is optional. If absent, it has the effect of setting the default
namespace for elements and types within the scope of the constructed
element.</p>

</li>

<li>
<p>The precedence of the <code>cast</code> and <code>treat</code> operators  has increased.</p>

</li>

<li>
<p>The precedence of unary arithmetic operators has increased.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Variable initialization in the Prolog now uses an assignment operator ("<code>:=</code>"). Also, circularities in variable initialization are now considered to be a static errors.</p>
</li>

<li >
<p>Module imports and schema imports now accept multiple location
hints, representing multiple physical resources in the same module or
schema.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>CData Sections are no longer considered to be constructors, but are
simply a notational convenience for embedding special characters in the
content of an element or attribute constructor.</p>
</li>

<li >
<p>Three new components have been added to the static context: XQuery
Flagger status, XQuery Static Flagger status, and context item static
type.</p>
</li>

<li >
<p>An <code>order by</code> clause may now accept values of mixed type
if they have a common type that is reachable by numeric promotion
and/or moving up the type derivation hierarchy, and if this common type
has a <code>gt</code> operator.</p>
</li>

<li >
<p>In element and document node constructors, if the content sequence
contains a document node, that node is replaced by its children (this
was previously treated as an error).</p>
</li>

<li >
<p>It is now implementation-defined whether undeclaration of namespace
prefixes in an element constructor is supported. If supported, this
feature conforms to the semantics of Namespaces 1.1. In other words, if
an element constructor binds a namespace prefix to the zero-length
string, any binding of that prefix defined at an outer level is
suspended within the scope of the constructed element.</p>
</li>

</ul>

The Apache Web Services Project has posted version 0.3 of <a href="http://ws.apache.org/jaxme/">JaxMe 2</a>,
an open source implementation of the Java API for XML Binding.
Quoting from the web page,
</p>


<blockquote>
<p>
        JaxMe 2 is an open source implementation of
        <a href="http://java.sun.com/xml/jaxb/"><span class="codefrag">JAXB</span></a>, the specification for
        Java/XML binding. 
      </p>

      <p>A Java/XML binding compiler takes as input a schema
        description (in most cases an XML schema but it may be a DTD, a
        RelaxNG schema, a Java class inspected via reflection or a database
        schema). The output is a set of Java classes:
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A Java bean class compatible with the schema description. (If the schema was
            obtained via Java reflection, then the original Java bean class.)</li>
          <li>An unmarshaller that converts a conforming XML document into the equivalent Java bean.</li>
          <li>Vice versa, a marshaller that converts the Java bean back into the original XML document.</li>
        </ul>
      <p>

        In the case of JaxMe, the generated classes may also
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Store the Java bean into a database. Preferrably an XML database like
            <a href="http://exist.sf.net/"><span class="codefrag">eXist</span></a>,
            <a href="http://xml.apache.org/xindice/"><span class="codefrag">Xindice</span></a>, or
            <a href="http://www.softwareag.com/tamino/"><span class="codefrag">Tamino</span></a>, but it may also
            be a relational database like <a href="http://www.mysql.com/"><span class="codefrag">MySQL</span></a>.
            (If the schema is sufficiently simple. :-)</li>
          <li>Query the database for bean instances.</li>

          <li>Implement an EJB entity or session bean with the same abilities.</li>
        </ul>
      <p>
        In other words, by simply creating a schema and running the JaxMe binding
        compiler,
        you have automatically generated classes that implement the complete
        workflow of a typical web application:</p>

The W3C  Semantic Web Best Practices and Deployment Working Group
has published two new working drafts,
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-swbp-classes-as-values-20040721/">Representing Classes As Property Values on the Semantic Web</a>
and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-swbp-n-aryRelations-20040721/">Defining N-ary Relations on the Semantic Web: Use With Individuals</a>.
The first "addresses the issue of using classes as property values in OWL. While OWL Full and RDF Schema do not put any restriction on using classes as property values, OWL DL and OWL Lite do not generally allow this use. The only property that can have a class as its value is rdf:type (and its subproperties). The document examines different approaches to representing this ontological pattern in OWL DL and discusses considerations that the users should keep in mind when choosing one of the approaches." The second 
describes how to
handle non-binary relations. "In Semantic Web languages, such as RDF and OWL, a property is a binary relation; that is, it links two individuals or an individual and a value. How do we represent relations among more than two individuals? How do we represent properties of a relation, such as our certainty about it, severity or strength of a relation, relevance of a relation, and so on? The document presents ontology patterns for representing n-ary relations and discusses what users must consider when choosing these patterns."
These are expected to become notes, and are not on the recommendation track.

Haven't we learned by now that programmers should not be managing their own memory?  I know there are perfectly good garbage collection libraries for C++. Are there any for plain vanilla C?
 Genx is  published under the expat license.  This is a very liberal, non-viral but GPL-compatible license.

and lots of other crunchy XML goodness. However, XLink is not yet
included and may never be. (The HTML Working Group are extreme
XLink skeptics.) "This version includes an early implementation
of XHTML 2.0 in RELAX NG [RELAXNG], but does not include the
implementations in DTD or XML Schema form." (It's interesting
that even the W3C working groups are starting to prefer RELAX
NG.) This release adds: </p>

I've posted the fourth alpha release of <a href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/XOM/">XOM 1.0</a>, my free-as-in-speech library for processing XML with Java. 
While there are still some flaky parts in the internals to be worked out in the next release &mdash; there's a nasty bug involving <code>FIXED</code> default attribute values in the internal DTD subset, and 
the XSLT processing is not completely compatible with the latest versions of Xalan &mdash; the API is now considered to be complete and frozen. 
Code you write to XOM today should not require recompilation against any future 1.x release, and if a really major  flaw is discovered in the API design, I'll try to provide a deprecation cycle first before removing the flawed methods. 
The API has not changed in a backwards incompatible way
since 1.0d25. All code that ran 
with 1.0d25 should not require recompilation to work with 1.0a1.  
Internal and backwards compatible changes since alpha 1 include:
</p>

  <ul>
	<li>   <code>Nodes.remove(int)</code> now returns the node removed.</li>
   
	<li>   The IBM virtual machine 1.4.1 is no longer special cased.</li>
   
	<li>   The API documentation has undergone extensive editing.</li>
   
	<li>    The unpublished <code>nu.xom.xerces</code> package has been removed.</li>
    
	<li>    Most methods have been made non-recursive, so they shouldn't cause stack overflows in deep documents. </li>

	<li>The W3C XML Schema Language and WML and HTML DOMs have been removed from the bundled version of Xerces to save space.</li>

	<li>    XOM now uses character references only when necessary for all encodings supported by the local virtual machine. However, this may be quite a bit slower than the explicitly supported encodings like UTF-8 and the ISO-8859 character sets. Measurements remain to be performed.</li>

	<li>URI verification and base URI resolution are now performed according to the RFC2396bis algorithm, rather than by using the Xerces and java.net URI classes.</li>

	<li>    The <code>Builder</code> class no longer sets any Java system properties for improved compatibility with applets and multiclassloader environments.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I plan one more alpha release to fix the bugs with XSLT processing and <code>FIXED ATTLIST</code> declarations, and then it's on to beta. The beta releases will be pretty much feature complete and bug free, and focus mostly on finishing
the documentation.

The W3C XML Schema Working Group has posted the first public drafts of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-xmlschema11-1-20040716/">XML Schema 1.1 Part 1: Structures</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-xmlschema11-2-20040716/">XML Schema 1.1 Part 2: Datatypes</a>. According to the introduction to the structures spec,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The Working Group has two main goals for this version of W3C XML Schema:</p><ul><li>Significant improvements in simplicity of design and clarity of
   exposition <em>without</em> loss of backward <em>or</em> forward compatibility;

 </li><li>Provision of support for versioning of XML languages defined using
   the XML Schema specification, including the XML transfer syntax for
   schemas itself.</li></ul><p>These goals are slightly in tension with one another -- the following
summarizes the Working Group's strategic guidelines for changes
between versions 1.0 and 1.1:</p><ol class="enumar"><li>Add support for versioning (acknowledging that this <em>may</em>

    be slightly disruptive to the XML transfer syntax at the margins)</li><li>Allow bug fixes (unless in specific cases we decide that the fix
    is too disruptive for a point release)</li><li>Allow editorial changes</li><li>Allow design cleanup to change behavior in edge cases</li><li>Allow relatively non-disruptive changes to type hierarchy (to
    better support current and forthcoming international standards and
W3C recommendations)</li><li>Allow design cleanup to change component structure (changes
    to functionality restricted to edge cases)</li><li>Do not allow any significant changes in functionality</li><li>Do not allow any changes to XML transfer syntax except those
    required by version control hooks and bug fixes</li></ol><p>The overall aim as regards compatibility is that</p><ul><li>All schema documents conformant to version 1.0 of this
    specification should also conform to version 1.1, and should have
    the same validation behaviour across 1.0 and 1.1 implementations
    (except possibly in edge cases and in the details of the resulting
    PSVI);</li><li>The vast majority of schema documents conformant to version 1.1 of
    this specification should also conform to version 1.0, leaving
    aside any incompatibilities arising from support for versioning,
    and when they are conformant to version 1.0 (or are made
    conformant by the removal of versioning information), should have
    the same validation behaviour across 1.0 and 1.1 implementations
    (again except possibly in edge cases and in the details of the
    resulting PSVI);</li></ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
Changes in the data type spec include:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Distinction between identity and equality; for instance positive and negative zero would be equal but not identical. Think of the difference between <code>==</code> and <code>equals()</code> in Java. </li>
<li>New <code>yearMonthDuration</code> and <code>dayTimeDuration</code> types</li>
<li>A <code>precisionDecimal</code> type</li>
</ul>

<p>
There are also numerous open issues including how to align the W3C XML schema language with XML 1.1
and whether to allow a year 0.

The <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=xslt">OASIS XSLT Conformance Working Group</a>
finally noticed that their test suite didn't actually contain
any expected output, which rendered the entire suite pretty much useless.
They never bothered to acknowledge or respond to my repeated queries on this
issue, but the Mozilla Project managed 
<a href="http://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/xslt-conformance/200407/msg00004.html">to get 
their attention</a>
on this matter. They've posted a <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/documents.php?wg_abbrev=xslt">new version of the 
test suite</a> that includes the expected output for the first time.
However, it seems the catalog is still out of sync with the actual output files.
That is, the catalog says you'll find the output somewhere like attribset/attribset01.out
but you'll actually find it in REF_OUT/attribset/attribset01.out. 
And there are some tests like boolean_bool15, extend_ac137.xsl, namespace_nspc05,
namespace_nspc24, expression_expr04, processorinfo_prop03, 
and most of the Xalan output and string test cases
where the file names given in the catalog
don't match the file names you'll find in the directories.
There's at least one test case, mdocs_mdocsxxx, where either the files are
missing or the test was never written or finished. 
Some of the Xalan string tests cases found in the archive aren't actually referenced in the catalog
(numbers 31 to 36).
I'd report the bugs directly to the working group,
but based on past experience using their
<a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/comments/form.php?wg_abbrev=xslt">online form</a>
or posting to the <a href="http://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/xslt-conformance/">mailing list</a> 
appears to drop the message into a black hole
where it's never heard from again. I figure if I post it here, there's at least some
chance someone in the working group might see it. 
Still, despite the bugs, I'm glad to see  test suite is moving forward again.
For a long time, I was afraid they'd given up.

The W3C XML Schema Working Group has published an updated
 working draft of 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-xmlschema-ref-20040716/">XML Schema: Component Designators</a>.
This spec proposes a scheme for naming and 
identifying  XML Schema
components. Such  components include: </p>

<ul> <li>Simple and complex type definitions</li>
<li>Attribute
declarations</li>
<li>Element declarations</li>
<li>Attribute and
model group definitions</li>
<li>Identity-constraint
definitions</li>
<li>Notation declarations</li>
<li>Annotations</li>
<li>Model groups</li>
<li>Particles</li>
<li>Wildcards</li>
<li>Attribute uses</li>
<li>The master schema
component representing the schema as a whole.</li>
<li>Facets</li> </ul>

<p> The goal is to be able to name, for example, the
literallayout notation in the DocBook schema, as well as every
other significant piece of the schema. These names could then be used as fragment identifiers in URI references that point to schemas. The draft gives these examples of the current syntax proposal:
 </p>


<pre>schema-URI#xscd(/type(Items))
schema-URI#xscd(/type(Items)/item)
schema-URI#xscd(/type(Items)/item/type())
schema-URI#xscd(/type(Items)/item/productName)
schema-URI#xscd(/type(Items)/item/quantity)
schema-URI#xscd(/type(Items)/item/quantity/type())
schema-URI#xscd(/type(Items)/item/quantity/type()/facet(maxExclusive))
schema-URI#xscd(/type(Items)/item/USPrice)
schema-URI#xscd(/comment)
schema-URI#xscd(/type(Items)/item/shipDate)
schema-URI#xscd(/type(Items)/item/@partNum)

OpenOffice.org has posted 
<a href="http://download.openoffice.org/680/index.html">snapshot m47</a> of OpenOffice 2.0, the open source word processor/spreadsheet/drawing program/presentation software that saves all its documents in zipped XML. 
"This snapshot identifies itself for the first time as 1.9.x to indicate that 2.0 release is not that far away." Among other new features in 2.0, HTML export should now produce 
valid 'XHTML 1.0 Strict' documents, and XHTML export will be enabled for 
 Calc, Draw and Impress as well as Writer. 
Furthermore, 
"The expert user should be able to install XSLT-based input/output filters for StarOffice/OpenOffice.org. The average user should be able to use them seamlessly. For OOo2.0, XSL-transformations are also supported for the modules Writer/Web, Master Document, and Math."
It's not immediately clear if this is true in the current milestone, however.  Other new features include Word Count in selections,
nested tables, and improved compatibility with Microsoft Office. 
So far only an English build is available though localized versions will be added closer to release.

 has now been ported to  Mac OS X.
This is still based on X11 rather than Aqua, and I haven't tested it myself yet, but I'm told it's a major step forward in usability on the Mac. The press release claims, 
"This
release has attained a maturity that enables it to be used as the
default productivity suite by individuals and organizations alike.
Not only is the release significantly faster and more robust than early
versions, and available in numerous languages, but fonts are smooth, and
overall integration into the Mac OS X desktop has been enhanced.  For
instance, there is clipboard functionality and, through a helper
application, OpenOffice.org documents can be opened in OpenOffice.org
1.1.2 the usual Mac way, by double clicking on them."
They're still <a href="http://porting.openoffice.org/mac/">looking</a> for experienced Mac developers to help them port this to Aqua.

After a two-year absence, Yuval Oren has resurfaced and
released <a href="http://piccolo.sourceforge.net/">Piccolo 1.0.4</a>, a non-validating, open source  SAX parser written in Java.
In my initial tests, this version is 
much improved over 1.0.3 although there are still a few bugs where the wrong exception is thrown or ID and IDREF type attributes aren't normalized properly. I need to update and rerun my SAX conformance tests.
The GNU JAXP folks have raised a couple of issues with some of the test cases out on the corners, so I'll need to fix those first.
But in the meantime,
I plugged Piccolo into XOM's unit test suite
(all of which passes with Xerces 2.6.1 under JDK 1.4.2_02 on Linux) and there were 18 test failures. Still, that's a lot better than it did before. 
Besides bug fixes, this release changes the license fron LGPL to Apache License 2.0.

<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-xmlquery-full-text-use-cases-20040709/">XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0 Full-Text Use Cases</a>
and posted the first public working draft of 
 <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-xquery-full-text-20040709/">XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0 Full-Text</a>. According to the latter,
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>XML documents may contain highly-structured data (numbers,
dates), unstructured data (untagged free-flowing text), and
semi-structured data (text with embedded tags). Where a document
contains unstructured or semi-structured data, it is important to be
able to search that data using Information Retrieval techniques such as
full-text search. Full-text search is different from substring search
in many ways:</p>
<ol class="enumar">
<li>
<p>A full-text search searches for phrases (a sequence of words) rather
than substrings. A substring search for news items that contain the
string "lease" will return a news item that contains "Foobar
Corporation releases the 20.9 version ...". A full-text search for the
phrase "lease" will not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is an expectation that a full-text search will support
language- and token-based searches which substring search cannot. An
example of a language-based search is "find me all the news items that
contain a word with the same linguistic stem as "mouse" (finds "mouse"
and "mice"). An example of a token-based search is "find me all the
news items that contain the word "XML" within 3 words (tokens) of
"Query".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Full-text search is subject to the vageries and nuances of language.
The results it returns are often of varying usefulness. When you search
a web site for all cameras that cost less than $100, this is an exact
search. There is a set of cameras that match this search, and a set
that do not. Similarly, when you do a string search across news items
for "mouse", there is only 1 expected result set. When you do a
full-text search for, say, all the news items that contain the word
"mouse", you probably expect to find news items with the word "mice",
and possibly "rodents" (or possibly "computers"!). But not all results
are equal : some results are more "mousey" than others. Because
full-text search can be inexact, we have the notion of score or
relevance : we generally expect to see the most relevant results at the
top of the results list. Of course, relevance is in the eye of the
beholder. Note: as XQuery/XPath evolves, it may apply the notion of
score to querying structured search. For example, when making travel
plans or shopping for cameras, it is sometimes more useful to get an
ordered list of near-matches. If XQuery/XPath defines a generalized
inexact match, we assume that XQuery/XPath can utilize the scoring
framework provided by the full-text language.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>As XML becomes mainstream, users expect to be able to store and
search all their documents in XML. This requires a standard way to do
full-text search, as well as structured searches, against XML
documents. A similar requirement for full-text search led ISO to define
the SQL/MM-FT standard. SQL/MM-FT defines extensions to SQL to express
full-text queries providing similar functionality as this full-text
language extension to XQuery 1.0/XPath 2.0 does.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Full-text queries are performed on text which has been tokenized,
i.e., broken into a sequence of words, units of punctuation, and spaces.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A word is defined as any character, n-gram, or sequence of
characters returned by a tokenizer as a basic unit to be queried. Each
instance of a word consists of one or more consecutive characters.
Beyond that, words are implementation defined. Note that consecutive
words need not be separated by either punctuation or space, and words
may overlap. A phrase is a sequence of ordered words which can contain
any number of words.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tokenization enables functions and operators which work with the
relative positions of words (e.g., proximity operators). It also
uniquely identifies sentences and paragraphs in which words appear.
Tokenization also enables functions and operators which operate on a
part or the root of the word (e.g., wildcards, stemming).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>We use the namespace "ft" (for full-text) that corresponds to the
URL http://www.w3.org/2004/07/xquery-full-text and defines the
namespace of full-text search. We also use "fts" for definitional
purposes in <a href="#tq-semantics">semantics Section</a>.</p>

The W3C Technical Architecture Group (TAG) has updated the working draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-webarch-20040705/">Architecture of the World Wide Web, First Edition</a>. "Web architecture includes the definition of the information space in terms of identification and representation of its contents, and of the protocols that support the interaction of agents in an information system making use of the space. Web architecture is influenced by social requirements and software engineering <strong>principles</strong>. These lead to design choices and <strong>constraints</strong> on the behavior of systems that use the Web in order to achieve desired properties of the shared information space: efficiency, scalability, and the potential for indefinite growth across languages, cultures, and media. <strong>Good practice</strong> by agents in the system is also important to the success of the system. This document reflects the three bases of Web architecture: identification, interaction, and representation."

I think I've got the various servlets on elharo.com that drive the Fibonacci web services used as examples in <a href="books/xmljava/">Processing XML with Java</a>
running again. They went down a few months ago when security issues necessitated switching the server from Red Hat to a supported distribution. If you weren't able to connect over the last few months, please try them again and let me know if they work for you.
</p>

<p>
I'm now using Apache 2.0 and Tomcat 5. Tomcat 5 is a definite improvement over Tomcat 4 in several ways. It was much easier to install the servlets than it had ever been before. I just uploaded a .war file through a web interface and they worked immediately. However,
the connection between Tomcat and Apache is still painful to set up, and the documentation ranges from poor to actively misleading. 
The Apache Project has a nasty habit of not considering decent documentation to be a prerequisite for a release.

Once again, I'll be chairing the XML track for
Software Development 2005 West in Santa Clara next March.
 The <a href="http://www.cmpevents.com/SDw5/a.asp?option=N">Call for Proposals</a> for is now live.
Besides XML, tracks include Web Services, Java, Emerging Technologies, C++, Requirements &amp; Analysis, 
.NET, and Mobile Development.
 Plus we have two new tracks this year: System Security and Scripting. 
 Most sessions are 90 minute classes, but we also have room for half and full-day tutorials (I prefer half-day tutorials in the XML track), Birds-of-a-feather sessions, and panels. 
Submissions are due by August 6th.
</p>

<p>
For the XML track, we're interested in practical sessions 
 covering all aspects of XML. This is not specifically an XML show, so we tend to find that our audience responds better to more practical, how-to, basic sessions as opposed to more theoretical, high-level sessions.
For instance, a simple introduction to XQuery would go over better than 
a detailed comparison of XQuery optimization techniques. 
One thing previous attendees have told us is that they'd like to see more new sessions at each show, so we're going to be looking preferentially 
for talks that have not previously been given at SD West.

XimpleWare has posted  <a href="http://vtd-xml.sf.net">VTD-XML 0.5</a>, a free (GPL) 
<a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/05/19/parsing.html">non-extractive</a> Java library for  processing XML.
 According to the announcement,
 </p>
 
 <blockquote>
<p>
 Capable of random-access, VTD-XML attempts to be both memory
efficient and high performance. The starting point of this project is
the observation that, for XML documents that don't declare entities
in DTD, tokenization can indeed be done by only recording the starting
offset and length of a token.
</p>
 
<p>
  The core technology of VTD-XML is a binary format specification
called Virtual Token Descriptor (VTD). A VTD record is a 64-bit integer
that encodes the starting offset, length, type and nesting depth of a
token in an XML document.  Because VTD records don't contain actually
token content, they work alongside of the original XML document, which
is maintained intact in memory by the processing model.
</p>
 
<p>
  VTD's memory-conserving features can be summarized as follows:
</p>
 <ul>

	<li>Avoid Per-object overhead  -- In many VM-based object-oriented programming languages, per-object allocation incurs a small amount of memory overhead. A VTD record is immune to the overhead because it is not an object.</li>

	<li>Bulk-allocation of storage -- Fixed in length, VTD records can be stored in large memory blocks, which are more efficient to allocate and GC. By allocating a large array for 4096 VTD records, one incurs the per-array overhead (16 bytes in JDK 1.4) only once across 4096 records, thus reducing per-record overhead to very little.</li>
</ul>
 
 <p>
 Our benchmark indicates that VTD-XML processes XML at the performance
level similar to (and often better than) SAX with NULL content handler.
The memory usage is typically between 1.3x ~ 1.6x of the size of the
document, with "1" being the document itself.
</p>
 
<p>
  Other features included in this release are:
</p>
 <ul>

	<li>Incremental update -- VTD-XML allows one to modify content of XML without touching irrelevant parts of the document.</li>

	<li>Content extraction -- VTD-XML also allows one to pull an element out of XML in its serialized format. This can be an important feature for partial signing/encryption of SOAP payload for WS-security.</li>
</ul>

 
 <p>
 In the upcoming releases, we plan to add the persistence support so
that one can save/load VTD to/from the disk along with the XML documents
to avoid repetitive parsing in read-only situations. XPATH support is
also on the development roadmap. However, we would like to collect as
many suggestions and bug reports before taking the next step.
</p>
 
</blockquote>

<p>
The algorithms sound interesting. Unfortunately VTD-XML
 cannot process arbitrary XML, at least not yet. 
First off, it
places some arbitrary limits on the size of qualified names and of the entire document, though this would seem to be fixable.
The size of the qualified names could easily be run up to as much as is supported by a Java String, which is all competing APIs can claim.
The limits on document size may be fundamental, but they are 
at least competitive with other in-memory APIs like DOM, though not with streaming APIs like SAX and StAX. 
Bigger problems include entity resolution, default attribute values, and attribute value normalization.
VTD-XML does not support entity references other than five predefined entities (<code>&amp;amp;</code> <code>&amp;lt;</code>, etc.).
The documentation doesn't discuss default attributes or
attribute value normalization, but given the algorithms used these seem unlikely to be supported.
More than once I've seen completing the last 10% of XML conformance
 demolish the speed that was so impressive in earlier, less complete 
 betas. :-( It remains to be seen whether XimpleWare can extend their algorithms to support XML in all its complexity.

dom4j is based on interfaces rather than classes, which distinguishes it from alternatives like JDOM and XOM (Not to its credit, in my opinion. Using concrete classes instead of interfaces was one of the crucial 
decisions that made JDOM as simple as it is.) Version 1.5 seems to be mostly a collection of bug fixes and small, backwards compatible, API
enhancements.

replace them without having to use endorsed directories, -Xbootclasspath, and other CLASSPATH-fu.

</p>

<p>
This whole spec is based on a very outmoded and discredited W3C XML Schema-centric view of the world. Most laughable line: 
"Any nontrivial application of XML will, then, be based upon one or more
schemas and will involve one or more programs that create, consume, and
manipulate documents whose syntax and semantics are governed by those
schemas;" and by "schemas" they really do mean W3C XML Schema Language schemas exclusively.  Hmm, I guess XSLT, DocBook, OpenOffice, and RSS are all trivial, then?  But really, this spec gets things monstrously wrong in almost every paragraph. I don't think the authors have any clue just how myopic their view of XML really is.

The W3C XML Protocol Working Group has published several working drafts releating to XML-binary Optimized Packaging (XOP).
The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-xop10-20040608/">XML-binary Optimized Packaging</a> spec defines a new XOP Infoset 
(which is not an XML Infoset) based on a XOP document (which is not an XML document).
A XOP document is a MIME multipart document containing a single XML document and lots of unparsed binary data in the other MIME parts. 
The XML document contains <code>xop:Include</code> elements 
that point to the binary data. The XOP document can be converted to an XML document by extracting the main XML document from the MIME document and then 
replacing all the <code>xop:Include</code> elements with the Base-64 encoded versions of the binary data they point to. 
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-soap12-rep-20040608/">SOAP Resource Representation Header</a> "describes the semantics and serialization of a SOAP header block for carrying resource representations in SOAP messages." This defines elements that hold a Base-64 encoded picture, MPEG file, plain text file, database, or just about anything else from a particular URL, and then stuffing that in a SOAP header. In practice, this would not actually be Base-64 encoded. 
The data would be replaced by a <code>xop:Include</code> element 
that contains a copy of the original binary data. This way a client could receive a collection of interlinked resources as a single SOAP message. 
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-xml-media-types-20040608/">Assigning Media Types to Binary Data in XML</a> attempts to make sure the MIME media types of all this binary data flying around doesn't get lost when the XOP document is transmitted, stored, or serialized. To this end, it 
defines a <code>contentType</code> attribute for  indicating  
the media type of XML element content whose type is <code>xs:base64Binary</code>. It also defines an <code>expectedMediaType</code> for use in schema annotations
to indicate what the <code>contentType</code> attribute may say.

A few other specs try to explain how all this fits together and justify thw work  to skeptics.
(The working group has up till now done a notoriously poor job of communicating what they're up to, thereby 
engendering much hostility
from other groups and people 
that don't really disagree with them in any fundamental way.) 
A <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/NOTE-xopinc-FAQ-20040608/">new FAQ list</a> attempts to answer some frequently asked questions about all this, but it's rather poorly written and makes several obvious mistakes so it probably won't help matters any.
The other specs in this family seem to be written more carefully and correctly. 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-soap12-mtom-20040608/">SOAP Message Transmission Optimization Mechanism</a> describes how these different technologies work together, and 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-soap12-os-ucr-20040608/">SOAP Optimized Serialization Use Cases and Requirements</a> explains just why the W3C XML Protocol Working Group thinks this is so important.

<a href="http://www.elharo.com/">www.elharo.com</a> is back up after a  three-month absence. I still need to set up the virtual hosts on that server (macfaq.com, namespaces.cafeconleche.org, xom.nu), get the servlets working, and update the page itself; but overall this seems to be going a lot more smoothly than my experiences with Linux in the past. 
This time I installed Debian. Apt is a very nice program, but what really makes a difference seems to be installing a bare minimum  of functionality and adding the rest one package at a time as I need it.
Debian's bare minimum is still too maxxed out for my tastes. For instance, "vacation" is hardly an essential package. (I removed it.) I also manually installed the key programs I wanted on the server past the minimum: Apache, Tomcat 5, JDK, etc. This way I have a lot more control over what's running and how it's configured than I did by installing distro packages.
</p>


<p>
I reiterate my call for distro vendors to stop competing by seeing how much junk they can squeeze onto a CD, or now a DVD. 
I suggest they carefully select the packages they include, and hew to the maxim, "Less is more." One GUI toolkit, not two. One kernel, not three. One window manager, not seven. One text editor, not seventeen. No servers running by default. No office suites. No games or graphics editors. 
Do make it easy for users to install extra functionality they happen to want.
(Apt seems to do this quite well.)
However, installing everything any user might ever need 
does not accomplish this.

The W3C Device Independence Working Group has posted the first public working draft of  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-cselection-20040611/">Content Selection for Device Independence (DISelect) 1.0</a>. According to the abstract, "This document specifies a syntax and processing model general purpose selection. Selection involves conditional processing of various parts of an XML information set according to the results of the evaluation of expressions. Using this mechanism some parts of the information set can be selected for further processing and others can be suppressed. The specification of the parts of the infoset affected and the expressions that govern processing is by means of XML-friendly syntax. This includes elements, attributes and XPath expressions. This document specifies how these components work together to provide general purpose selection."
</p>


<p> 
That sounds unobjectionable, but what the working group is 
really proposing  is XML markup that can be added to a page to indicate which devices certain content is appropriate for. For example, this <code>sel:if</code> element says that the image should only be displayed if the user's device supports color or has a window size wider than 500 pixels. 
</p>

<pre><code>&lt;sel:if sel:expr="dc:cssmq-width('px') &amp;gt; 500" 
    &amp; dc:cssmq-color() &gt; 0" >
  &lt;object src="picture.png"/&gt;
&lt;/sel:select> </code></pre>

<p>
This feels more than a little like presentation based markup. 
This is very much like using JavaScript or server side programs to identify different browsers and send them content tailored specifically to them.  This syntax  is definitely easier-to-use, and more powerful  than the various JavaScript and server-side hacks people use today; but should we be doing this at all? 
Wahtever happened to the vision of sending browsers XML documents with appropriate stylesheets and letting the client decide how to best present it? The thing that bothers me the most about this proposal is that the syntax mixes the presentation information straight into the document, rather than linking to it from a separate hints sheet. In many ways, this document seems to reflect a belief that the the W3C has been going down the wrong road for the last eight years in attempting to separate content from presentation.

<p>
I'm pleased to announce the first alpha of <a href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/XOM/">XOM 1.0</a>, my free-as-in-speech library for processing XML with Java. My definition of alpha is a lot stricter than most people's. While there are still some flaky parts in the internals to be worked out &mdash; the internal URI parsing is a complete hack, and I'd like to remove recursion from the last few methods where it occurs to avoid potential stack overflows in very deep documents &mdash; but the API is now considered to be complete and frozen. 
Code you write to XOM today should not require recompilation against any future 1.x release, and if a really major  flaw is discovered in the API design, I'll try to provide a deprecation cycle first before removing the flawed methods. 
</p>




<p>
The API has changed not at all since 1.0d25. All code that ran 
with 1.0d25 should not require recompilation to work with 1.0a1.  
Internal changes include:
</p>

  <ul>
	<li> Support for the 2nd candidate recommendation of XInclude; including preservation of <code>xml:lang</code> values</li>
    
	<li>    The base URI handling has been modified as follows:

        <ol>
	<li> <code>getBaseURI()</code> always returns an absolute URI or the empty string if the base URI is not known. Other than the empty string it never returns a relative URI. It never returns null.</li>
	<li> The actual base URI of an element does not change when it is detached or copied, unless affected by a different set of <code>xml:base</code> attributes.</li>
	<li> The <code>setBaseURI()</code> method only accepts an absolute URI. It throws a MalformedURIException if you attempt to pass it a relative URI, or a URI with a fragment identifier. (Relative URIs are still allowed in <code>xml:base</code> attributes.)</li>
   
</ol>

   </li>
   </ul>

   <p>
   In addition several  bugs have been fixed and some operations have been sped up. Bradley Huffman is pushing back on the design of the base URI handling, but this is just a really ugly, nasty part of the XML world; and XOM can't help but reflect some of that ugliness. The Infoset, URI,  and XML Base specifications  really don't say how to handle parts of documents that don't have base URIs. Trying to make this work in a sensible way is like trying to push a bubble out of wall-to-wall carpet. Anywhere I fix the problem, it pops up somewhere else. I tried to push the base URI bubble into the least apparent place I could find, and there I think it's going to stay.

 various syndication formats including RSS 0.90, 0.91, 0.92, 0.93, 0.94, 1.0, and 2.0 and Atom 0.3. 
 "The parsers can give you back Java objects that are either specific for the format you want to work with, or a generic normalized SyndFeed object that lets you work on with the data without bothering about the underlying format.
Rome is called like this because all feeds lead to Rome." 
It's not immediately clear if Rome will wo rwill not handle malformed feeds, but since Rome is based on JDOM and Xerces I suspect not.

IBM's alphaWorks has released 
<a href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/styler">Stylesheet Splicer</a>,  a customizable XSLT processor for Windows that 
can manage  multiple versions of XSL stylesheets from a common code base. 
</p>

<blockquote>
A single XSL stylesheet, with a stylesheet processor such as Stylesheet Splicer, will transform a source XML document from one format (such as ColdFusion CFXML) into a target XML document of another format (such as Rosetta PIP). Usually nodes and values not present in the source document are added. When a variety of target documents is required, a number of different stylesheets are usually prepared with extensive duplication among them. With Stylesheet Splicer, multiple stylesheets may be segmented into their unique component parts, without duplication, and assembled dynamically for the particular target variation desired. Stylesheet Splicer implements a simple preprocessor language to control the mixing and matching of XSLT fragments and also to create run-time pop-up windows, allowing users to enter XSLT parameter values needed in the transformation.

 The RDF Data Access Working Group has published the first public working draft of 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-rdf-dawg-uc-20040602/">RDF Data Access Use Cases and Requirements</a>.
According to the introduction,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The W3C's Semantic Web Activity is based on RDF's flexibility as a means of representing data. While there are several standards covering RDF itself, there has not yet been any work done to create standards for querying or accessing RDF data. There is no formal, publicly standardized language for querying RDF information. Likewise, there is no formal, publicly standardized data access protocol for interacting with remote or local RDF storage servers.
</p>

<p>
Despite the lack of standards, developers in commercial and in open source projects have created many query languages for RDF data. But these languages lack both a common syntax and a common semantics. In fact, the extant query languages cover a significant semantic range: from declarative, SQL-like languages, to path languages, to rule or production-like systems. The existing languages also exhibit a range of extensibility features and built-in capabilities, including inferencing and distributed query.
</p>

<p>
Further, there may be as many different methods of accessing remote RDF storage servers as there are distinct RDF storage server projects. Even where the basic access protocol is standardized in some senseâHTTP, SOAP, or XML-RPCâthere is little common ground upon which to develop generic client support to access a wide variety of such servers.
</p>

<p>
The following use cases characterize some of the most important and most common motivations behind the development of existing RDF query languages and access protocols. The use cases, in turn, inform decisions about requirements, that is, the critical features that a standard RDF query language and data access protocol require, as well as design objectives that aren't on the critical path.
</p>

The IETF has posted a new working draft of 
             <a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-duerst-iri-08.txt">Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs)</a>.
"An IRI is a sequence of characters from the
   Universal Character Set (Unicode/ISO 10646). A mapping from IRIs to
   URIs is defined, which means that IRIs can be used instead of URIs
   where appropriate to identify resources." In other words this lets you write URLs that use non-ASCII characters such as 
http://www.libÃ©ration.fr/. The non-ASCII characters would be converted to a genuine URI using hexadecimally escaped UTF-8. For instance,
http://www.libÃ©ration.fr/ becomes http://www.lib%C3%A9ration.fr/.
There's also an alternative, more complicated  syntax to be used when the DNS doesn't allow
percent escaped domain names. However, the other parts of the IRI (fragment ID, path, scheme, etc.) always use percent escaping.

The Multimodal Interaction Framework separates multimodal systems into a set of functional units, including Input and Output components, an Interaction Mananger, Session Components, System and Environment, and Application Functions. In order for those functional components to interact with each other to form an application interpreter, the browser implementation must allow for communication and coordination between those components. This DOM interface identifies the DOM APIs used to communicate and coordinate at the browser implemention level. Multimodal 
browsers can be stand-alone or distributed systems.

Yesterday I wrote about what I didn't like at WWW2004 (the Semantic Web).
Today I'm going to write about what I did like, because there was one technology presented that really impressed me, and that I think is going to be a key part of development in the very near future, with an exponential growth rate for the next couple of years. That technology is XForms. 
</p>

<p>
Like many successful technologies before it (XML, HTML, Java, Linux), XForms doesn't really let you do anything you can't do today. It is not radically new. It does not require reorganizing the way one  runs a business or develops software. 
Unlike the semantic web, it does not require learning completely new and unfamiliar areas of technology such as ontologies and inference systems. 
What XForms does do is give developers the tools to write a lot of the applications they're already writing today much more quickly, cleanly, and robustly. 
</p>

<p>
I'm still learning about XForms, but what I see impresses me a lot.
They are much better designed than HTML forms ever were. They have been designed with usability, accessibility, and internationalization in mind
(not that any of those features ever really sell development tools, but they're nice to have when they don't cost you anything more). More importantly for XForms adoption, they lend themselves to the writing of clean, powerful code. Many things programmers really do care about 
like data validation are built right into XForms. Previously these have had to be hacked together with really ugly JavaScript tricks and server side frameworks. More importantly XForms are going to enable really new, server-deployed applications running inside browsers that just can't be handled in HTML.  For instance, one XForm demoed at the conference 
essentially embedded a spreadsheet inside an HTML page. This wasn't done with ActiveX code like in IE.  It was all written with declarative XForms. 
Up till now, browser-based applications have had fairly poor user interfaces limited functionality. XForms changes all that.
You still wouldn't write Photoshop or Quake in XForms, but you certainly can write a lot of business based apps for retail, data entry, customer service, and the like; and this brings me to my next point:
</p>

<p>
I've seen many businesses standardize on IE over the last few years because they like using Microsoft's proprietary technologies for integrating data into their Intranets. 
It's easier to develop a lot of applications by feeding data into grid controls embedded in web pages. They get richer, more powerful user interfaces that work a lot better than anything they can achieve with standard HTML+JavaScript; and they can deploy the app over the network straight into the browser. It's a very cost effective, compelling story
for a shop that's mostly all-Microsoft anyway. But with XForms the development advantage shifts. The same rich interfaces can be prepared with XForms (or XForms+CSS) even faster. The resulting applications will be much more robust, and have naturally greater separation of the data model from the user interface. (Of course, you can separate the data model from the user interface in an IE DOM solution as well, but you have to think about it and work to make it happen. With XForms, by contrast, you'd have to work pretty hard not to separate the model from the user interface.) The benefits are even larger for someone moving from traditional HTML forms+JavaScript, or PHP, or JSP. You'll still be able to use all these technologies, but you'll need to use them a lot less. Much more of the work can be offloaded into the forms themselves, and the data presented to your application in a much richer format than x-www-formurlencoded name=value pairs. XForms won't do everything,
but like XML, they will do a lot more so your application can do less. 
</p>

<p>
There is one big open question about XForms and that's implementation. 
From what I gathered at the conference there's currently exactly one high quality implementation, x-port's <a href="http://www.formsplayer.com/">FormsPlayer</a>, and it isn't open source. Pricing is of the "Call us, and we'll figure out how much we can shake out of you" variety. There's a free-beer version for developers who just want to play with this stuff, but the cost for widespread deployment is too high. There is one open source implementation of the spec, <a href="http://chiba.sourceforge.net/">Chiba</a>, but it isn't complete, and the people who should know at the conference didn't seem too impressed with it. Still, it's at least worth a look, and might be a good investment of time for any programmer with the time to spare and an itch to scratch.  
</p>

<p>
However the holy grail for XForms support is not a browser plug-in like FormsPlayer, a standalone application like
<a href="http://www.xsmiles.org/">X-Smiles</a>, or 
 a Java/JavaScript/servlet hack like IBM's  <a href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/xmlforms">XForms compiler</a>.
Rather it's direct support for XForms built right into the browser.
An organization that installed an XForms aware browser on every user's desktop could thereafter forget about most installation hassles. 
New custom apps could be delivered just by loading the right web page.
I know we've heard this story before, but XForms looks like the technology that could finally deliver it. So, how likely is browser based support for XForms? In IE, not very likely. IE is essentially frozen, and even a few years down the line Microsoft is really focused on its own XAML, likely to the exclusion of competing technologies like XForms. The more likely host is Mozilla. Mozilla doesn't have the market share IE does, especially in business, but that's changing. Real XForms support would give businesses the same ease-of-application-development incentive to make the switch from IE to Mozilla that caused them to move from Netscape to IE several years ago. Mozilla+XForms is a potential IE killer. Unfortunately, this doesn't look likely to happen tomorrow.
The vendors and developers of alternative browsers are <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=97806">showing surprising resistance</a> to XForms. For instance, Opera's Ian Hickson <a href="http://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1085056751&amp;count=1">writes</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
For us (the Web browser vendors: Opera, Mozilla, and Apple), the "backwards compatible" requirement is not really negotiable, because it is quite clear that solutions that don't work in the market leader's browser won't be accepted by mainstream Web developers. I think a lot of people in the W3C world are having difficulty accepting this, especially given that Microsoft have basically said that IE has been end-of-lined (it is my understanding that IE in the next version of Windows will have no changes to its HTML/CSS/DOM/XML implementations and still no support for XHTML, and Microsoft have also stated that there will be no new separately-downloadable versions of IE available anyway, so even if they did upgrade it, it would only be used by those who upgraded their operating system).
</blockquote>

<p>
I think what he misses is that XForms is a compelling enough story to displace IE. Market leaders can be tossed out. IE displaced Navigator, partially because Microsoft had the advantage of bundling IE with Windows, but also because they produced a superior product, at least on some platforms for a few years. It's no longer true that IE is a better browser than Mozilla, Opera, Safari, and other competitors. 
In fact, almost everyone who's tried one or more of the alternatives agrees that Microsoft is falling farther behind every day. Microsoft's decision to halt IE development until Longhorn ships (possibly in 2006, probably later) is a disaster for them. 
If Mozilla implemented XForms quickly, Longhorn would enter a
market in which businesses and developers were already strongly committed to XForms. XAML instead of hitting the market like Visual Basic did 15 years ago, would be more like C#, a day late and a dollar short; a nice idea, but not one that would offer developers anything they didn't already have. 
As Ray Kroc liked to note, and as Bill Gates undoubtedly knows, when you see a competitor drowning, 
shove a fire hose down their throat. IE is drowning. XForms is a nice, big firehose.

<p> Malcolm Wallace and Colin Runciman have released
version 1.12 of <a
href="http://www.haskell.org/HaXml/">HaXml</a>, a bug fix release
of the  XML processing library for the  Haskell language.
According to the web page, </p>

<blockquote> <p> <b>HaXml</b> is a collection of utilities for
using <a href="http://www.haskell.org">Haskell</a> and <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml">XML</a> together.  Its basic
facilities include: </p>

<ul> <li> a parser for XML,</li>
<li> a separate error-correcting
parser for HTML,</li>
<li> an XML validator,</li>
<li>
pretty-printers for XML and HTML.</li> </ul>

<p> For processing XML documents, the following components are
provided: </p> <ul> <li><em>Combinators</em> is a combinator
library for generic XML document processing, including
transformation, editing, and generation.</li>
<li><em>Haskell2Xml</em> is a replacement class for Haskell's
Show/Read classes: it allows you to read and write ordinary
Haskell data as XML documents.  The <em>DrIFT</em> tool
(available from <a
href="http://repetae.net/~john/computer/haskell/DrIFT/">
<tt>http://repetae.net/~john/computer/haskell/DrIFT/</tt></a>)
can automatically derive this class for you.</li>
<li><em>DtdToHaskell</em> is a tool for translating any valid XML
DTD into equivalent Haskell types.</li>

<li>In conjunction with the <em>Xml2Haskell</em> class framework,
this allows you to generate, edit, and transform documents as
normal typed values in programs, and to read and write them as
human-readable XML documents.</li>
<li>Finally, <em>Xtract</em>
is a <em>grep</em>-like tool for XML documents, loosely based on
the XPath and XQL query languages.  It can be used either from
the command-line, or within your own code as part of the
library.</li> </ul> </blockquote>

<p> This release changes the license to LGPL for the libraries
and GPL for the tools. It also fixes bugs.  </p>

<p>
Digesting last week's WWW2004 conference, I think I've come to two conclusions. The first conclusion is that 
the semantic web as envisioned at the W3C (RDF, OWL, URIs) is hype. Nobody is actually using it to accomplish anything useful. It's of great interest to theoreticians but has little to no practical impact, and is not likely to have any for the foreseeable future. I watched a lot of semantic web presentations over four days and they basically divided into two broad types:  
</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>
Discussions of how to search, infer, query, store, manipulate or otherwise process RDF; without actually showing any practical applications. 
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Case studies that sounded good and useful, and indeed were. However, when I actually googled my way into the projects' web sites and looked at the code, the projects proved to be using little to no semantic web technology. A few had <code>rdf:about</code> attributes stuck somewhere in a mass of plain XML. Some didn't even have that. Any semantics these applications had was based purely on element names and namespace URIs. RDF tuples were an afterthought, if indeed they were present at all. 
</p>

</li>

</ul>

<p>
Someone suggested during the lunch discussions at the end of the conference that XML was over; that the XML track had the least attendance and least interest from the attendees. The latter point may be true. The conference was full of academics who've hitched their wagons to the semantic web ox; and most  XML focussed academics go to the IDEAlliance conferences instead of the W3C ones, so the audience in New York was both positively selected for the semantic web and negatively selected for XML. 
However, I saw no evidence that XML was over. When one looked a little deeper than the paper title, it was pretty obvious that applications were being built on top of XML, and that the semantic web helped little to none. XML may not sound as sexy as the semantic web, but it's infinitely more useful for getting the job done.
</p>

<p>
What's the second thing I noticed? Well, there was one technology shown at the conference that did sneak up on me, that I haven't paid much attention to in the past, and that I'm now convinced is going to be a critical part of application development in the near future. 
This could well be the next big thing with an exponential growth curve that matches past stars like Java, XML, HTML, and Linux and with similarly disruptive effects on the development ecosystem. 
More on that subject tomorrow.

Day 4 (Developer Day)
of WWW2004 kicks off with an 8:30 A.M. morning keynote.
There are many fewer people here this morning, maybe 150.
 I remembered  the camera today so expect 
 more low quality, amateur pictures throughout the day.
 About three minutes before the conference closed, Stuart Roebuck <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/stuartroebuck/iblog/C1687433414/E506508692/">explained</a> why none of the microphones worked on my PowerBook.
I'll know for next time.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
The Developer Day Plenary is Doug Cutting talking about
<a href="http://www.nutch.org/">Nutch</a>, an open source search engine. His OpenOffice Impress slides "totally
failed to open this morning" so he reconstructed them in 5 minutes.
He contrasts Nutch with <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene">Lucene</a>.  Lucene is a 
mature, Apache project. It is a Java library for text indexing and search
meant to be embedded in other applications. It is <em>not</em> an end-user application.
JIRA, FURL, Lookout, and others use Lucene.
It is not designed for site search. "Documentation is always a hard one for open source projects to get right and books to ?tend to? help here."
</p>

<p>
Nutch is a young open source project for webmasters, still not end users.
It has a few part time paid developers. It is written in Java based on NekoHTML.
It is a search site, but wants "to power lots of sites". They may modify the license in the future.  They may use the license to force people to make the searches transparent. "Algorithms aren't really objective." <!-- expand from notes about 5 minutes in for qotd -->
It's a research project, but they're trying to reinvent what a lot of commercial companies have already invented. The goal is to increase the transparency of the web search. Why are pages ranked the way they are? 
Nutch is used by MozDex, Objects Search and other search engines.
</p>

<p>
Technical goals are scaling well, billions of pages, millions of servers, very noisy data, complete crawl takes weeks, thousands of searches per second, state-of-the-art search result quality. One terabyte of disk per 100 million pages. It's a distributed system.
They use link analysis over the link database (various possible algorithms)
and anchor text indexing (matches to search terms). 90% of the improvement is done by anchor text indexing as opposed to link analysis. They're within an order of magnitude of the state of the art and probably better than that. Calendars are tricky (infinite page count). Link analysis doesn't help on the Intranet.
</p>

<p>
In Q&amp;A a concern is raised about the performance of
using threads vs. asynchronous I/O
for fetching pages. Cutting says he tried java.nio and it didn't work.
They could saturate the ISPs' connections using threads. The I/O API is not a bottleneck.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
Paul Ford of <a href="http://www.harpers.org/">Harper's</a> is showing an amusing semantic web app.
However, it uses pure XML. It does <strong>not</strong> use RDF.
They do have taxonomies. "It's all done by hand." At least the markup is doen by hand in vi and BBEdit. This is then slurped up in XSLT 2 (Saxon), and HTML is spit out onto the site. It was hard to get started but easy to keep rolling. RDF is not right for redundant content and conditionals. They can use XSLT to move to real RDF if they ever need to.  This is in the semantic web track, but it occurs to me that if this had been presented five yhears ago we would have just called it an XML app. They do use a taxonomy they've developed, but it's all custom markup and names. They aren't even using URIs to name things as near as I can tell. The web site published HTML and RSS. The original marked up content is not published. 
</p>
<hr />
<p>
The MuseumFinland is trying to enable search across all 1000 or so Finnish museums. 
</p>
<hr />
<p>
The Simile Project is trying to provide semantic interoperability for 
digital library metadata. "metadata quality is a function of heterogeneity"
Open questions for the semantic web: How do you deal with disagreements?
How do you distinguish disgareements from mistakes?
</p>
<hr />
<p>
This conference is making me think a lot about the semantic web.
I'm certainly learning more about the details (RDF, OWL etc.). However, I still don't see the point. For instance what does RDF bring to the party? The basic idea of RDF is that a collection of URIs forms a vocabulary. Different organizations and people define different vocabularies, and the URIs sort out whose name, date, title, etc. property
you're using at any given time. Remind you of anything? It reminds me a lot of XML + namespaces. What exactly does RDF bring to the party? OWL (if I understand it) lets you connect different vocabularies. But so does XSLT.
I guess the RDF model is a little simpler. It's all just triples, that can be automatically combined with other triples, and thereby inferences can be drawn. 
Does this actually produce anything useful, though? 
I don't see the killer app. Theoretically a lot of people are talking about combining RDF and ontologies from multiple sources too find knowledge that
isn't obvious from any one source. However, no one's actually publishing their RDF. They're all transforming to HTML and publishing that. 
</p>

<p>
Usability of RDF is a common theme among the semanticists. 
They all see various GUIs being used to store and present RDF.
They all want to hide the RDF from end users. It's not clear, however, if there is (or can be, or should be) a generic RDF GUI like the browser is for HTML (or even XML, with style sheets).

<img src="images/lunch.jpg" alt="Lunch at Developer's Day  at WWW2004" width="640" height="306" />

<p>
After an entertaining lunch featuring Q&amp;A with Tim Berners-Lee (shown above),
I decided to desert the semantic web for the final afternoon of the show.
Instead I've gone off to learn about the much more practical XForms. Unlikke the semantic web, I believe XForms really can work. My main question is whether browsers will ever implement this, or if there'll be other interesting implementations. 
</p>


<p>
The session begins with a tutorial from the W3C's 
always entertaining Stephen Pemberton.
He claims 20+ implementations on the day of the release and about 30 now. 
Some large companies (U.S. Navy, Bristol-Myers-Squibb, Daiwa, Frauenhofer) are already using this. He's repeating a lot of his points from <a href="oldnews/news2004May19.html#id2592084">Wednesday</a>.
XForms separates the data being collected and the constraints on it
(the model) from the user interface. 
</p>

<img src="images/xformspanel.jpg" alt="XForms speakers at WWW2004" width="640" height="216" />


<p>
What's d16n? It's not just for forms. You can also use it for editing XML, spreadsheet like apps, output transformations, etc.
</p>

<p>
Fields are hidden by default. There's no <code>form</code> element any more. I'm not sure I'm going to write any more about the syntax.
It's too hard to explain without seeing thre examples, and I can't type that fast, but it is quite clean. XForms support HTTP PUT! (and GET and POST. DELETE and WebDAV methods are not supported in 1.0 but may be added in the future.)
You can submit to XML-RPC and SOAP as well as HTTP servers.
And it works with all well-formed XML pages, not just XHTML (but not classic, malformed HTML). XForms has equivalents for all HTML form widgets, and may customize some according to data type. Plus it adds a range control and
an output control. There are toggles and switches to hide and reveal parts of the user interface. These are useful for wizards.
There are repeating fields like in FileMaker. It supports conditionals.
A single form can be submitted to multiple servers.
</p>

<p>
One thing strikes me as dangerous about XForms: they provide so much power to restrict what can be entered that  server side developers are likely
to not validate the input like they should, instead relying on the client to have checked the input. It would still be possible to feed unexpected input to the server by using a different server or
a client that doesn't enforce the constraints. 
</p>

<p>
An XForm result may replace only the form  instance, not the whole page,
but what then 
about namespace mappings, etc.? What is the URI of the combined page? 
This is a very tricky area.
</p>

<a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/People/raman/raman.html">T. V. Raman</a>, author of
<cite><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321154991/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/">XForms: XML Powered Web Forms</a></cite>,
is talking about XForms accessibility and usability. 
"People get so hung up on RDF's syntax. That's not why it's there."
He predicts that Mark Birbeck will implement a semantic web browser in XForms, purely by writing angle brackets (XForms code) without 
writing regular source code. According to Pemberton, CSS is adding a lot of properties specifically for use with XForms.

<a href="http://www.pureedge.com/">Pure Edge</a>'s John  Boyer is speaking about security in in XForms. Maybe he'll address my question about server side validation of user input. Hmm, it seems sending the data as a full XML document rather than as a list of
name=value pairs might solve this. It would allow the server to easily use standard validation talks. This talk is mostly concerned with XML digital signatures and its supporting technologies. Now on the client side, how does the client know what he or she is signing? If an XML document is transmitted, what's the guarantee that that XML document was correctly and fully displayed to the user? Is what you see, what you signed? e.g. was the color of the fine print the same as the background color of the page? It turns out they have thought of this. The entire form document, plus all style sheets, etc, are signed.

<p>
The last speaker of the afternoon (and the conference) is Mark Seaborne, who will be talking about using XForms. His slide show is in an XForm.
He's using an XForm control to step through the forms! He works in insurance in the UK, an industry that's completely paper forms driven. 
It's important that the users not have to fill in the full form before
rejections are detected. "There's a huge number of projects listed on the W3C website, but most of them aren't finished and some of them are actually dead." There are lots of different bugs and inconsistencies between different implementations, many of which have to do with CSS. IBM has announced that they're starting work on putting XForms support into Mozilla.

Day 3 of WWW2004 kicks off with the usual 9:00 A.M. morning keynote.
The conference is beginning to drag a bit, and there are maybe half as many people here this morning as yesterday. No pictures today. I remembered to 
charge up the camera and then forgot to put it back in my bag when I left the house.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/17392">Audio Recorder</a> did provide a nice simple way to record an MP3 file of the day's proceedings. However, the internal microphone in my PowerBook
paid more attention to the keyboard clicks than the speakers. I've brought a couple of external microphones this morning to try them out. Hmm, OK the first microphone has the wrong plug for this laptop. That's why I brought two. Hmm, the second one plugs in but doesn't seem to be hearing anything.
Possibly that's not a microphone port on the back of my TiBook. Maybe I need a USB microphone? No, according to Apple's <a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=86283">this tech note</a>
and  <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Hardware/Developer_Notes/Macintosh_CPUs-G4/15inchPowerBookG4/3Input-Output/chapter_4_section_16.html">another tech note</a>,
that is indeed a line-in port on the back of my laptop. Maybe I need a <a href="http://www.macmice.com/micflex.html">newer microphone</a>?
A sensible person might have tried plugging these in at home before dragging them into town, but what would be the excitement of that?
Maybe I'll run down to CompUSA at lunch.

<p>
This morning's keynote will be delivered by <a href="http://www.internetnews.com/bus-news/article.php/3351281">Mozelle Thompson</a>, of the Federal Trade Commission. "I have a few notes, but I don't have a PowerPoint presentation. I hate those. Good morning. I'm from the government and I'm here to help you." "We're a small agency but there are those who love us." When listing the laws they enforce,
the National Do Not Call list got applause. The Can-Spam Act got silence.
About 4 or 5 people in the room admit to having been victims of identity theft. It looks like about half the audience is from outside the U.S.
53,000,000 phone numbers on the Do-Not-Call list. He opposes spyware legislation "at this time." He thinks such legislation is likely to be overbroad, and cover legitimate, consumer beneficial activities like instant updates and anti-virus updates. To head off Congress, he asked industry to, within 90 days, give consumers meaningful notice of what they're doing.
Next, he asked them to develop a public education campaign about spyware.
Finally he asked the industry to develop a mechanism to talk to washington to identify the really bad actors. If industry does not act, he thinks legislators will act on incomplete, inaccurate information.
Stopping spam requires international cooperation. Defensive use of patents
is not well reflected in current system.

Today's second keynote is "Higher Learning in the Digital Age"
from James J. Duderstadt of the University of Michigan.
he thinks the Internet/Web could change higher education in the next decade or two as radically as changed in the two decades after the Civil War. Peer-to-peer interaction is replacing traditional professor-student
learning. (I'm not sure I believe this. I certainly don't see it in my own classes at Polytechnic. To the extent they're learning from each other, they're learning bad habits. Perhaps they could learn very rough things like how to put a window on the screen, but 
they certainly aren't learning how to write code well by reading the Internet and talking to each other. Maybe what he describes is more true in elite universities like Carnegie-Mellon &mdash; one of his example &mdash;
or in undergraduate classes &mdash; I mostly teach graduate students,
but with some undergraduates mixed in. However, I rarely see my students teaching each other. Half of them barely talk to anyone else in the class.
When they do talk to each other, they're more interested in copying the homework than learning or teaching how to do something.)
For the near-term (next decade) universities look pretty much like they do now. But over the longer term, the basic structure of the university may change in dramatic ways.

For the morning sessions I decided to go to the panel discussion of
"Multimodal Interaction with XML: Are We There Yet?" Alan Turing: "A machine is intelligent only if it can carry on an intelligent conversation." Participants include Kuansan Wang of Microsoft, IBM's Yi-Ming Chee, Motorola's Mark Randolph, 
AT&amp;T's Michael Johnson, the W3C's Max Froumentin,
and Carnegie Mellon's Alex Rudnicky.
</p>

<p>
Question: Is it possible yet to use XML as the prime language in multimodal interaction, and what is still missing in current XML technology in order for XML to play that role? According to Michael Johnson?, speech is the most developed modality. Pen and gesture support is far behind. 
"Is it useful to create common XML standards for multimodal interaction?"
"What kind of role should XML standards play, and what part of multimodal interaction can be standardized to accelerate the use of XML in multimodal interaction?" There's some restrained dispute about the verbosity of XML,
and whether it matters. "What levels of semantics can XML represent in multimodal interaction?"
Alex Rudnicky says we don't yet know the right primitives or levels of abstraction for multimodal interaction. "What is the product/research use of XML for multimodal interaction?"
</p>

<p>
First afternoon session.
The current talk is about TeXQuery, which has nothing to do with TeX.
It's an extension to XQUery for full text search.
It allows you to prioritize matches to particular terms; e.g. 
finding all documents with an 0.8 score for "Goddesses" and an 0.2 score for "Nike." Co-authors are 
Sihem Amer-Yahia, 
Chavdar Botev, and 
Jayavel Shanmugasundaram. I missed which one was actually presenting.
It looks interesting, but the name has to change.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
Sebastiano Vigna, of the  UniversitÃ  degli Studi di Milano
is talking about 
"<a href="http://webgraph.dsi.unimi.it/">The WebGraph Framework I: Compression Techniques</a>"
(co-author: Paolo Boldi). He wants to store the entire web directed
graph (in a mathematical sense where URIs are nodes and links are arcs) which requires significant compressions because the Web is so big.
It's nice to see some math for a change, but the practical impact (if any) escapes me. Apparently it escapes Vigna as well.
"We do it because it's fun." It does let you do Google-like page rank tests on a PC. They got slashdotted. They can compress down to 3-3.5 bits per link. "WebGraph exploits the fact that many links within a page are consecutive (with respect to lexicographic order)." He's running RedHat on his laptop. First time I've noticed that at this show
(though PowerBooks are fairly common).
</p>

<hr />
<p>
For the final session of the regular conference, I plan to return to the W3C track to hear about "Future Work in W3C - Public Q&amp;A" chaired by Steve Bratt. First, Tim Berners-Lee is talking about "<a href="http://www.w3.org/2004/Talks/0521-sb-newideas/">What is coming up in W3C?</a>" and then there's the public Q&amp;A session.
TimBL uses a PowerBook, and writes (or at least published)  his slides in HTML, and he has iTunes playing some New York themed jazz before the session starts. The outline for the talk is:
</p>

<dl>

	<dt>    What Might be Next for W3C? ...</dt>
		<dd>     New Working Groups
         on XML Binary Characterization, SYMM, Math Interest Group, RDF Data Access, and Semantic Web Best Practices and Deployment. The
QA working group has not attracted a lot of volunteers from W3C members.
Everyone wants someone else to do it. 
</dd>
	<dt>  Considerations for New Work (part 1)</dt>
		<dd>  <p>
Future of XML. XML attracted the least interest of all
		the tracks here at WWW 2004. "Maybe it's kind of done." XML is the foundation. "For a lot of people XML's done". 
(I'm not convinced: I think a lot of XML folks may have just gone to Amsterdam last month instead of this show. There were a lot of people there I don't see here. In fact, off the top of my head there's exactly one speaker in common between the two.)
However, RDF has noticed that 
merging pieces of documents isn't really well addressed.
Maybe this requires more work? 
</p>

<p>
The Semantic Web is driving interest in privacy because people are scared of what the semantic Web may do.
</p>

<p>
Should the W3C open up broad horizontal apps/vocabularies such as life sciences, geospatial, calendaring, social networking (e.g. Friendster), publishing/syndication/RSS, etc.? Calendaring work is ongoing at the IETF.
He mistakenly claims RSS 0.9 wasn't RDF. I don't think that's quite true.
It was consistent with the RDF draft in existence at the time.
</p>

<p>
There's an upcoming workshop on device independence in October,
location to be announced.
</p>
 </dd>
	<dt>    Considerations for New Work (part 2)</dt>
		<dd> Usability is not just accessibility.
		Why content filtering for just mobile devices? 
		"It's amazing how little we do that is secure. How 
		few things are signed and encrypted." What are we going to about the digital divide between the developed and developing world?</dd>
</dl>


<p>
Q&amp;A commences. According to IBM's Mary Ellen Zurko, Germany is considering banning JavaScript. One of the panelists (Phillippe?)
suggests that asking users if they want to run active code is pointless.
They always click OK. Zurko agrees. TimBL: "Should the W3C start looking at mail?" The W3C has three people fighting spam full time. "Nominally not really in our area." Are the groups looking at spam too academic, he wonders?
</p>

<p>
TimBL: Haystack is a new UI metaphor.
There's a "dire need" for a good user interface for the semantic web.
</p>

<p>
A couple of questions from the audience:
What about publishing and annotations?  TimBL recounts 
some interesting history. Amaya does do annotations.
</p>

<p>
Fabio Vitali wants to know why there aren't synchronous HTML editors/browsers. If I understand him, this is editing directly in the browser frame without switching modes and saving just as you would in a word processor (e.g. like I've been saving these notes in BBEdit directly onto the site for the last three days).
</p>

<p>
TimBL: "The Semantic Web is not AI. It's just databases....nobody doing the semsntic web is holding their breath for strong artificial intelligence."
</p>

The hotel air conditioning seems to be set to "Ice Box" and 
I've developed a nasty cold over the last three days.
If it doesn't get worse, I'll probably be back tomorrow for the Developer Day.

Today I'm at WWW2004 in New York again, I'll be here through Saturday,
and live updates will continue
as long as my laptop battery and the wireless network hold out.
There may be fewer photos today, though, since I forgot to charge up my camera battery last night. :-(
</p>

<p>
By the way, if anyone wants to post notes from the sessions I can't attend (they're about six running in parallel) I'll be happy to post them here.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
Thursday kicks off with keynotes by Udi Manber of Amazon.com and Rick Rashid from Microsoft. Apparently this morning is a joint session with the ACM SIG-ECOM. I guess there's an e-commerce conference running simultaneously. 
</p>

<p>
Rashid's nominal topic is "Empowering the Individual". "Scientists and engineers don't create the future. We create the physical and intellectual raw materials from which the future can be built." He's mostly telling us things we already knew, including that the Internet squashed 
Microsoft's vision of the Information superhighway as effectively as an 18-wheeler squashes an armadillo (my metaphor, not his). Plus he's said several things that sound great, but that Microsoft is actively working against, notable sharing what you want, when you want, with who you want.
He's feeding us a line of absolute crap about a virtual telescope that just doesn't fit with how astronomy really works. There may be something valuable in what he's referring to, but there's no way it's anything like what he's saying. 
</p>

<p>
He's talking about people sharing with each other. 
He's not (yet) talking about sharing with big corporations, 
telemarketers, law enforcement, etc. Something called <a href="http://mywallop.com/">Wallop</a> is Microsoft's response to blogging/Friendster. They add rich multimedia information. It involves a dynamically computed social network.
</p>

<p>
Moving on to storage. What happens when the individual has a terabyte of storage? Today, it costs about $1000. That's a lifetime of conversation or a year of full-motion video. (I'm not sure those numbers add up. One DVD is five gigs and that's only two hours). <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/adapt/sis/">Stuff I've Seen</a>: 
archive everything you've ever looked at on the Web, all e-mail (from Outlook), and everything in your Documents folder. The logical extreme is the <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/research/hwsystems/">SenseCam</a> (Lyndsay Williams, et al), a gargoyle? in Neal Stephenson's terminology (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553380958/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/">Snowcrash</a>) that records everything you see and hear. Well, not quite everything. The current prototype only captures 2000 
still images a day. Image captures can be triggered by various triggers. It uses a fisheye lens, which is a bad idea (IMO). A regular lens that focuses on what I'm looking at would make a lot more sense. I'm generally not very interested in what happens 90&deg; away from where I'm looking. Of course, this raises privacy issues. Can the government subpoena this stuff? Of course. They can subpoena personal diaries now. 
</p>

<hr />
<p>
Anyone know of a good audio recording package for Mac OS X that allows me to record lectures straight from my PowerBook? Maybe iMovie can do it?
Hmm, it's complaining about the disk responding too slowly. It also seemed to stop recording after about 14 seconds. And the audio quality is pretty low. Pradeep Bashyal and Stuart Roebuck both suggested <a href="http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/17392">Audio Recorder</a>. Downloading it now. At first glance, it seems to work, and it's nice and simple. It takes about 1 meg a minute for MP3 recording.
After the session is over I'll have to see if it actually recorded anything. David Pogue <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/20/technology/circuits/20stat.html?ex=1400385600&amp;en=c1dcafcaba3a504e&amp;ei=5007&amp;partner=USERLAND">suggests Microsoft Word 2004</a>.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
Udi Manber of Amazon/A9 isn't allowed to talk about other 
companies or what they're working on now by Amazon policy. 
(Someone needs to buy a ticket on the <a href="http://www.cluetrain.com/">cluetrain</a>.) They aren't trying to compete with Google. Some observations about search:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Ease of use is a huge barrier to advanced search techniques. </li>
	<li>Relevancy is hard to measure, and changes all the time, and is different for different people. It's difficult because it's about people, not material.</li>
	<li>Anecdotes (particular queries) will lead you astray.</li>
	<li>It's not about speed or size; it's all about quality/relevancy of results.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Bottom line: search is hard.
</p>

<p>
He's talking about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/cafeaulaitA/">search inside the book</a>. They scanned all the books themselves. 
They originally planned to use screensavers to do the OCR, but they found idle disaster recovery machines to do the work. About half the audience here today has tried this (according to a quick show of hands). Edd (on IRC) suggests ego-surfing inside the book.
</p>


<p>
A9 can remember searches over time, and the new results called out.
Can annotate pages with a diary using the A9 toolbar.</p>

<p>A pessimist sees the glass as half empty. An optimist sees the glass as half full.
A engineer sees  a glass that's twice as large as necessary. If the audio recording works so I can get the exact wording on that, and if it turns out not be by somebody else, that may be a quote of the day. Nope, appears to <a href="http://www.boardofwisdom.com/default.asp?topic=1005&amp;listname=Engineering">not be original</a>. 
</p>

<p>
What if everyone becomes an author?
</p>
<hr />
<p>
For the first parallel sessions this morning I think I'm going to return to the W3C track for Semantic Web, Phase 2: Developments and Deployment.
Hopefully I can snag an electrical outlet since my battery is running down.
If not, you may not hear from me till lunch.

<p>
Eric Miller is delivering a <a href="http://www.w3.org/2004/Talks/0520-em-swa/">Semantic Web Activity Update</a>. (When looking at the notes, just cancel the username/password dialog and you'll get in.) The RDF working group charter will expire and not be renewed 
at the end of the May. Application work will continue.  The RDF Data Access Group led by Dan Connolly is moving quickly and will publish its first public draft soon. The Semantic Web Best Practices and Deployment Working Group provides "guidance, in the form of documents and demonstrators, for developers of Semantic Web applications."
Several other individuals are now going to demonstrate examples of deployment beginning with Chuck Meyers.
</p>

<p>
Chuck Meyers from Adobe says the latest Adobe publishing products are all RDF enabled using the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/xmp/main.html">Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP)</a>. The problem is someone has to enter the metadata to go with the pictures, but they do import Exif data from digital photos. (Now if only my digital camera would stop forgetting the date.) This work goes back six years. The toolkit is open source, and 3rd party ports have expanded platform support. Going open source is unusual for Adobe. XMP uses processing instructions?!? for a lot of content. It's not clear why they don't use plain elements. I couldn't see what RDF brought to this party that you can't get from regular XML.
</p>


<img src="images/ChuckMeyers.jpg" alt="Chuck Meyers at WWW2004" width="640" />

<p>
Frank Careccia from Brandsoft is talking about <cite>Commercializing RDF</cite>. "RDF is to enterprise software what IP was to networking."
Lack of ownership of corporate web sites is a problem. There's no 
control. He sees this as a problem rather than a strength. He wants to
present one unified picture of the company to the outside world, rather than letting the individual people and departments explain themselves. 
Another person who needs a ticket on the cluetrain. 
</p>


<img src="images/Careccia.jpg" alt="Frank Careccia at WWW2004" width="640" />


<p>
Dennis Kwan from IBM is talking about BioHaystack; a gateway to the Biological Semantic Web. They want to automate the gathering of data from multiple sites. LSID URNs are a common naming convention. The trick identifying the same objects across different databases. They want non-programmers to be able to use BioHaystack to be able to access these heterogenous biological data sources. So far this talk came closer than most SW talks to actually saying something. I felt like I could almost see a real problem being solved here, but still not quite.
The talk was not concrete enough to show how RDF and friends actually solved a concrete problem. 
</p>


<img src="images/DennisKwan.jpg" alt="Dennis Kwan at WWW2004" width="640" />


<p>
Jeff Pollock? from Network Inference is talking about the business 
case for the Semantic Web. Customers are not interested in Semantic Web solutions per se. They're looking for painkillers rather than vitamins, but he thinks SW is a painkiller that can reduce cost. RDF and OWL enable standard, machine interpretable semantics. XML enables only syntax. 
Or at least so he claims. I agree about XML, but so far I've yet to see evidence that there's more semantics in RDF/OWL than in plain XML. 
</p>


<img src="images/JeffPollock.jpg" alt="Jeff Pollock at WWW2004" width="640" />


<p>
There's a huge number of big words being tossed around this morning (business inferencing, .NET tier, dynamic applications, reclassify corporate data,
proprietary metadata markup, "align the semantics of federated distributed sources", "rich, automatic, service orchestration", etc.) which mostly seems to obscure the fact that none of this does anything. 
OK, finally he talks about a use case of a chart of accounts problem for a Fortune 500 electronics corp. Reporting dollars for cameras vs.phones for cameras phones. OK. This is somewhat concrete, but I'd like to see more details.
</p>

<p>
Finally Dave Reynolds from HP is talking about work at HP Labs.
Jena is an open source semantic web framework. Joseki is Jena's RDF server.
"There's no single killer app." They're investing in and exploring a broad range of applications: Semantic blogging, information portals,
and SMILE Joint. He's describing several application areas, but again I don't see how RDF/OWL have anything to do with what he's talking about.
I realized part of the problem: no one is showing any code. I feel like I'm a mechanical engineer in 1904 listening to a bunch of other engineers talks about airplanes, but nobody's willing to show me how they actually expect to get their flying machines into the air. Maybe they can do it, but I won't believe it until I see a plane in the air, and even then I really want to take the machine apart before I believe it isn't a disguised hot air balloon. A lot of what I'm hearing this morning sounds like it could float a few balloons.

Question from the audience: have any of you done any testing to make sure your products are interoperable? 
</p>
<hr />
<p>
For the first block of afternoon parallel sessions I headed down to conference room E,
which apparently also has one of those annoying routers that lets you connect but doesn't provide DNS service. Bleah. 
Consequently you won't get to read these notes in real time, but at least I can spell check them before posting. One of the conference organizers 
is hunting down the network admins to see if they can fix it, so maybe you'll get to read these a little sooner, but I'm not holding my breath.
I finally managed to connect to the wireless network in the next room over.
I'm not sure how long this will work.
This room's router still isn't working. Hmm, I think I just spotted it. I wonder what would happen if I just walked over and rebooted it? 
</p>

<p>
The first afternoon session is 
Optimizing Encoding, chaired by Junghoo Cho of UCLA.
The first of three talks in this session is Xinyi Yin of the National University of Singapore on 
"Using Link Analysis to Improve layout on Mobile Devices."
(Co-author: Wee Sun Lee). The challenge is too provide a reasonable browsing experience on a mobile device with small screen and low bandwidth.
They use an idea similar to Google's page rank to select the most important information on the page, and present that
most important content only (or first) on the small screen. That sounds very challenging and original. (The presenter does know of some prior art though, which he cites, even though I hadn't heard of it.) However, they weight elements' importance by the probability of the user focusing on an object and by the probability of the user's eye moving from that object to another object. Mostly this seems to be based on size with some additional weight given to the objects in the center, the width/height ratio. 
(Unimportant info like navigation bars and copyright info tend to be 
quite narrow), and the connection between words in the object and words in the URL. This is primarily designed for new sites like CNN.
</p>

<p>
The talk that sold me on the Optimizing Encoding session was 
IBM's Roberto J. Bayardo "An Evaluation of Binary XML Encoding Optimizations for Fast Stream based XML Processing."
(Co-authors: Daniel Gruhl, Vanja Josifvoski, and Jussi Myllymaki)
I suspect I'll hate it, but I could be wrong. My prediction for  yesterday's schema talk proved to be quite off base. Maybe these guys will surprise me too. My specific prediction is that they'll speed up 
XML processing by failing to do well-formedness checking. Of course, they'll hide that in a binary encoding and claim the speed gain is from 
using binary rather than text. However, I've seen a dozen of these binary 
panaceas and they never really work the way the authors think they work. 
An XML processor needs to be able to accept <strong>any</strong>
stream of data and behave reliably, without crashing, freezing, or reporting incorrect content. And indeed a real XML parser can do exactly this. No matter what you feed it, it either succeeds or reports an error in a predictable, safe way. Most binary schemes incorrectly assume that because the data is binary they don't need to check it for well-formedness.
But as anyone who's ever had Microsoft Word crash because of a corrupted .doc file or had to restore a hosed database from a backup should know, that's not actually true. Binary data is often incorrect, and robust programs need to be prepared for that. XML parsers are robust. Most binary parsers aren't. The fact is when you pull well-formedness checking out of a text-based XML parser it speeds up a lot too, as many developers of incomplete parsers like ???? have found.  Binary is not fundamentally faster than text, as long as the binary parser does the same work as the text based parser does.   Anyway, that's my prediction for where this talk is going (I haven't read the paper yet.) In an hour, we'll see if my prediction was right.
</p>

<p>
He thinks XML is too heavyweight for high performance apps. (I completely disagree. I'm really having to bite my tongue here to let the speaker finish in his allotted small time.) both in parsing overhead and space requirements. "Bad side of XML is addressed by throwing away (much of) the good side."  XML compression trades speed for small size. Also negatively impacts the ability to stream. Some parsing optimizations slow down the encoding. In other words they trade speed of encoding for speed of decoding. He's only considering single stream encodings. 
Strategies tested include:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Alternate delimiters</li>
	<li>Tokenization of common strings: string table makes this inappropriate for streaming because you need to know the tokenized string in advance. But demand driven tokenization may work, but causes problems for random access.</li>
	<li>Random access (indexing) support: doesn't work well with most APIs and many queries </li>
	<li>Schema-based optimizations: doesn't work for schema-less documents and brittle in face of schema changes</li>
</ul>

<p>
Most of their evaluations are based on IBM's 
XTalk plus various enhanced versions of XTalk.
(He seems to be confusing SAX with unofficial 
C++ versions. ) TurboXPath is a representative application.
Two sample data sets: record-oriented (a big bibliography, 180MB) and
more deeply nested collection of real estate listings grouped by cities
(50 MB). Used Visual C+++ on Windows. Linux results were similar. 
They tested expat and Xerces-C. (Why not libxml2?) Their numbers show maybe a third to a half improvement by using binary parsing. expat was three times faster than Xerces-C. (on their first example query). On the second query, improvement is a little more, but in the same ballpark. Skip pointers are a significant improvement here. "Don't throw out plain XML if you haven't tried expat." "Java and DOM based parsers are not competitive."
</p>

<p>
It took till Q&amp;A to find out for sure, but
I was right. They aren't doing full well-formedness checking. For instance, they don't check for legal characters in names. 
That's why XTalk is faster. They claim expat isn't either (I need to check that) but there was disagreement from the audience on this point. But the bottom line is they failed to demonstrate a difference in speed due to binary vs. text.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
The closing talk of this session is Les Kitchen
 of the University of Melbourne (co-author Jacqueline Spiesser) on "Optimization of HTML Automatically Generated by WYSIWYG programs" such as Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, 
Microsoft FrontPage and Microsoft Publisher. (The talk should really be titled "Optimization of HTML Automatically Generated by Microsoft programs.") This was inspired by an HTML train timetable that too 20 minutes to download over a modem.
</p>

<p>Techniques:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Parsing/unparsing</li>
	<li>Factoring out style classes</li>
	<li>Attribute rearrangement (moving common 
	    attributes to parent elements)</li>
	<li>Dead code Elimination</li>
</ul>

<p>
Sizes went from 53% of original to 142% of original based on parsing and unparsing alone. Adding the factoring out of style classes brings this from 39% to 89% of the original sizes. Optimal attribute placement improves this
again, but I'm not sure I'm reading the numbers in his table correctly.
 Optimal attribute placement  is slow. Total of all four optimizations reduces size to  33% to 72% of the original size. 56% is the "totally bogus average on such a small data set." Their implementation was written in Haskell.
</p>

<p>
He suggests plugging this in as a proxy server or a stand-alone optimizer. However, 
to my way of thinking this needs to be fixed in Microsoft Word (and similar tools). Fixing it anywhere else will have a negligible impact.

For the second session block of the afternoon I was torn between <cite>XForms</cite> and
<code>XML: Progress Report and new Initiatives</code>; but I picked the latter to see what Liam Quin had to say about the progress of "<a href="http://www.w3.org/2004/Talks/0517-quin-binaryxml/">Binary Interchange of XML</a>." However, the session begins with Lionel Villard's inoffensive XSLT 2.0 tutorial. There don't seem to be any surprises here.

Michael Rhys, SQL Server program manager at Microsoft (which has recently pledged not to support XSLT 2) is now
going to talk about XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2. XQuery was the largest working group up to that time. SOAP later surpassed it. "It's huge. There are functions in there I haven't even seen yet." There are over 1200
public comments; 50/50 editorial vs. substantive. "It probably takes another four years to get through with them. I hope not." Summer 2004 XQuery Full-Text language proposal published. Spring 2005 short last call period for  XQuery 1.0/XPath 2.0. Plan to finish in 2005.

<p>
Finally, the talk I came to hear: Liam Quin is talking about Binary Interchange of XML. "Wake up! This is the controversial stuff!" 
 No wonder: less than a minute in and he's already going off the rails. He explicitly  defines an XML document as some in-memory model that needs to be serialized with angle brackets. <strong>No! The angle brackets serialization is the XML. The in memory data structure is not.</strong> 
Apparently schema-based schemes for binary formats have been ruled out.
That's good to hear. "You might lose comments or processing instructions"?!? That's shocking. These are in the infoset. 
Furthermore, he really wants to bring in binary data; not just binary encoded XML text but real binary data for video or mapping data.
This is a big extension of the XML story. It really adds something to the Infoset that isn't there today. What's being proposed is a lot more than a simple binary encoding for XML. It is a superset of the XML model, not an encoding of it! This is not even Infoset or XML API (SAX, DOM, XOM, etc.) compatible in any meaningful sense.
I know you could always encode everything in Base-64 but that would eliminate the speed and size advantages this effort is trying to achieve.
(David Booth suggests doing this with unparsed entities? Would that work? I need to think further on this.)
This is worse than I thought.
However, there may be hope.
According to the notes, the working group
"has a One-year charter; if they can't make a case by then, the case isn't yet strong enough." The clock started ticking three months ago.

<p>
Today I'm at WWW2004 in New York, I'll be here for the next 
four days. Fortunately there's wireless access here
(in fact, there are several wireless networks) 
so I'll be reporting live.
There don't seem to be a lot of PowerBooks here, but I should
 probably finally figure out how to use this iChat thingie to see if anyone else is chatting about this live. Wasn't there an O'Reilly article about this a year or so ago? Anyone have a URL? There don't seem to be a lot of power plugs here, though. This may grind to a halt in about two hours if I can't find a place to plug in.
</p>

<p>
Actually, it looks like people are using IRC.
xmlhack (may not be dead yet) is
running an <a href="http://www2004.xmlhack.com/">IRC channel</a> collecting various comments about the show. "To join in, point your IRC client at irc.freenode.net's #www2004 channel. The channel is publicly logged." I tried to login, but Mozilla's IRC client froze on me. 
It looks like <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla 1.7 RC 2 has just been posted</a>. I'll have to try that. OK, that seems to work.
The chat is being <a href="http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/discovery/chatlogs/www2004/">logged</a> for anyone who can't connect, or who just wants to read. 34 users online as of 3:00.
</p>

<p>
I'm doing something I don't normally do, editing this file directly on the 
live site, so there may be occasional glitches and spelling errors 
(or more than usual). I'll correct them as quickly as I can. 
Hmm, I already see one glitch. The non-ASCII characters got munged by BBEdit 
(again!). Can't we just all agree to use UTF-8, all the time? I'll fix it as soon as I get a minute. Also I reserve the right to change my mind and delete or rewrite something I've already written.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
Scanning the papers, I now understand why my XOM poster was rejected. 
I submitted the actual poster instead of a paper about the subject of the poster. I just wish I could have gotten someone to tell me this before I
wrote the thing. I asked repeatedly and was unable to get any 
useful information about what they were looking for in poster submissions.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
Day 1 (after two days of tutorials) kicks off with a keynote address from
Tim Berners-Lee. They're doing it in a ballroom with everyone seated at tables, which makes it feel a lot more crowded than it actually is. Still, it looks like there's about a thousand people here, give or take three hundred.
</p>

<p>
There are a few suits before Berners-Lee including someone from
the ACM (a cosponsor I assume) pitching ACM membership, 
someone who brings up 9/11 for no apparent reason, and someone from the Mayor's office.
(The Mayor is sorry he couldn't be here. We're very glad to have you here.
Technology is important. He proclaims today to be World Wide Web Day.
Yadda, yadda, yadda...)
</p>

<p>
OK, Berners-Lee is up now. He wants to randomly muse, especially on
<a href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/TLD">top-level domain names</a> and the semantic web. He thinks .biz and .info have been little more than
added expense. He doesn't see why we need more. 
.xxx is wrong place to put metadata about what is and is not porn. 
People have different ideas about this.
"I have a fairly high tolerance for people with no clothes on and a fairly low tolerance for violence." .mobi is also misguided, but for different reasons.
Shouldn't need a different URI for mobile content. Instead use content negotiation (my inference, not his statement). Plus it's not clear what a mobile device is: no keyboard? low bandwidth? These issues change from device to device and over time. The device independence working group is addressing these, but the problem is more complicated than can be fixed by adding .mobi to the end of a few URIs. The <a href="http://www.w3.org/">W3C site</a> works pretty well on cell phones.
CSS is a success story we should celebrate. 
</p>
<img src="images/bernersleekeynote.jpg" alt="Tim Berners-Lee opening keynote at WWW2004" width="640" height="480" />
<p>
On to the semantic Web. This actually helps with the mobile device problem by shipping the real info rather than a presentation of the real info. The user interface can be customized client side to the device. MIT's <a href="http://haystack.lcs.mit.edu/">Haystack</a> is an implementation of this idea. He wants to remove processing instructions from XML and bags from RDF (not that he really plans to do this or expects it to happen).
His point is that we have RDF even if the syntax is imperfect. (That's an understatement.) It's time to start using RDF. The semantic web phase 2 is coming. I didn't realize phase 1 was finished or working. I guess he sees phase 1 as the RDF and OWL specs. Phase 2 is actually using this stuff to build applications. I'm still a skeptic.
The semantic web requires URIs for names and identifiers. 
To drive adoptions, don't change existing systems. Instead use RDF adapters. Justify on short term gain rather than network effect.
We have to put up the actual OWL ontologies, not hide them behind presentational HTML. Let a thousand ontologies bloom. We don't need to standardize the ontolgies. It's all about stitching different ontologies together.
</p>

<p>
I found a power plug, so I should be able to keep this up through at least the next couple of sessions. Unfortunately, the wireless network in the
current room is having DNS troubles (or at least it is with my PowerBook; others seem to be connecting fine) so you may not read this in real time. :-( The XML sessions this afternoon are in a different room. Hopefully the wireless will work there.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
As usual at good conferences, there are a lot of interesting sessions to choose from.
I decided to sit in the security and privacy track for this morning.
There appears to be only one half-day track on XML, happening this afternoon.
</p>

<p>
The session has three talks. First up is an IBM/Verity talk on "Anti-Aliasing on the Web." by Jasmine Novak, Prabhakar Raghavan, and
Andrew Tomkins (presented by Novak). The question: Is it possible to
discover if an author is writing under multiple aliases/pseudonyms by
analyzing their text? Stylometrics uses a large body of text figure out
who wrote what. This goes back at least 40 years. Think of the outing of
Joe Klein as the author of <cite>Primary Colors</cite>, but there are
also cases where this technique has failed. Traditionally this  uses
small, function words like "but", "and", etc. that are
topical-vocabulary independent. Also emoticons. She claims they achieved
an error rate of less than 8% based on fewer words. Their research is
based on Court TV message boards, specifically the Lacy Peterson case
and the war in Iraq. 
They gave postings fake aliases and then attempted
to reunite them. They used 50 messages, and removed signatures, headers, and other content that would
clearly reveal who was who. The idea is to see if they can then
reconnect the messages to the authors. Using all words proved to be the
best algorithm, though in this case everyone was writing on the same
topic to begin with, and the amount of text analyzed was small so the
traditional reasons for analyzing by function words don't apply. They
use compression theory to measure the similarity of two texts, based on
optimal encodings (KL similarity).
</p>


<p>
Could this be fooled by a deliberate effort to fool it? e.g. I overuse the word <i>use</i>. What if I deliberately wrote under a pseudonym 
without using the word <i>use</i>? What if I used tools to check 
how similar something I was writing pseudonymously was to 
my usual writing? They have considered this, and think it would be possible. 
</p>

<p>
There seems to be a big flaw in this research.
First is the extremely small sample size, which is not nearly large enough to prove the algorithm actually works, especially since they used this data to choose the algorithm. To be valid this needs to be tested on many other data sets. Ideally this should be a challenge response; i.e. I send them data sets where they don't know who's who. I may be misinterpreting what she's saying about the methodology. I'll have to read the paper. 
</p>

<p>
She says, this would not scale to millions of aliases and terabytes of data. In Q&amp;A she admits a problem with two people on opposite sides of the argument being misidentified as identical because they tend to use the same words when replying to each other.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
Next up Fang Yu of Academica Sinica is talking about static analysis of web application security. I'm quite fond of static analysis tools, in general.
Because web applications are public, almost by definition, firewalls can't help. Symantec estimates that 8 of the top 10 threats are web application vulnerabilities. The problem is well known. You write a CGI script that passes commands to the shell, and the attacker passes unexpected data (e.g. "elharo; \rm -r *" instead of just a user name) to 
run arbitrary shell commands. JWIG and JIF are Java tools for doing static analysis for these problems. Yu is interested in weakly typed languages such as PHP. His WebSSARI tool does static analysis on  PHP.
This requires type inference which imposes a performance cost.
They analyzed over one million lines of open source PHP code in 38 projects.
It reported  863 vulnerabilities, of which 607 were real problems.
The rest were false positives. That's pretty good. (Question from the audience: how does one assess the false negative rate?)
Co-authors include Yao-Wen Huang, Christian Hang, Chung-Hung Tsai, Der-Tsai Lee, and Sy-Yen Kuo.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
Halvard Skogsrud of the University of New South Wales is talking about 
"Trust-Serv: Model-Driven Lifecycle Management of Trust Negotiation Policies for Web Services." (Co-authors: Boualem Benatallah and Fabio Casati.) Trust negotiation maps well to state machines.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
The XML track kicks off the afternoon sessions (in a room with no wireless access at all,
I'm sorry to say so once again there won't be any realtime updates. Oh wait, looks like someone just turned on the router. Let's see if it works.
Cool! It does. Updates commencing now.)
There are about 45 people attending
There doesn't seem to be a lot of specifically XML content at this show,
just three sessions. I guess most of the XML folks are going to the
IDEAlliance shows instead. I've seen relatively few people I recognize,
neither the usual XML folks nor the usual New York folks. 
I do know a lot of the New York web crowd are getting ready for CEBIT 
next week.
</p>


<p>
Quanzhong Li of the University of Arizona/IBM is talking about 
"XVM: A Bridge between XML Data and its Behavior."
(Co-authors: Michelle Y Kim, Edward So, and Steve Wood)
So far this seems like another server side framework that decides
whether to send XML or HTML based on browser capabilities.
It loads different
code components for processing different elements as necessary.
XVM stands for "XML Virtual Machine", but I don't quite understand why.
I'll have to read the paper to learn more.
</p>

<img src="images/QuanzhongLi.jpg" alt="Quanzhong Li speaking at WWW 2004" width="291" height="479" />

<hr />


<p>
Fabio Vitali of the University of Bologna is talking about 
"SchemaPath, a Minimal Extension to XML Schema for Conditional Constraints"
(Co-authors: Claudio Sacerdoti Coen and 
Paolo Marinelli) Before I hear it, I'd guess this is about how to say things like
"the <code>xinclude:include</code> element can have an <code>xpointer</code> attribute only if the
<code>parse</code> attribute has the value <code>xml</code>." OK, let's see if I guessed right.
</p>

<p>
They divide schema languages into grammar based (RELAX NG, DTD, W3C XML Schema, etc.) and rule-based languages (XLinkIt, Schematron). Hmm, I wonder if he wants to add rules to W3C XML Schemas? He notes requirements that cannot be expressed in W3C XML schemas:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Mutual exclusion</li>
	<li>Deep exclusions (An XHTML <code>a</code> element cannot contain another <code>a</code> element, even as a descendant, not just as children)</li>
	<li>Structure dependent structures</li>
	<li>Data dependent structures: this is like the XInclude constraint I mentioned. Yep, I guessed right</li>
</ul>

<p>
He call these co-constraints or, more commonly, co-occurence constraints.
</p>

<p>
They add an <code>xsd:alt</code> element and an <code>xsd:error</code> type. The <code>xsd:alt</code> element allows conditional typing
(one type if condition is true, another type if it's false.) 
The condition is expressed as an XPath expression in a <code>cond</code>
attribute.
The 
 <code>xsd:error</code> type is used if the alternate condition is forbidden.
I need to look at this further, but this feels like a really solid idea that fills a major hole in the W3C XML Schema Language.
If I have this right, the XInclude constraint could be written like this:
</p>


<pre>&lt;xsd:element name="xinclude:include">
  &lt;xsd:alt cond="@parse='text' and @xpointer" type="xsd:error"/>
  &lt;xsd:alt type="<i>SomeNamedType</i>"/>
&lt;/xsd:element>
</pre>

<p>
This seems much simpler than adding a Schematron schema to
a W3C XML Schema Language annotation. I wonder if these folks are working on Schemas 1.1 at the W3C? 
</p>

<hr />

<p>
Martin Bernauer of the Vienna University of Technology
is talking about 
"Composite Events for XML"
(Co-authors: Gerti Kappel and Gerhard Kramler).
By event based processing he means things like SAX or DOM 2 Events.
Rules are executed/fired when triggers are detected. But DOM events are not always sufficient. He wants events that include multiple elements; e.g. an <code>item</code> element event followed by a <code>price</code> element event.
Composite events combine these individual events into the level of granularity/clumpiness appropriate for the application.
Traditionally this has been done with sequential events, but XML documents/events also have a hierarchical order. This work is based on something called "Snoop", which I haven't heard of before.
</p>

<img src="images/MartinBernauer.jpg" alt="Martin Bernauer talking at WWW2004" />

<hr />

<p>
One thing I've noted is how international this show is. 
Despite the U.S. location, it looks like a majority of the 
presenters and authors are from Europe or Asia. The attendees have a somewhat higher percentage of U.S. residents, but I'm still hearing 
a lot of Italian, Chinese, British 
English, and other languages in the halls.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
For the second session of the afternoon I was torn between <cite>Search Engineering I</cite> and <cite>Mixing Markup and Style for Interactive Content</cite>, so I decided based on which room had power plugs and 
wireless access. "Two of the presenters are the two blondest W3C staff members."
</p>

<p>
First up is the W3C's Stephen Pemberton on <cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/2004/Talks/05-19-steven-XForms-WWW2004/">Web Forms - XForms 1.0</a></cite>. 
XForms had more implementations on the day of release than any other W3C spec.
HTML forms are an immense success. XForms try to learn the lessons of
HTML forms.
To this end:
</p>


<ul>
	<li>They add type checking.</li>
	<li>Don't mix presentation with data and function</li>
	<li>No reliance on scripting</li>
	<li>Integrate with existing data streams</li>
	<li>Device independent: e.g. 
	  different widgets for lists depending on screen size</li>
	<li>Better for complex forms</li>
	<li>Internationalizable, especially with respect to character set 
	differences between client and server</li>
	<li>Accessible: which names go with which fields?</li>
</ul>

<p>
Look at <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">CSS Zen Garden</a> to prove you don't need to mix the document with presentation.
</p>

<img src="images/pemberton.jpg" height="366" width="512" alt="Stephen
Pemberton lecturing at WWW2004"/>

<p>
According to a study of 8,000 users,
there are only four reasons people prefer one site to another:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Good content</li>
	<li>Usability </li>
	<li>I missed one????</li>
	<li>Fresh Content</li>
</ul>

<p>
For complex forms XForms adds:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Repeating structures</li>
	<li>Wizards</li>
	<li>Multiple submissions</li>
	<li>Prefilling forms with XML data</li>
</ul>

<p>
XForms is more like an application environment.
It could be used for things like spreadsheets.
</p>

<hr />
<p>
Bert Bos is talking about <a href="http://www.w3.org/Talks/2004/0519-CSS-WWW2004/all.htm">CSS3 for Behaviors and Hypertext</a>. Should we style user interface widgets such as buttons? probably not. Users won't recognize them, and they'll be ugly.
But we might want to blend it in with the site's CSS.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.w3.org/People/Dean/">Dean Jackson</a> closes the day's talks with
 <a href="http://www.w3.org/2004/Talks/dj-www2004-mixedmarkup/">Mixed markup</a>; i.e. compound documents like an XHTML+SVG+MathML document or
XHTML+XForms. No browser can handle this, so he had to write his own for this presentation. He uses SVG as a graphics API and maps HTML into the SVG graphics. The Adobe SVG viewer 6 preview is required to display this. edd (Dumbill?) on IRC: "every year I rant that I can't see SVG, every year I'm told it'll be better :( no dice." According to Jackson, the real 
problem is authoring these compound documents, and writing a DTD for them is painful.

The W3C CSS working group has  posted the candidate recommendation of 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/CR-css3-ui-20040511">CSS3 module: Basic User Interface</a>.
According to the abstract, "CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language for describing the rendering of HTML and XML documents on screen, on paper, in speech, etc. It uses various selectors, properties and values to style basic user interface elements in a document. This specification describes those user interface related selectors, properties and values that are proposed for CSS level 3 to style HTML and XML (including XHTML and XForms). It includes and extends user interface related features from the selectors, properties and values of CSS level 2 revision 1 and Selectors specifications."
Defined properties (and property additions)
include:
</p>
   <ul>
	<li>  <code>appearance</code> </li>
	<li>      <code>content</code></li>
	<li>     <code>icon</code>  </li>

	<li>     <code>box-sizing</code>  </li>

	<li>     <code>outline</code> </li>
	<li>     <code>outline-width</code> </li>
	<li>     <code>outline-style</code> </li>
	<li>     <code>outline-color</code> </li>
	<li>     <code>outline-offset</code>  </li>


	<li>     <code>resize</code>  </li>

	<li>       <code>nav-down</code></li>
	<li>        <code>nav-left</code></li>
</ul>

        
<p>
This spec also defines these pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes:
</p>

 <ul>
	<li>       <code>:active</code></li>
	<li>        <code>:default</code></li>
	<li>        <code>:valid</code></li>

<p>
The  GEO (Guidelines, Education &amp; Outreach) Task Force of the W3C Internationalization Working Group (I18N WG)
 has published three new working drafts on 
 Authoring Techniques for XHTML &amp; HTML Internationalization:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-i18n-html-tech-bidi-20040509/">Authoring Techniques for XHTML &amp; HTML Internationalization: Handling Bidirectional Text 1.0</a> "provides advice for the use of markup and CSS to create pages for languages that use bidirectional text, such as Arabic and Hebrew. It attempts to counter many of the misunderstandings or over-complexities that currently abound. It also offers advice to those preparing content that will be localized into scripts that behave like Arabic and Hebrew."
</p></li>
	<li><p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-i18n-html-tech-char-20040509/">Authoring Techniques for XHTML &amp; HTML Internationalization: Characters and Encodings 1.0</a> " provides practical techniques related to character sets, encodings, and other character-specific matters that HTML content authors can use to ensure that their HTML is easily adaptable for an international audience. These are techniques that are best addressed from the start of content development if unnecessary costs and resource issues are to be avoided later on."</p></li>
	<li><p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-i18n-html-tech-lang-20040509/">Authoring Techniques for XHTML &amp; HTML Internationalization: Specifying the language of content 1.0</a> according to whose abstract, "Specifying the language of content is useful for a wide number of applications, from linguistically sensitive searching to applying language-specific display properties. In some cases the full application is still awaiting full development, whereas in others, such as detection of language by voice browsers, it is a necessity today. Marking up language meta information is something that can and should be done today. Without it, none of these applications can be taken advantage of." Reading this document, I notice that I've been negligent in declaring the languages of my pages. I'll start fixing that now.
</p></li>
</ul>


<p>
These documents are derived from  the  previous, monolithic
  <cite>Authoring Techniques for XHTML &amp; HTML Internationalization 1.0</cite>. "The material in that document will now be published as a number of smaller independent documents to allow for easier ongoing improvements and updates. The total number of such documents is not fixed, but will grow as material and resources become available. The title of all related documents will begin with 'Authoring Techniques for XHTML &amp; HTML Internationalization:...' and they can be found in the W3C technical reports index."

Recently I've received queries from several readers of Chinese translations of <a href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xmljava/">Processing XML with Java</a> asking why they can't get to this site (which provides errata and updates for the book, among many other things). I've now confirmed my suspicion that the Chinese government is blocking this and all other sites hosted on <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/">IBiblio</a>. I suspect <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/index.old/index.feb2003.html">IBiblio's  support for Tibetan freedom and independence</a> might have something to do with this. 
There's probably 
a way to get around the firewall, but off the top of my head I couldn't tell you how to do it; and of course even if I did, the people who need to know couldn't read it here anyway. :-(
</p>

<p>
Pointless it may be to post it here, but Bil Hays suggests, "Assuming that ibiblio is completely blocked, the best thing would be if he could get an account with shell access on any other machine in the world that isn't being blocked to china, and isn't blocking ibiblio. Then he could use ssh to that machine to build a tunnel to ibiblio, mapping a local port on his machine to port 80 on ibiblio through the intermediate server. It would be a longer round trip, tho.

If you haven't looked into this kind of thing before, I know it sounds complicated, but it's not really. I've got some theory up at &lt;<a href="http://wwwx.cs.unc.edu/help/network/info_sheets/tunneling.html">http://wwwx.cs.unc.edu/help/network/info_sheets/tunneling.html</a>&gt;."
</p>

<p>
Wes Felter and Fred Stutzman both suggested using the

             <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/iri-edit/draft-duerst-iri-07.txt">Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs)</a>.
"An IRI is a sequence of characters from the
   Universal Character Set (Unicode/ISO 10646). A mapping from IRIs to
   URIs is defined, which means that IRIs can be used instead of URIs
   where appropriate to identify resources." In other words this lets you write URLs that use non-ASCII characters such as 
http://www.libÃ©ration.fr/. The non-ASCII characters would be converted to a genuine URI using hexadecimally escaped UTF-8. For instance,
http://www.libÃ©ration.fr/ becomes http://www.lib%C3%A9ration.fr/.
There's also an alternative, more complicated  syntax to be used when the DNS doesn't allow
percent escaped domain names. However, the other parts of the IRI (fragment ID, path, scheme, etc.) always use percent escaping.
Comments are due by May 23.

At Bob DuCharme's suggestion, I've added <code>id</code> attributes to most of the elements in the <a href="oldnews/">permalink versions of these pages</a> starting with yesterday's news.
This should allow for reasonably stable, long-term linking to individual news items and parts thereof. 
There's no particular scheme for how the ID values are chosen. You'll need to view source on the page for the date's news (<em>not the main page at http://www.cafeconleche.org/</em>) to find them. 
If a page is edited during the day, the IDs might change, but they should stabilize within 24 hours of posting, and normally much faster than that. 
Even if the IDs do change when I add a new item or edit a preexisting one, 
the old IDs should still point to soemthing close to what they originally pointed to. This is very much a "worse-is-better" solution, just like the one that generates the permalink pages. 
It will solve probably 95-99% of the problem at a cost well below what a full solution would require. 
(In other words, I hacked this together in about 15 minutes instead of the days that would have been required to make the links immediately
stable.)

The W3C XML Protocol Working Group has published the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-soap12-rep-20040428/">first public working draft of SOAP Resource Representation Header</a>. In brief this proposes encoding resources such as JPEG images or other XML documents in a SOAP header. The spec provides this example:
</p>

<pre><code>&lt;soap:Envelope xmlns:soap='http://www.w3.org/2002/12/soap-envelope' 
               xmlns:rep='http://www.w3.org/2004/02/representation' 
               xmlns:xmime='@@@@'>
  &lt;soap:Header>
    &lt;rep:Representation resource='http://example.org/me.png'>
      &lt;rep:Data xmime:media-type='image/png'>
        /aWKKapGGyQ=
      &lt;/rep:Data>
    &lt;/rep:Representation>
  &lt;/soap:Header>
  &lt;soap:Body>
    &lt;x:MyData xmlns:x='http://example.org/mystuff'>
      &lt;x:name>John Q. Public&lt;/x:name>
      &lt;x:img src='http://example.org/me.png'/>
    &lt;/x:MyData>
  &lt;/soap:Body>
&lt;/soap:Envelope></code></pre>

<p>
A processor that was decoding the document
could load the PNG image referenced by the <code>img</code> element
by decoding the header
rather than making a second trip to the server. 
There might be a reson to do this, though I'm very nervous that as soon as I say that people are going to start suggesting that we changes the APIs like DOM and SAX to mnot provide the real XML. And then they'll want to stop shipping around real XML, and instead send the binary data itself, because, hey, that's what everyone's going to use anyway. 
I say this because I've seen every bit of this before. The relatively reasonable <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-soap12-xop-20040430">XOP proposal</a>, which achieves essentially the same goals but by bundling everything in a MIME envelope rather than a XML document, is now proposing exactly this. 
This may be the first step down a very slippery slope that leads right over a cliff; and at the bottom of the cliff 
XML will be shattered into a confusing mess of uninteroperable, inefficient, vendor-locked-in, patented, DRM-encumbered binary data.
</p>

<p>
Personally, I wonder if bundling everything up in a zip file wouldn't be architecturally cleaner, not to mention smaller. The big issue with that approach is that resolving the URLs (especially absolute URLs) becomes tricky, and there's no convenient place to store the URLs of the cached resources. 
But perhaps we could do this with a manifest file as in Java's JAR archive, which is really just a zip file anyway?

	href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-ws-cdl-10-20040427/">Web Services Choreography Description Language Version 1.0</a>. According to the
	abstract, 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The Web Services Choreography Description Language (WS-CDL) is an XML-based language that describes peer-to-peer collaborations of Web Services participants by defining, from a global viewpoint, their common and complementary observable behavior; where ordered message exchanges result in accomplishing a common business goal.
</p>

<p>
The Web Services specifications offer a communication bridge between the heterogeneous computational environments used to develop and host applications. The future of E-Business applications requires the ability to perform long-lived, peer-to-peer collaborations between the participating services, within or across the trusted domains of an organization.
</p>

<p>
The Web Services Choreography specification is targeted for composing interoperable peer-to-peer collaborations between any type of Web Service participant regardless of the supporting platform or programming model used by the implementation of the hosting environment.

 I have posted the <a href="http://cafeconleche.org/SAXTest/">SAX test suite</a> I talked about last week at XML Europe. 
You should read the <a href="http://cafeconleche.org/SAXTest/paper.html">paper</a> that describes the suite (and presents the results) first before attempting to run the suite, so you'll understand what's being tested and why.
This is primarily intended for developers writing SAX parsers, not for casual users. The framework is fairly rough at this point, and may require my personal help to get running.
</p>

<p>
The main result of the test is that you should be using Xerces. Xerces
isn't perfect, but it is the best SAX parser currently available, and several of the bugs I identified are already fixed in CVS, and should be available with the upcoming 2.7 release. 
</p>

<p>
One surprising result of the test was just how poor the selection 
of SAX parsers in Java really is. There are only two actively maintained parsers, Xerces and Oracle; maybe three  if you count GNU JAXP. However, GNU JAXP has serious bugs that aren't being fixed, and seem unlikely to be fixed in the near future unless a motivated new maintainer is found. Both Oracle and Xerces are heavyweight parsers which support DTD and schema validation, and many other features. They are both quite large. In particular, there is no current reliable small parser that simply parses XML documents without validating, either with or without exterrnal DTD subset support. A lot of people need such a parser, and many people who do are using either Piccolo or an &AElig;lfred derivative. However, my tests made it very obvious that Piccolo and all the &AElig;lfreds are seriously buggy, and should not be relied on. 
Furthermore, none of these are actively developed at this time,
so it's unlikely any of the bugs the tests identified will be fixed. :-(

David Megginson has released 
<a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/sax/">SAX 2.0.2</a>. 
"This mini-release is intended mainly to add support for XML 1.1 and Namespaces 1.1, including Unicode normalization.  The changes are all in features, properties, and JavaDoc, not in the actual class and method signatures; since the new features and properties are optional, existing libraries should continue to work with the new release."
New features in this release include:
</p>

<ul>
	<li> The  <code>Attributes2</code>  interface   exposes which attributes were specified in the source text, rather than defaulted through the DTD. The   <code>http://xml.org/sax/features/use-attributes2</code> is true if the parser passes  <code>Attributes2</code> objects to <code>startElement()</code>. </li>
	<li><code>DefaultHandler2</code>  extends <code>org.xml.sax.helpers.DefaultHandler</code> and additionally implements  <code>DeclHandler</code>, <code>LexicalHandler</code>, and <code>EntityResolver2</code> with do-nothing methods.</li>

	<li>   <code>EntityResolver2</code> can  provide external DTD subsets for documents that don't have one and  provides a <code>resolveEntity()</code> method with more parameters, which lets you cope with situations where the base URI of the document and the entity declaration have become mismatched.
The   <code>http://xml.org/sax/features/use-entity-resolver2</code> feature determines whether the parser will  use <code>EntityResolver2</code> methods where appropriate.</li>

	<li> The <code>Locator2</code> interface exposes the version (1.0 or 1.1) and encoding of the current entity. If it's unclear to you what this has to do with location information, you're not alone.
The   <code>http://xml.org/sax/features/use-locator2</code> feature is true if the Locator object passed to  <code>ContentHandler.setDocumentLocator()</code> supports the new <code>Locator2</code> interface. </li>

	<li>The read-only  <code>http://xml.org/sax/features/is-standalone</code> feature is true if and only if the document is  declared to be standalone</li>
	<li>The   <code>http://xml.org/sax/features/resolve-dtd-uris</code> feature can be set to false to prevent DTDHandler and DeclHandler  from absolutizing system IDs.</li>

</ul>

Day 3 of XML Europe begins with Ken Holman talking about 
"Writing Formatting Specifications for XML Documents:
A UBL Case Study." They're about 50 people in the room,
a good turnout for 9:00 A.M. 
UBL is the Universal Business Language.
This is based on what happened in the UBL Forms subcommittee.
UBL is the payload for EBXML. EBXML says how things go around, not 
what goes around. The UBL 1.0 release package 
is being assembled this week.
</p>

<p>
Jon Bosak asked Ken to write some stylesheets for UBL 1.0, but
the group didn't really know what they wanted the result documents to
contain or look like. So Ken formed a committee to design standard 
forms presentations. These are not based on <acronym title="XSL Formatting Objects">XSL-FO</acronym>, but they
do use XPath to identify the information in the documents to be displayed
in the visual representation. 
Other technologies such as PDF or PostScript could be used instead.
</p>

<p>
Ken seems to believe the visual representation
needs to be standardized, but this 
denies the value of XML. The normative document becomes the printout, not the XML. 
</p>

I just noticed something weird: I've been at this conference for 
more than two days now and I haven't yet heard anyone say the words
"architectural forms." Times have changed. 
I've had heard a lot of people saying the words "RDF", "OWL",
and "topic maps". I still don't really know what those words mean myself, but people are still saying them.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
Second talk of the morning is Klaas Bals, CTO of Inventive Designers,
a developer of Scriptura,
<acronym title="XSL Formatting Objects">XSL-FO</acronym> rendering engine,
 on "Using <acronym title="XSL Formatting Objects">XSL-FO</acronym> 1.1 for Business Type Documents."
He prefers XSLT pull (xsl:for-each, xsl:value-of) to XSLT push
(xsl:apply-templates) for business type documents, because in a business type document such as an invoice, the layout drives where the content is placed. In forms there's lots of absolute positions, 
limited if any flowing of content. 
</p>

<p>
<acronym title="XSL Formatting Objects">XSL-FO</acronym> 1.1 is a working draft that will change in the future.

The <code>absolute-position</code> property can only be applied to <code>fo:block-container</code>!?!

BarcodeML is an XML application for bar codes that can be generated
easily by XSLT. He suggests developing a ChartML for charts that would
make it easier to generate charts from XSLT, and which could be
processed by special purpose processors as MathML and SVG are processed
by MathML and SVG renderers today. It's an interesting idea. It would
certainly be easier than generating the SVG for a chart directly from
the XML data using XSLT. You perhaps could implement a renderer on top
of JFreeChart, and similar libraries. I wish I had time to work on it.
It might make a nice paper for XML 2004 in Philly in December, but I
doubt I could do it in time for the deadline. Hmm, perhaps there's
something like this built into OpenOffice or Excel? Do those products'
XML formats use a special charting vocabulary or just a generic graphics
vocabulary? I should check. He says Chrysalis has also begun work on a
charting XML application.

<p>
Back to room D and the technical track for the final two sessions of the
show. First Alex Brown is talking about "Refactoring XML." He wants to
refactor XML itself, the technology, not refactoring XML instance
documents. Oh god, he wants to talk about elements vs. attributes,
again! Hasn't everything there is to say about this already been said?
he thinks the question (which to use when) indicates a "bad smell" in
XML. I disagree. </p>

<p> DocHeads (developers who work with narrative documents) work round
XML by augmentation. DataHeads (developers who work with record-like
documents) work around XML by reduction. E.g. SOAP forbidding processing
instructions. Interesting point. It seems reasonable, and I hadn't
thought of the split that way before. </p>


<p> He suggests that XML was not intended  for human consumption based
on the XML design goals, specifically "Terseness in XML markup is of
minimal importance." "XML is verbose by design", and "XML is text, but
isn't meant to be read." I disagree. First of all he's confusing
consumption with production. Secondly, I do not think lack of terseness
is not a problem for humans. He ignored Item 3, "XML documents should be
human-legible and reasonably clear," and I can't find two of his other
quotes in the spec. OK, they're from XML in 10 Points, not the spec.  
And the idea that XML isn't 't meant to be read is almost 180&deg;
wrong. Liam Quin appears to agree with me. He makes reference to Terry
Pratchett's "Lies to Children", and suggests these goals are examples of
such "Lies to Children." See the <cite>Science of Discworld</cite>
(Great book by the way. Last I checked it wasn't available in the
States. You can order it from Amazon UK.) </p>

<p> He proposes to leave out everything from XML except tags and text:
no processing instructions, DTDs, attributes, comments, etc. He wants to
derive it from SGML rather than XML. He claims this will control
proliferation of ad hoc XML subsets, and terminate permathreads on other
formats. Then new lexical layers (non-angle brackets, short tags, SDATA
entities, etc.) can be built on top of this. However, this is only for
DataHeads, not DocHeads. The main benefit is simpler parser
implementation (in other words a non-conformant parser that doesn't
support real XML). Google Rick Jelliffe on Goldilocks and SML for a
rebuttal. </p>


<p> This is so wrong on so many levels, I don't know where to begin. I
think this talk gets the booby prize for the single worst idea of the
conference. Henry Thompson sums up, "Sorry, but no. I came with an open
mind, but I'm not convinced." </p>

<p> Interesting historical point, according to Thompson, "Tim"
(Berners-Lee? or Bray?) directly and personally rejected the original
(processing instructions?) namespaces proposal, and Eliot Kimber walked
out of the working group as a result. But in hindsight, Thompson thinks
Tim was right. He didn't at the time. </p>

<hr />
<p>
Next Mark Birbeck 
 is giving a late-breaking news presentation
  about XHTML and RDF (co-authored with Stephen Pemberton).
 The goal is a new syntax for RDF and XHTML  that would allow the two of them to integrate better. 
</p>

<ul>
	<li>HTML <code>meta</code> element's <code>name</code> attribute becomes the <code>property</code> attribute, which may appear on any element:
<p><code>&lt;span property="dc:date">January 24, 2003&lt;/span></code></p>


</li>
	<li>HTML <code>href</code> attribute becomes the <code>resource</code> attribute which can appear on any element, and make it a clickable link

<p><code>The &lt;span resource="http://www.davidbeckham.com">England captain&lt;/span>
 had his hair cut</code></p>


The right choice of URIs is necessary to make this reliable metadata.
The taxononmies are based on URIs. 

</li>
<li>Elements (not just <code>head</code>) can contain <code>link</code> and <code>meta</code> child
elements  to identify metadata about the element.</li>
<li>Add a <code>content</code> attribute. For instance this tells you which England captain (football or rugby) is referred to:

<p><code>The &lt;span content="David Beckham">England captain&lt;/span>
 had his hair cut</code></p>

</li>

<li>Adds a <code>datatype</code> attribute:
<p><code>&lt;span datatype="xsd:date">2003-01-24&lt;/span></code></p>

</li>

</ul>

<p>
 According to Pemberton, this is a snapshot of an unfinished
work in progress. The XML limitation of one ID per element is apparently
a problem that remains to be solved.
</p>

<p>
Overall, this seems interesting and it might  be helpful, but it really
doesn't do anything about the fundamental problem of getting content
publishers to provide accurate, useful metadata. Maybe that's too harsh.
This syntax would make adding metadata easier, which might expand its
use somewhat. This syntax is a lot easier to stomach than traditional
RDF syntax. Liam Quin points out that this has the problem of
QNames in element content, which makes cut and paste fragile
because you can lose the namespace declarations. 
Henry Thompson doesn't think this is such a big problem.
Liam also notes validating these XHTML documents is a problem, but I don't see that.
(Then again, I don't really care if my XHTML validates.
This page doesn't.)

Conference chair Edd Dumbill is giving the closing keynote address on 
"The State of XML." "The state of XML is pretty good." He's been told 
Microsoft writes their schemas in RELAX NG and then translates them into 
W3C XML Schema Language. He's worried about a lot of the web services specs being devloped outside the W3C (shows the Feigenbaum? Swale?, period doubling diagram) and suspects we're heading for a train wreck. He likes REST and document oriented web services. He's optimistic about XForms.
"These days we all need to be librarians."
He believes we need standard schemas and taxonomies to achieve interoperability. (I disagree.) Mobile devices (PDAs, etc.) will drive adoption of XHTML. He foresees more regulations governing the 
Web as it becomes more and more important to our daily lives. The general buzz of the conference is the human readability and editability of XML.
Over 80% of attendees (at a previous conference) used a text editor
to edit their XML. "A successful document type is a readable document type." Microsoft is starting to get this.
Illegible XML is a problem for RDF. XML syntax may not be right for all aplications (RELAX NG, RDF). He wants us to be inspired about the state of XML. His speech will be posted on xml.com tomorrow.

Memo to self: I really need to update the scripts used to edit this 
site so they use a <a href="http://www.latenightsw.com/freeware/XMLTools2/">real XML parser</a> instead of regular expressions, which don't even work on my PowerBook anyway.
The only excuse I have for this bogosity is that these scripts predate XML by a year or two.

Day 2 of XML Europe, More stream of consciousness notes from the show,
though probably fewer today since I also have to prepare for and deliver my own 
talk on SAX Conformance Testing. I'll put the notes, paper, and software

Memo to conference organizers: open wireless access at the conference is a must in 2004. If the venue won't allow this, find another venue!
</p>

<p>
Memo to conference attendees: ask the conference if they 
provide open wireless access. If the conference doesn't, find another conference!
</p>

<p>
Having wireless access radically changes the experience at the conference.
It enables many things (besides net surfing in the boring talks). 
Live note taking and Rendezvous enable the audience to communicate with each other  and comment on the talks in real time without disturbing others.
When you're curious about a speaker's point, it's easy to Google it.
Providing wireless access makes the sessions much more interactive.

The morning began with a session entitled, "Topic Maps Are Emerging. Why Should I Care?" Unfortunately the question in the title wasn't really answered in the session. I've been hearing about topic maps for years, and have yet to see what
they (or RDF, or OWL, or other similar technologies) actually accomplish.
What application is easier to write with topic maps than without?  What problem
does this stuff actually solve? All I really want to hear is one or two clear,
specific examples and use cases. So far I haven't seen one.

<p>
After some technical glitches,
Uche Ogbuji is talking about XML good practices 
and antipatterns in a talk entitled 
"XML Design Principles for Form and Function". 
Subjects include (I love these names)
</p>
<ul>
	<li>"Boochist markup": written by somebody who'd rather be writing C++ than XML</li>
	<li>"Tool Chic markup": never intended to be read by a human (e.g. WSDL)</li>
	<li>"Jeweler's markup": every single thing is marked up</li>
	<li>"Carpet tag bombs": nothing is marked up. e.g. putting 
	     an entire Java class in one <code>java</code> element</li>
	<li>"Punched-card markup"</li>
	<li>"Namespace race"</li>
</ul>

<img src="images/P1010008.jpg" alt="Uche Ogbuji at XML Europe 2004" width="512" height="384" />

<p>
He doesn't like "hump case" (camel case). 
</p>

<p>
Using attributes to qualify other attributes is a big No-No.
If you're doing this, you're swimming upstream.
You should  switch to elements.
</p>

<p>
Envelope elements (<code>company</code> contains <code>employees</code> contains <code>employee</code>; <code>library</code> contains
<code>books</code> contains <code>book</code>) makes processing easier; but not always. Use them only if they really represent something in the problem domain, not just to make life easier for the processing tools. 
</p>

<p>
Don't overuse namespaces.
He (unlike Tim Bray) likes URNs for namespaces, mostly to avoid 
accidental dereferencing. He also suggests RDDL. He suggests "namespace normal form" Declare all namespaces
at the top of the document. Do not declare two different prefixes for the same namespace. 
</p>

<p>
A very good talk. I look forward to reading the paper. 
FYI, he's a wonderful speaker; probably the best I've heard here yet.
(Stephen Pemberton and Chris Lilley were  pretty good too.)
Someone remind me to invite them to SD next year.

on "Test-Driven XML Development".
Hmm, the A/V equipment in this room seems to be giving everyone fits
today. It worked well yesterday. This
does not bode well for my presentation this afternoon.
</p>

<p>
One thing I'm noting in this and several of the other talks is 
that in a mere 45-minute session the traditional tripartite outline
structure (tell your audience what you're going to tell them, tell them, and then tell them what you told them) doesn't really work. There's not enough time to do it, nor is the talk long enough that it's necessary.
At most summarize the talk in one sentence, not even an entire slide.
In fact the title of the talk  (if it isn't too cute) is often a sufficient summary.</p>

<p>
  "XSLT gives you a really big hammer to hit yourself with."
  He suggests using Eric van der Vlist's 
  XSLTunit for writing XSLT that tests XSLT.
  Also recommends XMLUnit for the .NET folks.
  I should look at this to see if they're any good ideas
  here I can borrow  for XOM's <code>XOMTestCase</code> class.

<!-- <p>
I just realized something inspired by a comment of Michael Kay's in
my SAX Conformance Testing talk. 
This relates to a feature I considered fro XOM, and then dropped when implementation proved tricky.
A normal, non-streaming tree-based API must not return a partial tree from its parse() method.
A typical tree implementation works something like this:
</p>

<p><code>Document doc = parser.parse("http://www.example.com");</code></p>

<p>
According to the XML spec, "????".
Note the sequence here. The <code>parse()</code> method returns after
the well-formedness error has been detected. 
This is the normal path of execution. Therefore, according to spec,
it must not ????. However, it might be OK to retue

Mark Scardina, "owner" of Oracle's XML Developer Kit,
is talking about "High Performance XML Data Retrieval"
</p>
<img src="images/P1010001_1.jpg" alt="Mark Scardina, Oracle XML Product Manager" width="512" height="384" />
<p>
XPath is the preferred query language, apparently because of its broad support in different 
standards like DOM, XSLT, and XQuery.
</p>

<p>
The DOM Working Group is finished and will not be rechartered.
DOM Level 3 XPath is limited to XPath 1.0. Multiple XPath queries require
multiple tree traversals (at least in a naive, non-caching implementation -ERH). 
</p>

<p>
High performance requirements include managed memory resources, even for 
very large (gigabyte) documents. This requires streaming, 
but SAX/StAX aren't good fits.
Also need to handle multiple XPaths (i.e. XPath location paths) 
with minimum node traversals.
Knowing the XPath in advance helps. 
Will not handle situation where everything is dynamic. 
This must support both DTDs and schemas (and documents with neither).
</p>
<p>
These requirements led to "Extractor for XPath."
This is based on SAX, for streaming and multicasting support. 
First you need to register the XPaths and handlers. 
This absolutizes the XPaths. 

Then
Extractor compiles XPaths.
This requires determining whether or not the XPath is streamable.
Can reject non-streamable XPaths. It also builds a predicate table and an index tree.
</p>

 <p>
"XPath Tracking" maintains XPath state and matches document XPaths
with the indexed XPaths. XPath is implemented as a state machine 
implemented via a stack. It uses fake nodes to handle /*/ and //.
Output sends matching XPaths along with
document content. 
Henry Thompson seems skeptical of the performance of the state machine.
He thinks a ?bottom-up parser? might be much faster.
I really don't understand this. I'm just copying
Scardina's notes.

I ran all the way across the convention hall carrying my sleeping laptop,
something which I hate to do,
(Has anyone noticed that age is directly correlated to the care one takes of computer equipment?
I am amazed at how cavalierly the students at Polytechnic treat their laptops.
I suspect it involves both the cost and fragility of computers when one first learned 
to use them. At the rate we're going, children born this year will be laying hacky-sack with their
laptops in the school yard.) to catch
Sebastian Rahtz talking about 
"A Unified Model for Text Markup: TEI, DocBook, and Beyond."
The "Beyond" part includes  includes other formats like HTML and MathML. 
The main purpose of this seems to be to allow
DocBook to be used in TEI and vice versa, for elements that one has that the other has
no real equivalent; e.g. a DocBook <code>guimenu</code> element in a mainly TEI document.
This is done with RELAX NG schemas. He recommends David Tolpin's RNV parser
and James Clark's emacs mode for XML.

The first keynote is about Amazon Web Services by Amazon's Jeff Barr. 
I've been meaning to use this for some time to finally update
the books pages here on Cafe con Leche and Cafe au Lait,
but time is limited as always.
He actually defines web services as any programmatic (as opposed to human)
access to a web server so it includes REST approaches as well as SOAP.
The big difference he sees (I'm not sure this is accurate) is that
REST is preferred by weakly typed scripters (Python, XSLT)
where as SOAP is preferred by strongly typed programmers (Java, C). 
 Interesting statistic from this talk:
Amazon provides both SOAP and REST interfaces to their data. About
80% of the calls come through REST, 20% through screen scraping. 
He expected the opposite. BEEP, WSDL, etc. seem unnecessary for aggregation
of web services. The developers he sees are doing just fine without them.

Next up is Stephen Pemberton of the CWI and chair of the 
W3C HTML and Forms working group.
He's talking about notations in a generic sense,
not specifically XML NOTATION  type attributes. 
Examples include two-letter U.S. state abbreviations such as NY and FL.
<!-- e-mail him about spelling of Minnesota, not Minnisota -->
He suggests a better algorithm for this, but I don't think it would actually
work. I see several possible conflicts. As he says,
"I'm English. I just live in Holland." He recommends reading
"The Goldilocks Theories" in <cite>Tog on Interface</cite>.
People writing with WYSIWYG editors produce higher quality 
text than people typing in text editors (he says, as I type this in
BBEdit). Pen and paper is higher quality still. 
Very interesting picture that demonstrates if you buy a new computer every 18 months or more,
your current computer is more powerful than 
<em>the sum of all computers you have owned previously.</em>
"The only thing my computer has all those extra cycles for is
to make it act more like a television...so why are we devising notations to
make like easier for the computer?" I suggest that we're not so much making
it easier for computers as for programmers. Software development, programmer
skill, algorithms, etc. don't follow Moore's law. 
Hmm, seems Pemberton agrees with me. 
90% of the cost of developing software is debugging according to the DoD.
A program that's 10 times longer is 31 times harder to write according to Moore
of <cite>Mythical Man-Month</cite> fame. Therefore we should write programming languages to make life easier for the programmer rather than the computer.
This was the goal of 
ABC, Python etc. What is Lambert Meertens working on?
An order of magnitude improvement on Python/ABC?
He's complaining about the difficulty of authoring XML (and XHTML), but he's exaggerating the problem by assuming validity, XML declaration, namespaces, etc. are
 required. I think he's also overestimating the ease of writing unmarked up text
 that can be processed by a computer. I don't think computers are really going to be able to parse real unmarked up text until and unless we have real AI.
I think it's easier to write explicitly marked up text than implicitly marked up text.

Chris Lilley of the W3C is talking about Architectural Principles of the
World Wide Web. This is the first breakout session. Good crowd, about 50 people. According to Lilley, the TAG is only responsible for documenting the web architecture as it exists, not designing an architecture. 
</p>
<p>
First principle is orthogonality of specifications
is good. I agree. XML is harmed by excessive reliance on Unicode and URLs.
Big digression in the audience over why "orthogonal" is or is not the right word for this principle, but everyone agrees with the principle.
</p>

<p>
2nd principle:  "Silent  recovery from error is harmful."
Does Opera error correct XML? Claim is made in audience.
Some disagreement in audience with this principle.
</p>

<p>
Principle 3: URIs (as redefined in RFC 2396bis).
Open question  whether or not IRIs can only be written using Unicode Normalization Form C. Check the spec. 
</p>

<p>
Principle 4: URIs are compared character by character. 
</p>
<p>
Principle 5: Avoid unnecessary new URI schemes. "Making up stupid things like itunes that are exactly the same as http except they mean use my software instead of a web browser is a bad idea." Ditto for subscribe in RSS. 
</p>
<p>
Principle 6: "User agents must not silently ignore authoritative server metadata."
</p>
<p>
Principle 7: Safe interactions. GET is safe (does not incur obligations). 
POST may not be. Big issue with GET is character encoding in query strings.
This breaks search engines in countries with less-ASCII like character sets.
</p>
<p>
Principle 8: Text vs. binary. Lilley likes text. Tag finding summarizes the issue.
</p>
<p>
Principle 9: Extensibility and Versioning. Extensibility must be designed in.
Must understand vs. must ignore.
</p>
<p>
Principle 10: Separate content, presentation, and interaction.
Question from audience:
"Isn't there someone from Microsoft on the Working Group?"
</p>
<p>
Principle 11: XML and Hypertext. Allow web wide linking.
Use URIs instead of IDREFs. 
</p>
<p>
Principle 12: XML ID semantics.

<p>
Paul Prescod is talking about "Take REST: An Analysis of Two REST APIs".
He's referring to Amazon and ATOM.
I'm not sure I like the title. I suppose these are interfaces,
and can be used as interfaces to application programs, but they are not APIs in the traditional sense. They're simply a presentation of data as XML documents
at particular URLs. Hmm, seems he may have thought the same thing.
That title was from the show program, but on the slides it's morphed into
"Take REST: A Tale of Two Service Interfaces".
</p>
<p>
Prescod prefers "data-centric interfaces" to "service oriented interfaces".
"XML is the solution to the problem, not the problem." Don't hide the XML!
Big problem with Amazon interfaces is embedding authentication info in the
URIs. However, this does work better with XSLT. RPC is too fragile 
(not extensible) for wire protocols. Example: fixed length argument lists.

Michael Kay, author of the popular 
<a href="http://saxon.sourceforge.net/">Saxon</a> open source  XSLT processor, is talking about "XSLT and XPath Optimization (in Saxon)". 
There's a large crowd, more than 60 people in a small room.
"Saxon is an engineering project, not a research project."
He does not have a good performance test suite
and reproducible measurements. His technique
is mostly based on incrementally optimizing 
badly performing stylesheets. 
If he had been a reviewer his own paper, he would have complained about this.

Runtime optimizations can use knowledge of input
data. Compile time optimizations avoid cost of repeated optimization.

Differences between XSLT 1 and XSLT 2 aren't that radical from the standpoint of
optimizations.  Most optimizations in Saxon 7 could have been applied to Saxon 6
if he hadn't abandoned it. Some techniques are more effective in XSLT 2 due to strong types, but even 1.0 processors can deduce type information.

Namespace prefixes defined at runtime (often via variables) are a major pain.

Saxon does more optimization on XPath expressions than XSLT instructions.

Jonathan Robie of Data Direct
 is talking about "SQL/XML, XQuery, and Native XML Programming."
Robie expects a second last call working draft of XQuery, because of the 
significant changes still being made. "It is anticipated" that there will
be support for the SQL/XML XML data type in JDBC 4.0. 
There should be a public draft of a Java API for XQuery soon.

<p>
IBM's Elena Litani, a major contributor to Xerces-Java,
is talking about "An API to Query XML Schema Components and
the PSVI," about 20 people attending. The API she's describing is 
implemented in Xerces and has been submitted as a member proposal to the
W3C. (I don't remember seeing this there. It may be members only.
If the wireless network were working I could check.)
</p>
<img src="images/P1010004.jpg" alt="Elena Litani lecturing at XML Europe 2004" width="512" height="384" />

<p>
They wanted a platform and language independent API, defined in IDL.
Didn't the DOM prove once and for all that this was a bad idea? 
Here they don't even have the excuse of needing to run inside browsers.
</p>
<p>
The three main interfaces are <code>ElementPSVI</code>, <code>AttributePSVI</code> and their common superinterface, <code>ItemPSVI</code>. These are implemented by the same objects that implement DOM Level 3 standard <code>Element</code>, <code>Attr</code>, and <code>Node</code> interfaces (or
equivalent in other APIs). Casting is required.
</p>

<p>
 Streaming models would use a
<code>PSVIProvider</code> pull interface instead. Xerces supports this in SAX.
Cast <code>XMLReader</code> to <code>PSVIProvider</code>, and then call 
<code>getElementPSVI()</code>, <code>getAttributePSVI()</code>, etc. However not all details may be available. For instance, in <code>startElement()</code>, one doesn't yet know if the element is valid.
</p>

<p>
This all looks very closely tied to the W3C XML Schema Language.
I don't see how one could use this on a RELAX NG validated document, for example.
</p>

<p>
This API also includes a full read-only model for modelling schemas including 
<code>XSObject</code>, <code>XSModel</code>, etc for modelling element declarations, target namespaces, 
type definitions, etc. I asked what the use case for this part of the API was. 
Litani suggests comparing two schemas and a schema-aware editor.
According to Henry Thompson, it also allows you to navigate the type hierarchy; for instance to find out if a user defined type is a subtype of <code>xsd:int</code>.

"A Logical Foundation for W3C XML Schema." He admits the spec was written for
implementors, and difficult to read for ordinary users. In the future wants to better support logical reasoning about schema composition. 
He's speaking for himself as an individual, not the working group. 
He starts from the logic of feature structures as developed by Rounds, Moshier, et al. (And I'm already lost. Oh, he's going to give a mini-tutorial on what a "logic" is. Maybe this will explain it.) A <dfn>logic</dfn> is 
</p>

<ul>
	<li>A sentential form</li>
	<li>A model theory</li>
	<li>An interpretation </li>
</ul>

<p>
Gee, that's clear. OK, he elaborates. A sentential form is a grammar for defining well-formedness such as a BNF grammar. Now we're on ground I understand somewhat.
A model theory is what the sentences are about. 
It's also a set of individuals and a set of named subsets of the set.
The interpretation relates the well-formed 
sentences to the model so truth values of sentences can be determined. 
The sentences are interpreted by comparing what's found in the sentence to the items in the sets. The sentences contain logical operators such as 
OR and AND.
I think I see what he's saying. I just don't see why this is useful. 
</p>

<p>
OK, that's a logic. Now on to schemas. According to Thompson, a schema is a component graph in which components are nodes and properties are edge labels. Non-component values are leaf nodes. However, this is a general graph with circles. Unlike XML documents it is not a tree. He wants to extend XPath to support such graphs.
</p>

<p>
Now he's showing a reformulation of parts of the schema spec using logic notation. I wouldn't have thought it possible, but it's even more opaque and reader hostile than before! <!-- by the way, your problems with UTF-8 may be with supplementary plane math characters--> Maybe it makes more sense 
once you've had some time to absorb it. This does look like it may 
make life easier for implementors. I'm just not sure it's
an improvement for users. I asked, who is this meant for? 
Apparently it's supposed to  replace the normative parts of the spec, and allow the non-normative parts to be written more cleanly.
</p>

<p>
Dan Brickley wants to 
rewrite this on top of OWL (which is itself written on top of RDF) instead of 
Thompson's idiosyncratic XML.
</p>

<p>
Thompson notes that 
when originally working on the PSVI, the working
group was frustrated that there was nothing in the Infoset spec that told them how to be good citizens when extending the Infoset. 
It occurs to me that this is a problem for other specs like XInclude (which is trying to sneak a new language property into the Infoset) 
that want to extend the Infoset. Thompson claims this approach solves that problem,
but I can't tell. As he says,
"This stuff is dense." The formalization is very close to being a Prolog program, which would make an excellent reference implementation (if an
inefficient one). 
</p>

<p>
That's all for today. More tomorrow.

The W3C DOM working group has released 
the final
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-DOM-Level-3-Core-20040407">Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 Core Specification</a>
and the 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-DOM-Level-3-LS-20040407">Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 Load and Save Specification</a>.
The load and save specification defines platform and language independent means to parse an XML document to create a DOM <code>Document</code> object, and to serialize DOM <code>Document</code> objects into a file or output stream, something that was previously implementation dependent and accomplished with APIs like JAXP. 
DOM Level 3 Core adds various new features and methods to the standard DOM classes including:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Base URI support</li>
	<li>A standard bootstrapping procedure to load a <code>DOMImplementation</code> in Java by reading a <code>DOMImplementationRegistry</code></li>
	<li>A <code>DOMConfiguration</code> interface that controls lots of little fiddly details like normalization</li>
	<li>The XML declaration information such as encoding  is now available in the <code>Document</code> object</li>
	<li>User data attached to nodes</li>
	<li>You can get the whole text from a text node.</li>
	<li><code>DOMErrorHandler</code> for reporting errors (like SAX2's <code>ErrorHandler</code>)</li>
	<li><code>DOMLocator</code> interface for reporting document positions (like SAX2's <code>Locator</code>)</li>
	<li>A <code>TypeInfo</code> interface for DTDs and schemas</li>

The W3C XInclude working group has posted the second candidate recommendation of the  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/CR-xinclude-20040413">XInclude specification</a>. Substantive changes include:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The <code>accept</code> and <code>accept-language</code>
attributes  are now limited to printable ASCII characters between 0x20 and 0x7E inclusive. This closes a major security hole in the last draft. 
</li>
<li>The  <code>accept-charset</code> 
attribute has been removed. </li>
<li>The namespace URI is once again <code>http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude</code> instead of 
<code>http://www.w3.org/2003/XInclude</code></li>
<li>XInclude processors are recommended to add <code>xml:lang</code> attributes as necessary to the included elements to try to retain the language tagging. 
 </li>
<li>The prohibition on fragment identifiers has changed from a "should not" to a "must not", though the exact error behavior is not yet specified. 
 </li>
</ul>


<p>
In my opinion this draft is the best yet, and probably ready for final release. 
I still think the <code>xpointer</code> attribute is an kludge, 
but it's just ugly&mdash;it doesn't really prevent users from doing anything. I do still wish their were a profile with no XPointer support at all to better support streaming implementations. 
 Otherwise, this spec feels very solid.

The W3C XML Core Working Group has posted a note on 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/NOTE-proc-model-req-20040405/">XML Processing Model Requirements</a>.
The goal is to devlop an XML vocabulary dexcribing how to combine different processes such as XSL transformation and XInclude resolution  in a certain order for manipulating infosets.
 The requirements are as follows:
</p>

<blockquote>
 <ul>
	<li>     The language must be rich enough to address practical interoperability concerns.</li>
	

	<li>      The language should be as small and simple as possible.</li>
	

	<li>      The language must allow the inputs, outputs, and other parameters of a components to be specified.</li>
	

	<li>      The language must define the basic minimal set of mandatory input processing options and associated error reporting options required to achieve interoperability.</li>
	

	<li>      Given a set of components and a set of documents, the language must allow the order of processing to be specified.</li>
	

	<li>      It should be relatively easy to implement a conformant implementation of the language, but it should also be possible to build a sophisticated implementation that can perform parallel operations, lazy or greedy processing, and other optimizations.</li>
	

	<li>      The model should be extensible enough so that applications can define new processes and make them a component in a pipeline.</li>
	

	<li>      The model must provide mechanisms for addressing error handling and fallback behaviors.</li>
	

	<li>      The model could allow conditional processing so that different components are selected depending on run-time evaluation.</li>
	

	<li>      The model should not prohibit the existence of streaming pipelines.</li>
	

	<li>      The model should allow multiple inputs and multiple outputs for a component.</li>
	

	<li>      The model should allow any data set conforming to one of the W3C standards, such as XML 1.1, XSLT 1.0, XML Query 1.0, etc., to be specified as an input or output of a component.</li>
	

	<li>      Information should be passed between components in a standard way, for example, as one of the data sets conforming to an industry standard.</li>
	

	<li>      The language should be expressed in XML. It should be possible to author and manipulate documents expressed in the pipeline language using standard XML tools.</li>
	

	<li>      The pipeline language should be declarative, not based on APIs.</li>
	

	<li>      The model should be neutral with respect to implementation language. Just as there is no single language that can process XML exclusively, there should be no single language that can implement the language of this specification exclusively. It should be possible to interoperably exchange pipeline documents across various computing platforms. These computing platforms should not be limited to any particular class of platforms such as clients, servers, distributed computing infrastructures, etc.</li>
</ul>

The W3C XML Core Working Group has posted the first public working draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-xml-id-20040407/">xml:id Version 1.0</a>. This describes an idea that's been kicked around in the community for some time. The basic problem is how to link to elements by IDs when a document doesn't have a DTD or schema. The proposed solution is to predefine an <code>xml:id</code> attribute that 
would alays be recognized as an ID, regardless of the presence or absence of a DTD or schema. There are a few issues with the spec as currently written, which I've been sending to the working group as I discover them, but the basic idea seems solid.

The Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS) has voted to approve several 
<a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=wss">Web Services Security</a> specifications as official standards.
Of course, they won't actually tell anybody what those specifications are, and their web site seems to be down about one out of every two connection attempts; and from what one can find, it seems there was at least one major flaw in the specification as written which will have to be addressed later in an erratum; but hey, they've got some specs out, somewhere!
</p>

<p>
In my experience, OASIS is the place companies go when they want to be able to brand something as a standard without doing the hard work of verifying that it actually makes sense. OASIS does have the benefit of being much more open to individual participation than most other standards bodies, which has led a couple of smart developers to move their projects there. (RELAX NG and DocBook come to mind.) 
However, the company led projects at OASIS seem to be uniformally disastrous: big, clunky, and irrelevant.

published the first public working draft of 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-ws-chor-model-20040324/">WS Choreography Model Overview</a>. According to the introduction,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Business or other activities that involve multiple different organizations or independent processes that use Web service technology to exchange information can only be successful if they are properly coordinated. This means that the sender and receiver of a message know and agree in advance:</p><ul><li><p>The format and structure of the (SOAP) messages that are exchanged, and</p></li><li><p>The sequence and conditions in which the messages are exchanged.</p></li></ul><p>WSDL and its extensions provide a mechanism by which the first objective is realized, however, it does not define the sequence and conditions, or <em>choreography</em>, in which messages are exchanged.</p><p>To solve this problem, a shared common or "global" definition of the sequence and conditions in which messages are exchanged is produced that describes the observable complementary behavior of all the participants involved. Each participant can then use the definition to build and test solutions that conform to the global definition.</p><p>The main advantage of a global definition approach is that it separates the process being followed by an individual business or system within a "domain of control" from the definition of the sequence in which each business or system exchanges information with others. This means that, as long as the "observable" sequence does not change, the rules and logic followed within the domain of control can change at will.</p><p>The purpose of this paper is to describe an information model or "meta model" for a Choreography Definition Language that identifies the information and structures required to build a "global" definition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I don't believe these premises. I think loosely coupled systems with limited if any prior agreements work much better than systems that attempt to legislate what one does with the data one receives. 
I think any attempt to globallu define behavior is doomed to failure.

 <p> Sadly, this is not an April Fool's joke. 
The W3C has <a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/09/xmlap/xml-binary-wg-charter.html">chartered</a> an <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/Binary/">XML Binary Characterization Working Group</a> to "analyze and develop use cases and measurements for alternate
encodings of XML. Its goal is to determine if serialized binary XML
transmission and formats are feasible."
It's likely that only people who believe in binary XML will participate, which indicates the conclusion is foreordained. 
However, there are so many different conflicting  goals for binary XML (streaming, file size, bandwidth, parsing time, random access,  strong typing, direct binding of data to memory, memory footprint, high 
performance in CPU limited environments like cell phones, etc.) from the players in this space
 that it's  possible the working group won't be able to reach consensus. 
 However there's virtually no chance that "the Working Group may determine that the benefits brought by an alternate encoding of XML may not be sufficient to justify the loss of interoperability incurred."

<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-SVG12-20040318/">Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) 1.2</a>. "The SVG Working Group consider the feature set of SVG 1.2 to be approaching stability. However, there are some cases where the descriptions in this document are incomplete and simply show the current thoughts of the SVG Working Group on the feature, or list the open issues. Therefore, this document should not be considered stable." Changes since the 
fifth public draft include:
</p>


<ul>
	<li> Added support for CSS 3 Color property value rgba() syntax.</li>
	<li>Switch is dynamic; that is, constantly evaluated.</li>
	<li>Cursors  allow SVG content and animation</li>
	<li>  A new interface for filtering events such as mutations only on a particular attribute name, mouse drags, or events in a particular phase</li>
	<li> New <code>:highlight</code> pseudo-class </li>
	<li>Non Scaling Strokes</li>
	<li><code>overlay</code> and <code>overlay-host</code>  properties</li>
	<li>Methods to set and retrieve client-side data stored between sessions</li>
	<li>Removed the requiredView attribute, renamed min-pixel-width to min-unit-scale.</li>
	<li> Three new rendering hints, static, cache and snap,  for sprites</li>
	<li>The <code>traitDef</code> element allows custom attributes to be exposed to the animation engine</li>
	<li>vector-effect property.</li>

Conrad Roche has posted <a href="http://matra.sourceforge.net">Matra 0.8b</a>, an open source  Java library for parsing DTDs.
It might be useful for some purposes. However, it's divided into way too many packages, and uses short constants for no good reason that I can see. In many cases it should be using type-safe enums instead, or at least ints. Furthermore many methods are exposed as public that really shouldn't be, making the API far more complex than it needs to be. This may well be a symptom of the excessive number of packages. Matra is a read-write API. It's not immedioately clear to what extent the write side of the library maintains the syntactical correctness of DTDs. For instance, does it make sure element names are legal XML names, and does it prevent multiple declarations for the same element? 
Matra is published under the  MPL 1.1.

<p> Dennis Sosnoski has posted  <a
href="http://jibx.sourceforge.net/index.html">JiBX beta 3a</a>, yet
another  open source (BSD license) framework for binding XML data to Java
objects using your own class structures. It falls into the
custom-binding document camp as opposed to the schema driven
binding frameworks like JaxMe and JAXB.
Quoting from the JiBX web
site, </p>

<blockquote> 
 <p>JiBX is a framework for binding XML data to Java objects. It
lets you work with data from XML documents using your own class
structures. The JiBX framework handles all the details of converting
your data to and from XML based on your instructions. JiBX is designed
to perform the translation between internal data structures and XML with
very high efficiency, but still allows you a high degree of control
over the translation process.</p>
      <p>How does it manage this? JiBX uses <i>binding definition</i>

documents to define the rules for how your Java objects are converted to
or from XML (the <em>binding</em>). At some point after you've compiled
your source code into class files you execute the first part of the
JiBX framework, the <i>binding compiler</i>. This compiler enhances
binary class files produced by the Java compiler, adding code to handle
converting instances of the classes to or from XML. After running the
binding compiler you can continue the normal steps you take in assembling your
application (such as building jar files, etc.).</p>
      <p>The second part of the JiBX framework is the <i>binding
runtime</i>. The enhanced class files generated by the binding
compiler use this runtime component both for actually building objects
from an XML input document (called <i>unmarshalling</i>, in data
binding terms) and for generating an XML output document from objects
(called <i>marshalling</i>). The runtime uses a parser implementing
the XMLPull API for handling input documents, but is otherwise
self-contained.</p></blockquote>

<p>
 I heard Sosnoski talk about JiBX at SD West a couple of weeks ago. 
Overall I found it a little too inflexible for my tastes. 
It assumes a much tighter coupling between XML documents and the corresponding Java classes than I'm comfortable with. It did give me some ideas for a more flexible, loosely coupled framework I may work on in the future. 
</p>


<p>
This beta adds    bind-on-load,
optional source location tracking for unmarshalling,
custom mappings of array classes, and
custom marshallers/unmarshallers for  DOM or dom4j document models,
escaping of output characters based on encoding.

BEA Systems has posted the  final draft of Java
Specification Request (JSR) 173, <a
href="http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/final/jsr173/index.html">Streaming API for XML
(StAX)</a>, in the Java Community Process. StAX is a
Java-based, pull-parsing API for XML. StAX offers two approaches.
<code>XMLStreamReader</code> and <code>XMLStreamWriter</code> are
a cursor API designed to read and write XML as efficiently as
possible. <code>XMLEventReader</code> and
<code>XMLEventWriter</code> are an iterator API designed to be
easy to use, event based, easy to extend, and allow easy
pipelining. The iterator API sits on top of the cursor API.

BEA has published a <a href="http://dev2dev.bea.com/technologies/stax/index.jsp">reference implementation</a>.
I haven't had time to write code with it yet, or to test the

is the cleanest, most XML conformant pull parser I've seen to
date. It's definitely a substantial improvement on XMLPULL.
  Overall, this looks like a very nice API.

I'm back from Software Development 2004 West, where a good time was had by all.
I  got some interesting ideas about data binding APIs during Dennis Sosnoski's talk about JAXB and JiBX. I think I see now how to design a data binding API that doesn't suffer from the numerous problems of the existing schema dependent, tightly coupled systems. More on that after I get XOM out the door. I'm currently hoping to post alpha 1 around the first of next month. Speaking of <a href="xom/">XOM</a>, it got a very positive reception at the conference; and a few more groups are likely to start using it. 
</p>


<p>
During my talk on <cite>Effective XML</cite>, I
recommended that developers always use a parser to handle XML, because regular expressions aren't sufficiently aware of XML rules. I really should follow my own advice. The regex based software I use to update this site from home just broke because of some well-formed changes I made to attribute order while hand editing the site in Santa Clara last week. The only excuse I have is that the software for managing this site predates XML by a year or two. It certainly would be more reliable and less flaky if I took the time to rewrite it to use an XML parser, though. 
I'll be catching up on news from the last week over the day as I wade through my e-mail backlog.

IBM's alphaWorks has released an
<a href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/xqnsta">XQuery Normalizer and Static Analyzer (XQNSTA)</a>.
"Given an XQuery expression, the tool uses the normalization rules specified in the W3C XQuery Formal Semantics document to convert the given expression to an expression in a core grammar (a subset of the XQuery grammar). The tool also comes with a parser that gives an XML representation of the XQuery expression; this XML representation can be used for manipulating the expression.
Given a normalized expression, the tool again uses the static typing rules specified in the W3C XQuery Formal Semantics document to determine the output type of the expression. The normalized expression can be obtained from the Normalizer, and the static type of the expression can be obtained from the Static Analyzer. The Static Analyzer also checks for semantic errors (such as passing an empty expression to a function call where an integer argument is expected) and generates error messages whenever semantic errors are found during the static type checking."
XQNSTA is written in Java.
There's both an API for this and a GUI interface.

With a great deal of effort, I've managed to push out one more release of <a href="XOM/">XOM</a>, my tree-based streaming API for processing XML with Java, before I leave. I had hoped that this would be alpha 1 and I could declare the API frozen. However, a few too many good ideas were submitted at the last minute to ignore, so I thought I'd make one more development release to shake out any bugs in the new classes and methods.  So herewith is XOM 1.0d25.
Anything that didn't change since the last release is probably not going to change now.
However, there are some new features in this release that are worth reviewing
and are not necessarily stable:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>All 21 protected <code>check<i>Foo</i></code> methods have been removed. 
      Instead the various mutator methods (setters and other methods that change the
       state of an object) are now non-final so they can be overridden.
      The getter methods are stil final and the fields are all private.
      Thus to change the state of an object setter methods  
      still need to call the
      constraint-verifying superclass methods. 
       This should give subclasses a lot more flexibility while not 
       compromising on well-formedness. (I'm not sure why I didn't think of this a year and a half ago. I suspect I was too focused on the way JDOM did things, and incorrectly assuming that the only way to make 
setters non-final was to expose the fields as well. Clearly that's not true, but sometimes when you get a wrong idea in your head, it's really hard to shake it. It took an offhand remark from John Cowan about JavaDoc comments to make me realize that I didn't really 
need to expose the fields just because the methods that wrote to them were overrridable.)</p>

       </li>
 <li><p>The <code>Serializer</code> now throws  <code>UnavailableCharacterException</code>,
 a subclass of <code>XMLException</code>, instead of a raw <code>XMLException</code>
 when it encounters a character it can neither write nor escape in the current encoding.
  </p>
       </li>

              <li><p><code>NodeFactory.makeDocument</code> has been renamed <code>startMakingDocument</code>.
<code>NodeFactory.endDocument</code> has been renamed <code>finishMakingDocument</code>.</p></li>

<li><p><code>DOMConverter</code> can convert a <code>DocumentFragment</code> to a <code>Nodes</code>.</p></li>

<li><p>Added an <code>XSLTransform.toDocument()</code> method that converts a <code>Nodes</code> to
a <code>Document</code>.</p></li>

<li><p><code>Element.removeChildren()</code>
  now returns a <code>Nodes</code> object containing the children removed.</p></li>

<li><p>The <code>LeafNode</code> class has been removed. <code>DocType</code>, <code>Text</code>, <code>Comment</code>, and <code>ProcessingInstrcution</code>
now directly extend <code>Node</code>.</p></li>

<li><p>Removed the <code>hasChildren</code> method from <code>Element</code>, <code>Node</code>, <code>ParentNode</code>, <code>Attribute</code> and <code>Document</code>.</p></li>

<li><p><code>Element.addAttribute</code> is declared to throw the more specific <code>MultipleParentException</code> instead of 
<code>IllegalAddException</code></p></li>

The W3C Cascading Style Sheets working group has posted the first public working draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-css3-reader-20040224">The CSS 'Reader' Media Type</a>. "'Reader' is a keyword for use in Media Queries <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-css3-reader-20040224/#MEDIAQ">[MEDIAQ]</a>. When a Media Query that includes the 'reader' keyword is attached to (a link to) a style sheet, it indicates that that style sheet is designed to be used by a "reader" device (typically a screen reader), that both displays and speaks a document at the same time. It may also display the document and render it in braille at the same time, or do all three."

The W3C Cascading Style Sheets working group has posted the first public working draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-css3-hyperlinks-20040224">CSS3 Hyperlink Presentation Module</a>. " This specification is a module of level 3 of CSS and contains the functionality required to describe the presentation of hyperlink source anchors and the effects of hyperlink activation." The draft includes this convenient summary of the four properties it defines:
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>target-name</strong>: <em>current</em>

| root | parent | new | modal | &lt;string&gt;</li>

<li><strong>target-new</strong>: <em>window</em> |
tab | none</li>

<li><strong>target-position</strong>:
<em>above</em> | behind | front | back</li>

<li><strong>target</strong>: &lt;target-name&gt; || &lt;target-new&gt; ||
&lt;target-position&gt;</li>
</ul>

<p>
These properties are long overdue. The equivalent HTML markup was deprecated some years ago, but there was effetcively no other way to specify where a link would load.

<p> The W3C Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines Working Group has posted the fourth public working
draft of <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-WCAG20-20040311/">Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</a>. Quoting from the introduction:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
This document outlines design principles for creating accessible Web content. When these principles are ignored, individuals with disabilities may not be able to access the content at all, or they may be able to do so only with great difficulty. When these principles are employed, they also make Web content accessible to a variety of Web-enabled devices, such as phones, handheld devices, kiosks, network appliances. By making content accessible to a variety of devices, that content will also be accessible to people in a variety of situations.
</p>

<p>
The design principles in this document represent broad concepts that apply to all Web-based content. They are not specific to HTML, XML, or any other technology. This approach was taken so that the design principles could be applied to a variety of situations and technologies, including those that do not yet exist.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The table of contents provides a very nice summary of the guidelines:
</p>

   <ul>
     <li>

               Principle 1: Content must be perceivable.
               <ul>
                  <li> 	Guideline 1.1 For non-text content, provide text equivalents that serve the same purpose 
or convey the same information as the non-text content, except when the sole 
purpose of the non-text content is to create a specific sensory experience 
(for example, music and visual art) in which case a text label or description 
is sufficient.
                  </li>
                  <li> 	Guideline 1.2 Provide synchronized media equivalents for time-dependent  presentations.

                  </li>
                  <li> 	Guideline 1.3 Ensure that information, functionality, and structure are separable from presentation.
                  </li>
                  <li> 	Guideline 1.4 In visual presentations, make it easy to distinguish foreground words and images from the background.
                  </li>
                  <li> 	Guideline 1.5 In auditory presentations, make it easy to distinguish foreground speech and sounds from background sounds. [level 2 guideline] 									</li>

               </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
               Principle 2: Interface elements in the content must be operable.
               <ul>
                  <li> 	Guideline 2.1 Make all functionality operable via a keyboard or a keyboard interface.
                  </li>

                  <li> 	Guideline 2.2 Allow users to control time limits on their reading or interaction unless specific real-time events or rules of competition make such control impossible.
                  </li>
                  <li> 	Guideline 2.3 Allow users to avoid content that could cause photosensitive epileptic seizures.
                  </li>
                  <li> 	Guideline 2.4 Facilitate the ability of users to orient themselves and move within the content.  [level 2 guideline] 									</li>

                  <li> 	Guideline 2.5 Help users avoid mistakes and make it easy to correct them. [level 2 guideline] 									</li>
               </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
               Principle 3: Content and controls must be understandable.
               <ul>

                  <li> 	Guideline 3.1 Ensure that the meaning of content can be determined.
                  </li>
                  <li> 	Guideline 3.2 Organize content consistently from "page to page" and make interactive components behave in predictable ways.
                  </li>
               </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
               Principle 4: Content must be robust enough to work with current and future technologies. 
               <ul>
                  <li> 	Guideline 4.1 Use technologies according to specification.
                  </li>
                  <li> 	Guideline 4.2 Ensure that user interfaces are accessible or provide an accessible alternative(s)

The W3C XML Schema Working Group has published the second working draft of
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-xmlschema-ref-20040309/">XML Schema: Component Designators</a>. 
This spec proposes a scheme for naming and 
identifying  XML Schema
components. Such  components include: </p>

<ul> <li>Simple and complex type definitions</li>
<li>Attribute
declarations</li>
<li>Element declarations</li>
<li>Attribute and
model group definitions</li>
<li>Identity-constraint
definitions</li>
<li>Notation declarations</li>
<li>Annotations</li>
<li>Model groups</li>
<li>Particles</li>
<li>Wildcards</li>
<li>Attribute uses</li>
<li>The master schema
component representing the schema as a whole.</li>
<li>Facets</li> </ul>

<p> The goal is to be able to name, for example, the
literallayout notation in the DocBook schema, as well as every
other significant piece of the schema. Neither qualified names
nor URIs obviously solve this problem. </p>

Michael Kay has released <a href="http://saxon.sourceforge.net/saxon7.9/index.html">Saxon
7.9</a>, an experimental open source implementation of large
parts of XSLT 2.0, XPath 2.0, and XQuery in Java. According to Kay, version 7.9 "is not yet the schema-aware version, but it contains the structural changes needed to prepare the way for schema awareness. It kills all known bugs, and fills in a number of gaps in the coverage of the XSLT 2.0 and XQuery 1.0 specifications."
Java 1.4 is required.
Saxon is published under the Mozilla Public License 1.0.
However, a "schema-aware version of the product is planned: this will be a commercial product available from Saxonica Limited."

Nicholas Cull has posted a beta of <a href="http://mod-xhtml-neg.sourceforge.net/">mod_xhtml_neg</a>, an 
Apache module that does content negotiation for XHTML pages.
In other words, it serves XHTML pages to Internet Explorer
using the MIME media type text/html and to browsers that actually follow the standards using application/xhtml+xml.
(Actually, it looks quite a bit more powerful than that, but this seems to be the main purpose.)

Sun has released the
<a href="http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/final/jsr172/index.html">J2ME Web Services Specification</a>.
 This describes a subset of JAXP and  JAX-RPC intended for talking to SOAP services from Java 2 Micro Edition devices.
"The goal of this optional package is to define a strict subset wherever possible of the
XML parsing functionality defined in JSR-063 JAXP 1.2 [2] that can be used on the
Java 2 Micro Edition Platform (J2ME)". 
</p>

<p>
 There are major problems in the SAX subset. Sun is using the confusing, underspecified <code>SAXParser</code> and <code>SAXParserFactory</code> classes instead of the much cleaner, better specified <code>XMLReader</code> and <code>XMLReaderFactory</code> classes. They've also removed <code>ContentHandler</code> completely and replaced it with <code>DefaultHandler</code>. This 
requires altering signatures in JAXP and makes it substantially more difficult to port standard SAX programs to J2ME.
</p>

<p>
If Sun really finds true SAX to be inappropriate for a micro environment, then they're free to develop their own API that better fits the needs of small devices.  And indeed they're doing exactly that with the <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=173">StAX API</a>.
Thus it's completely unclear to me why they felt the need to fork SAX in this fashion. 
They keep claiming SAX is too big, but if size were really the concern, I'd expect them to limit themselves to one API for this use case rather than two.

	<p> The W3C Multimodal Interaction Working Group has published
	the second public working draft of the <a
	href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-InkML-20040223/">Ink Markup
	Language</a>. According to the abstract, </p>

	<blockquote> The Ink Markup Language serves as the data format for representing ink entered with an electronic pen or stylus. The markup allows for the input and processing of handwriting, gestures, sketches, music and other notational languages in Web-based (and non Web-based) applications. It provides a common format for the exchange of ink data between components such as handwriting and gesture recognizers, signature verifiers, and other ink-aware modules.
 </blockquote>

<p>
The following example of writing the word "hello" in InkML is given in the spec:
</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ink>
   &lt;trace>
     10 0 9 14 8 28 7 42 6 56 6 70 8 84 8 98 8 112 9 126 10 140

&lt;/ink></code></pre>


<p>
  &lt;sarcasm>Gee, that's not the least bit opaque.&lt;/sarcasm>.
  This looks like the SVG mistake all over again. I wrote about this in 
  Item 11 of <cite><a href="books/effectivexml/">Effective XML</a></cite>, 
  "<a href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/effectivexml/chapters/11.html">Make Structure Explicit through Markup</a>.". 
  The right way to solve this problem is something like this:
  </p>

<pre><code>&lt;ink>
  &lt;trace>
    &lt;coordinate>&lt;x>10&lt;/x> &lt;y>0&lt;/y>&lt;/coordinate>

    &lt;coordinate>&lt;x>93&lt;/x> &lt;y>205&lt;/y>&lt;/coordinate>
  &lt;/trace>
&lt;/ink></code></pre>

  
  
  <p>
  	That's more verbose, but it's also much clearer. It would let
	  the data be extracted with standard XML tools rather than
	  requiring each user to write their own micro-parser for the
	  <code>trace</code> elements. If InkML really can't afford to
	  actually markup the x and y coordinates as x and y
	  coordinates instead of raw text, then one wonders why it's
	  using XML at all?

As usually happens once I announce one of my books here, Amazon completely sold out their initial shipment of the <cite>XML 1.1 Bible</cite> as soon as it arrived at their warehouses. The publisher is shipping them more, and it should be available very soon.
It should not take the "3 to 5 weeks" Amazon is currently listing on their web site before more copies arrive. 
In the meantime, I've posted the usual five sample chapters:
</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="books/bible3/chapters/ch15.html">Chapter 15: XSL Transformations</a></li>
      <li><a href="books/bible3/chapters/ch16.html">Chapter 16: XSL Formatting Objects</a></li>
      <li><a href="books/bible3/chapters/ch17.html">Chapter 17: XLinks</a></li>
      <li><a href="books/bible3/chapters/ch18.html">Chapter 18: XPointers</a></li>
      <li><a href="books/bible3/chapters/ch20.html">Chapter 20: Schemas</a></li>
    </ul>

<p>
The XPointers chapter has changed the most since the Gold edition to bring it in line with the final XPointer recommendations, but the other four chapters have been cleaned up and rewritten as well.
</p>

<p>
These were all originally written using Wiley's rather unusual Word stylesheet. (For instance, inline code is identified with strike through rather than monospace.) I cleaned that up some in Word, then saved the files as HTML, and finally did a lot of grepping to try to clean up Word's horrific HTML; but it's still pretty ugly and malformed
if you view source.  If you notice anything that seems out of sorts formatting wise when reading these chapters, please drop me a line and I'll try to clean it up by hand.

<a href="books/bible3/xml11biblecoverlarge.jpg"> <img align="left" src="images/xml11biblecoversmall.jpeg" alt="XML 1.1 Bible Cover" width="100" height="126" hspace="7" vspace="5" border="0" /></a>
<p>
I am very pleased to announce the release of the <cite><a href="books/bible3/">XML 1.1 Bible</a></cite>, the first book  to dedicated to the new version of the 
XML standard released by the W3C less than a month ago. 
XML 1.1 has a number of features
that make it much more suitable for use by people whose operating system is MVS or VM/CMS or whose native language is  Amharic, Burmese, or Cambodian. That doesn't describe you?  Then to be honest there really isn't much in XML 1.1
to interest you, which is why the <cite>XML 1.1 Bible</cite> is quite clear in its recommendation that most users should stick to XML 1.0 for the foreseeable future. 
</p>

<p>
However, although the new edition of this bestselling work is titled the
<cite>XML 1.1 Bible</cite>, I didn't stop with the relatively minor changes needed to make it 1.1 savvy. A number of other sections were updated as well including the chapters on XPointers, Schemas, CSS, and XHTML. Most importantly,
the book was substantially reduced in size and price.
The last edition topped out at 1600 pages and cost almost $70.
This edition cuts both the size and the price by almost half. The <cite>XML 1.1 Bible</cite> should strain neither your back nor your wallet. It comes in at a little over 1000 pages, and just under $40 (on top of which Amazon and other booksellers are currently offering it for 30% off).
</p>

<p>
How did I manage such a radical reduction in size? As the French philosopher and mathematician Blaise Pascal once wrote, "I have only made this longer because I have not had the time to make it shorter." I know how he felt. The first edition of the <cite>XML Bible</cite> was written under great time pressure, was finished well after deadline, and was the largest book I had written up to that point. My favorite reader comment about that edition was, "It would seem to me that if you asked the author to write 10,000 words about the colour blue, he would be able to do it without breaking into a sweat." While I probably could write 10,000 words about blue, for this edition, I restrained myself and took the time to write more concisely. I rewrote the book from the ground up; and while I retained the basic flavor and outline that proved so popular with the last three editions, I tightened up the writing and cut many examples down to size. With the benefit of five years of hindsight, I have also been able to expand coverage of promising new technologies (schemas, XInclude, XHTML, SVG, XML Base, and RDDL) while eliminating coverage of applications that proved to be less useful than they initially appeared (WML, VML, CDF, HTML+TIME, RDF, aural style sheets, and so on). The result is a more concise, approachable volume that covers more of what you need to know and less of what you donât. If you liked the first or second edition, youâre going to like the third edition even more. Iâm confident youâll find this an even more useful tutorial and reference.
</p>

<p>
One change deserves special note. The baseball examples are history.
They've been replaced throughout by a shorter, more approachable
XML application involving television listings that I hope is a little less offputting to European audiences and other non-baseball fans. The baseball examples  were a real dividing line among readers. You either loved them or hated them. I'm hopeful that the new television examples in this edition will be somewhat less controversial. If nothing else, they are certainly shorter. 
</p>

<p>
Should you buy the new edition? If you already have the second or Gold edition,  probably not. There's not a lot of new material here. Besides bringing the coverage of a few specs like XML itself and XPointer up to date, the main focus of this revision was
to make the whole subject more approachable and accessible for novices. 
If you're still tooling around with a dog-eared copy of the first edition, it may be time to replace it. However, the second and Gold editions are still pretty up-to-date on most topics, and will continue to serve you well. On the other hand, if you're just learning XML, or if you're looking for a book to recommend to a colleague or to use as a text for a class, then I think the <cite>XML 1.1 Bible</cite> is better than ever. It covers the basics with more depth and detail, with fewer digressions into the more obscure parts of 
XML. 
The price has been reduced to just $39.99, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0764549863/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/">Amazon</a> has it on sale for just $27.99. 
They aren't showing it in stock yet, but my publisher assures me it 
has been shipped and will be arriving at their warehouses very soon. 
Enjoy, and Happy XML 1.1!

Ed Willink has posted 
<a href="http://nicexsl.sourceforge.net">NiceXSL</a>,
"a conventional textual representation of XSL that is more amenable to conventional editing. XML overheads are much reduced and abbreviated syntaxes are provided for all XSLT 2.0 constructs.
NiceXSL is supported by translators to and from standard XSLT."
He offers the following example:
</p>

<pre><code>stylesheet version="17.0" {
  match (/) {
    if (system-property('xsl:version') >= 17.0)
      &lt;xsl:exciting-new-17.0-feature>;
    else {
      &lt;html
        &lt;head
          &lt;title "XSLT 17.0 required">
        >
        &lt;body
          &lt;p "Sorry, this stylesheet requires XSLT 17.0.">
        >
      >
    }
  }
}</code></pre>


<p>
Honestly, I don't think this is as clear as the usual XML syntax for XSLT. I understand to the desrie to move the control structures out of 
XML syntax, but why can't the literal result elements be XML? This sort of malformed, pseudo-XML markup is just plain confusing. :-(

C. The API is based on SAX2. Parsifal doesn't yet catch all the well-formedness errors it should, but unlike a lot of so-called fast  parsers the author does seem to realize this is important, and is working on fixing the problems. 
I can't recommend this parser just yet, but by the time it hits 1.0, it may be worthy addition to the C programmer's toolbox.  
Version 0.74  adds support for linking with GNU libiconv so that it

The XML Protocol Working Group has posted the first public working draft of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-xop10-20040209/">XML-binary Optimized Packaging (XOP) specification</a>. 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
 This specification defines the XML-binary Optimized Packaging (XOP) convention, a means of more efficiently serializing XML Query 1.0 and XPath 2.0 Data Model [XML Query Data Model] that have certain types of content.
</p>

<p>
A XOP package is created by placing a serialization of the XML Data Model inside of an extensible packaging format (such as MIME Multipart/Related, see [RFC 2387]) and then re-encoding selected portions of its content alongside it, while marking their locations in the XML with a special element that links to the packaged data using URIs.
</p>

<p>
Optimization in XOP is limited to the content of those elements which contain characters that can be interpreted as the canonical lexical representation of the XML Schema base64Binary datatype (see [XML Schema Part 2] 3.2.16 base64Binary and Errata in XML Schema, E2-54). Attributes, non-base64-compatible character data, and data not in the canonical representation of the base64Binary datatype cannot be successfully optimized by XOP.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Fortunately, this does not seem to be a generic binary encoding of XML, just a more efficient means of bundling non-XML binary data with XML documents.  
</p>
<hr />
<p>
The XML Protocol Working Group has also posted a new working draft of the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-soap12-mtom-20040209/">SOAP Message Transmission Optimization Mechanism</a> that relies on XOP. 
Quoting from the introduction, 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
 Unlike SOAP itself, which is defined in terms of XML Infosets [XML InfoSet], this feature models message envelopes using the XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0 Data Model [XML Query Data Model], which is a typed superset of the Infoset. This feature uses type information only for optimization purposes; it does not provide for reconstruction of type information at receivers, except as necessary to support optimization. Nonetheless, use of the Data Model in this specification facilitates optimized transmission of query results through SOAP, and should provide a useful foundation if, for example, digital signature canonicalizations were to be developed for Data Model instances. Use of the Data Model here should also facilitate the work of those who may wish to develop features to provide for optimized transmission of the full typed Data Model: the changes needed to this specification should be straightforward, and the optimizations provided herein should be easy to generalize for such use.
</p>

<p>
The usage of the Abstract Transmission Optimization Feature is a hop-by-hop contract between a SOAP node and the next SOAP node in the SOAP message path, providing no mandatory convention for optimization of SOAP transmission through intermediaries. The feature does provide optional means by which binding implementations MAY choose to facilitate the efficient pass-through of optimized data contained within headers or bodies relayed by an intermediary (see 2.3.4 Binding Optimizations at Intermediaries). Additional specifications might also be written to provide for other optimized multi-hop capabilities, perhaps building on the mechanisms provided herein.
</p>

<p>
The second part (3. An Optimized MIME Multipart Serialization of SOAP Messages) describes an Optimized MIME Multipart Serialization of SOAP Messages implementing the Abstract Transmission Optimization Feature in a binding independent way. This implementation relies on the [XOP] format.
</p>

The third part (4. HTTP Transmission Optimization Feature) uses this Optimized MIME Multipart Serialization of SOAP Messages for describing an implementation of the Abstract Transmission Optimization Feature for the SOAP 1.2 HTTP binding (see [SOAP Part 2] 7. SOAP HTTP Binding).

I find the string typing implicit in this model to be seriously broken.
It loses information (i.e. it's a lossy compression format) and makes too many assumptions about what content is and is not relevant.

The Apache Project has released  <a href="http://cocoon.apache.org/2.1/">Cocoon 2.1.4</a>, an open source "web development framework built around the concepts of separation of concerns and component-based web development.
Cocoon implements these concepts around the notion of 'component pipelines', each component on the pipeline specializing on a particular operation. This makes it possible to use a Lego(tm)-like approach in building web solutions, hooking together components into pipelines without any required programming."
 Cocoon can assemble data from many sources including filesystems, SQL databases, LDAP, native XML databases, and SAP. It can customize the output to generate HTML, WML, PDF, SVG, and RTF from the same inputs. 
Processes it supports include XSL transformation and XInclude resolution. 
Cocoon can run as a servlet inside an existing web server or
 standalone through a commandline interface. 2.1.4 is primarily a bug fix release.

<p> The W3C Resource Description Framework (RDF) Core Working
Group has published six  proposed recommendations.
This set of six replaces the original two Resource Description Framework specifications from 1999, RDF Model and Syntax and RDF Schema.
The six new specs are:
 </p>

<dl> 
<dt><a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-rdf-primer-20040210/">RDF
Primer</a></dt> 
<dd> According to the introduction, RDF 
<blockquote>
<p>
The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a language for representing information about resources in the World Wide Web. It is particularly intended for representing metadata about Web resources, such as the title, author, and modification date of a Web page, copyright and licensing information about a Web document, or the availability schedule for some shared resource. However, by generalizing the concept of a "Web resource", RDF can also be used to represent information about things that can be identified on the Web, even when they cannot be directly <em>retrieved</em> on the Web. Examples include information about items available from on-line shopping facilities (e.g., information about specifications, prices, and availability), or the description of a Web user's preferences for information delivery.
</p>

<p>
RDF is intended for situations in which this information needs to be processed by applications, rather than being only displayed to people. RDF provides a common framework for expressing this information so it can be exchanged between applications without loss of meaning. Since it is a common framework, application designers can leverage the availability of common RDF parsers and processing tools. The ability to exchange information between different applications means that the information may be made available to applications other than those for which it was originally created.
</p>

<p>
RDF is based on the idea of identifying things using Web identifiers (called <dfn>Uniform Resource Identifiers</dfn>, or <dfn>URIs</dfn>), and describing resources in terms of simple properties and property values. This enables RDF to represent simple statements about resources as a <dfn>graph</dfn> of nodes and arcs representing the resources, and their properties and values.
</p>

<blockquote>   The OWL Web Ontology Language is designed for use by applications that need to process the content of information instead of just presenting information to humans. OWL facilitates greater machine interpretability of Web content than that supported by XML, RDF, and RDF Schema (RDF-S) by providing additional vocabulary along with a formal semantics. OWL has three increasingly-expressive sublanguages: OWL Lite, OWL DL, and OWL Full.</blockquote>

Who else noticed that the <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,62239,00.html">latest Microsoft security hole</a> 
was really an bug in their ASN.1 implementation? 
In theory text and binary formats are isomprophic and equivalent. In practice text formats 
in general (and XML formats in particular) are simpler, easier-to-use, easier-to-debug and less prone to security problems. 
Also of note was that it took Microsoft six months to fix this problem. 
Somehow I suspect that even if a security hole were found in Xerces or libxml, it wouldn't take their vendors half a year before releasing a patch.

I warned them that it was going to cause massive problems for numerous people.
I warned them that <a href="http://diveintomark.org/xml/rss.xml">clueless users</a> were going to start typing <code>version="1.1"</code> for no good reason, and thereby making their documents uninteroperable with most of the installed
base of XML software. But they went ahead and released it anyway, and now my prophecies have come to pass.

 The 3rd edition of XML 1.0 and the second ediiton of the XML Infoset
 just incorporate errata. Namespaces in XML 1.1 allows prefixes to be undeclared.
That is, you can now say <code>xmlns:pre=""</code>. 
Everything you need to know about XML 1.1 can be summed up in two rules:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>Don't use it.</li>
	<li>(For experts only) If you speak Mongolian, Yi, Cambodian, Amharic, Dhivehi, Burmese or a very few other languages and you want to write your markup (not your text but your markup) in these languages, then you can set the version attribute of the XML declaration to 1.1. Otherwise, refer to rule 1.</li>

Release early and release often. Wolfgang Hoschek uncovered a nasty bug in the new <code>Verifier</code> code that prevented it from working in multi-classloader environments such as servlet containers, so I've posted <a href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/XOM/">XOM 1.0d24</a> to fix the problem. So far the fix has only been tested in Tomcat 4, but it seems to work. 
I also took the opportunity to fix bugs that were causing a couple of test cases to fail on Windows, fixed a bad bug in the <code>FibonacciServlet</code> sample that was 
failing to add child elements to the root element, and improved the API documentation for several classes. The API is unchanged since yesterday. XOM is still in last call.

<p>
I am pleased to announce the release of <a href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/XOM/">XOM 1.0d23</a>, my open source, dual streaming/tree-based API for processing XML with Java.
XOM is quite parsimonious with memory, far more so than most competing tree-based APIs, and it is the most "XML correct" of any of the 
major tree-based APIs for processing XML. XOM is fanatical about maintaining well-formedness at all times. I also suspect XOM is more code correct than
most libraries for processing XML. It has an extensive unit test suite that achieves approximately 90% code coverage. The XOM tests have actually exposed numerous bugs in other libraries including Xerces, Crimson, Oracle, Piccolo, libxml, JDOM, Saxon, and more. (This weekend's 2.6.1 release of Xerces did fix the last two bugs XOM's unit tests were tripping over, so that is the preferred 
parser for XOM.)
</p>

<p>
This is the <strong>*LAST CALL*</strong> development release of XOM 1.0.  The next release will be 1.0 alpha 1, at which point I will declare API freeze and rule out gratuitous, backwards incompatible changes in the API until at least 2.0 (at some point in the indefinite future). If there are any method names or signatures that bother you in XOM, now is the time to let me know.  I do plan some future releases, 1.0.1, 1.1, 1.2, etc. to add features and improve performance. However, I don't want to change the existing API after alpha 1 without a very good reason. 
</p>

<p>
There are several big changes in this release. 
Some programs will need minor modifications to compile and run against the new release.
Most notably, the various <code>makeNode()</code> methods in the <code>NodeFactory</code> class all return <code>Nodes</code> objects. This means a factory can replace one node type with a different node type (e.g. changing elements into attributes and vice versa) or replace a single node with several nodes.
</p>

<p>
In addition, I fiddled with the exception hierarchy to try to rationalize it. 
<code>IllegalDataException</code> and its subclasses have <code>getData</code> and <code>setData</code> methods to get and set the exact text that caused the exception. Subclasses include <code>IllegalNameException</code>, <code>IllegalTargetException</code>, and <code>IllegalCharacterDataException</code>. <code>IllegalCharacterDataException</code> is now used where <code>IllegalDataException</code> was used previously.
Furthermore, 
<code>NamespaceException</code> has been broken up. <code>IllegalNameException</code> is used for problems with a namespace prefix. <code>MalformedURIException</code> is used for problems with a namespace URI. <code>NamespaceConflictException</code>, a subclass of <code>WellformednessException</code>, is used for cases where attributes, elements, and/or additional namespace declarations have conflicting bindings for the same prefix.
</p>

<p>
The <code>nu.xom.xinclude</code> package supports
now the November 2003 Working Draft syntax of XInclude, including the <code>xpointer</code>, <code>accept</code>, <code>accept-charset</code>, and <code>accept-language</code> attributes. Documents will need to be rewritten to use the new syntax. 
</p>

<p>
All legacy JDOM code has been replaced. The XOM code base is now completely independent of JDOM. (There never was much JDOM code in the first place, just parts of the <code>Verifier</code> class; but these parts have now all been replaced with different, faster  algorithms based on table lookup.)

The XML Apache Project has released version 2.6.1 of 
<a href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces2-j/">Xerces-J</a>, the popular open source
XML parser for Java that supports SAX and DOM. 
New features in this release
include
</p>

<ul>
	<li>XML Catalogs</li>
	<li>Well-formedness checking for LSSerializer</li>
	<li>Xerces can be built on Mac OS X with Apple JDK 1.4</li>
	<li>Supports the November 2003 XInclude syntax, except for XPointers</li>
</ul>

<p>
This release also fixes a number of bugs, including a couple that were bedeviling XOM. Most importantly, default atttribute values in invalid documents
are now correctly reported by SAX. This is probably the last release that will support Java 1.1. Xerces 2.7 will require Java 1.2 or later.

The W3C HTML Working Group has published the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/CR-xhtml-print-20040120/">XHTML-Print candidate recommendation</a>. According to the abstract, "XHTML-Print is member of the family of XHTML languages defined by the Modularization of XHTML [XHTMLMOD]. It is designed to be appropriate for printing from mobile devices to low-cost printers that might not have a full-page buffer and that generally print from top-to-bottom and left-to-right with the paper in a portrait orientation. XHTML-Print is also targeted at printing in environments where it is not feasible or desirable to install a printer-specific driver and where some variability in the formatting of the output is acceptable." In essence, this subsets XHTML with the features appropriate for printing.

<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-CCPP-struct-vocab-20040115/">Composite Capability/Preference Profiles (CC/PP): Structure and Vocabularies 1.0</a>.
According to the abstract,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
This document describes CC/PP (Composite Capabilities/Preference Profiles) structure and vocabularies. A CC/PP profile is a description of device capabilities and user preferences. This is often referred to as a device's delivery context and can be used to guide the adaptation of content presented to that device.
</p>

<p>
The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is used to create profiles that describe user agent capabilities and preferences. The structure of a profile is discussed. Topics include:
</p>

    <ul>
	<li>structure of client capability and preference descriptions, AND</li>
	<li>use of RDF classes to distinguish different elements of a profile, so that a schema-aware RDF processor can handle CC/PP profiles embedded in other XML document types.</li>
</ul>


<p>
CC/PP vocabulary is identifiers (URIs) used to refer to specific capabilities 
</p>
and preferences, and covers:

<ul>
	<li>the types of values to which CC/PP attributes may refer,</li>
	<li>an appendix describing how to introduce new vocabularies,</li>
	<li>an appendix giving an example small client vocabulary covering print and display capabilities, and</li>
	<li>an appendix providing a survey of existing work from which new vocabularies may be derived.</li>

I've posted the notes from last night's <a href="slides/albany/xquery/">XQuery presentation</a> 
at the XML Developer's Network of the Capitol District, where a good time as had by all.  I have also posted 
the third alpha of <a href="xquisitor/">XQuisitor</a>, my GUI tool for querying XML documents based on XQuery and Saxon. Alpha 3 adds support for printing,
fixes some bugs, cleans up the user interface, is better integrated with Mac OS X and Windows, and externalizes most strings to support future localization. 
The build file can now create a single runnable JAR archive that doesn't require you to put Saxon in the bootclasspath, though for the moment I'm not distributing that because of license conflicts. 
</p>

<p>
XQuisitor has  been tested primarily on Linux and a little on Mac OS X 10.2. It should run on any Java 1.4 platform, but I haven't verified that. Java 1.4 and Saxon 7.8 are required. XQuisitor is published under the GPL.

<p> Malcolm Wallace and Colin Runciman have released
version 1.10 of <a
href="http://www.haskell.org/HaXml/">HaXml</a>, a bug fix release
of the  XML processing library for the  Haskell language.
According to the web page, </p>

<blockquote> <p> <b>HaXml</b> is a collection of utilities for
using <a href="http://www.haskell.org">Haskell</a> and <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml">XML</a> together.  Its basic
facilities include: </p>

<ul> <li> a parser for XML,</li>
<li> a separate error-correcting
parser for HTML,</li>
<li> an XML validator,</li>
<li>
pretty-printers for XML and HTML.</li> </ul>

<p> For processing XML documents, the following components are
provided: </p> <ul> <li><em>Combinators</em> is a combinator
library for generic XML document processing, including
transformation, editing, and generation.</li>
<li><em>Haskell2Xml</em> is a replacement class for Haskell's
Show/Read classes: it allows you to read and write ordinary
Haskell data as XML documents.  The <em>DrIFT</em> tool
(available from <a
href="http://repetae.net/~john/computer/haskell/DrIFT/">
<tt>http://repetae.net/~john/computer/haskell/DrIFT/</tt></a>)
can automatically derive this class for you.</li>
<li><em>DtdToHaskell</em> is a tool for translating any valid XML
DTD into equivalent Haskell types.</li>

<li>In conjunction with the <em>Xml2Haskell</em> class framework,
this allows you to generate, edit, and transform documents as
normal typed values in programs, and to read and write them as
human-readable XML documents.</li>
<li>Finally, <em>Xtract</em>
is a <em>grep</em>-like tool for XML documents, loosely based on
the XPath and XQL query languages.  It can be used either from
the command-line, or within your own code as part of the
library.</li> </ul> </blockquote>

	 for converting XML documents to PDF. Unlike most similar tools
	 it appears to be based on HTML and CSS rather than XSL
	 Formatting Objects. This is a bug fix release.

<p>
Jnnathan Borden and Tim Bray have  posted a new <a href="http://www.rddl.org/rddl2">draft version of RDDL 2.0</a>.
RDDL is the Resource Directory Description Language. It is an XML application based on XHTML Basic that is intended for documents placed aty the end of namespace URIs to allow humans and software to retrieve information about the XML application which uses that namespace. 
The new version
uses Tim Bray's non-XLink syntax which looks something like this:
</p>

<pre>&lt;a rddl:nature="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
		rddl:purpose="..."
		href="foo.html">Example&lt;/a></pre>	

<p>
To my mind this is a significant step backwards from the RDDL 1.0, XLink based  syntax. Requiring all related resources to be identified by <code>a</code> elements is very restrictive. I'm not sure why people think a new version of RDDL is needed, but if one is; this isn't the right one.

David Tolpin has released <a href="http://ftp.davidashen.net/incelim/">incelim</a>, 
 an open source XSLT stylesheet that splices RELAX NG schemas
 together. It  reads "a Relax NG grammar in XML syntax,
expands all includes and externalRefs, and optionally replaces references to
text, empty, or notAllowed with the patterns. The result is a 'compiled' schema
convenient for distribution, as well as for consumption by tools which do not
yet support include and externalRef." incelim is published under a BSD license.

One week from tonight,  on Wednesday, January 21, 2004, starting at 6:30 P.M.
I will be speaking to the  <a href="http://www.xdncd.org">XML Developers Network of the Capital District</a> in Albany, New York.
The topic is "XQuery: Exquisite or Excruciating?". 
I'll be exploring exploring XQuery 1.0, talking about 
 both the its syntax and semantics of this powerful new language. There'll 
 also be a personal demo of <a href="xquisitor/">XQuisitor</a>, a new open source GUI tool for querying XML based Michael Kay's Saxon 7.
The meeting takes place at the  <a href="http://www.hanys.org/about_hanys/Directions/directions.htm">HANYS offices in Renesselaer</a>. I'm told the  building will be locked; but
if you come to the front door (the side facing I-90), someone will let you in.

<p>
New results seem to have stopped coming in, so I think it's time to wrap up the results from the initial HTTP digest authentication tests. Bottom line: every significant browser except Netscape 4.x and <a href="http://lynx.isc.org/">Lynx</a> supports HTTP digest authentication as implemented by Apache 2.0. Specifically, Internet Explorer 5.0 and later (4.0 and later on the Mac) supports HTTP digest authentication, reports to the contrary notwithstanding, at least for simple cases. 
</p>

<p>
It is still possible that some more complex URLs using query strings, percent escapes, and/or fragment identifiers have interoperability issues. It is also possible that there are interoperability issues with POST if not GET. I need to cook up some tests for these possibilities. However, at a minimum, we have discovered that HTTP digest authentication is much more prevalent in the installed base than was previously thought. It should at least be offered as a preferred option to BASIC authentication for those browsers that do support it. 
In 2004, I can live with locking out Netscape 4.x users if I have to to get increased security, but
I'm not willing to turn off BASIC authentication until Lynx supports digest authentication. Adding digest authentication to Lynx should be a high priority item. Does anyone know the Lynx developers?

<sup>*</sup> This one needs confirmation. The correspondent has "an unconventional multi-version IE installation that makes exact version identification difficult and *may* (or may not) mean they're sharing some DLL's" 
I do now have one report of failure with IE 4.0 on Windows. 
</p>

<p>
I'd like to get more results, particularly Opera versions prior to 5.0,
Konqueror, Amaya, 
and Internet Explorer on Windows prior to 6.0. 
If you have these or any other browser not yet listed here,
could you please go to <a href="http://elharo.com/staging/">http://elharo.com/staging/</a> and attempt to login with the user name "invited" and the password "test". Whether you succeed or fail, please <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;elharo%40metalab%2Eunc%2Eedu?Subject=Authentication%20Results">e-mail me the results</a>, along with the version, vendor, and platform of your browser.
I don't really need any more results for Netscape 4.x and earlier. I'm pretty convinced those all fail (unless you find a version that works. That would be interesting.) Similarly I'm fairly sure Mozilla 1.0 and later all work. (Again, if you have evidence otherwise, please let me know.) Thanks.

I thought I'd catch up on a slew of DocBook news today. 
DocBook is an XML application designed for technical documentation 
and books such as <a href="books/xmljava/"><cite>Processing XML with Java</cite></a>. 
The first item of note is the posting of the second candidate release of <a href="http://docbook.org/xml/4.3CR2/index.html">DocBook 4.3</a>.  
</p>
<hr />
<p>
Norm Walsh has posted the <a href="http://docbook.org/xml/simple/1.1b1/index.html">first  beta of 
Simplified DocBook 1.1</a>, "a small subset of the DocBook XML DTD." 
This is based on full DocBook
4.3CR2 and adds support for HTML tables. All other markup should be the same as
in simplified DocBook 1.0.
</p>

<hr />
<p>
Walsh has also posted <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=21935&amp;package_id=21190&amp;release_id=205452">version 3.3.0 of DocBook Slides</a>, 
a system for replacing PowerPoint with XML. 
This release "contains a lot of patches and bug
fixes." It is based on Simplified DocBook 1.1b1.
</p>
<hr />
<p> <cite><a
href="http://docbook.org/tdg/en/">DocBook: The Definitive
Guide</a></cite> has been updated to version 2.0.9 to cover DocBook 4.3CR2.
According to Walsh, this is "a 'work in progress'. It purports to document DocBook V4.3 with the EBNF, HTML Forms, MathML, and SVG modules. As it is being actively updated, it may be inconsistent in some areas."
</p>
<hr />
<p>
Walsh has also released version 1.6.4.1 of his <a
href="http://docbook.sourceforge.net/projects/xsl/index.html">
XSLT stylesheets for DocBook</a>.  1.6.4 "includes many bugfixes (including an experimental fix for correctly generating links when the dbhtml 'dir' PI is used), some performance improvements, and some new features, including a new option for controlling which sections are included in running headers or footers, better control over superscript/subscript properties, and support for the newly add 'code' and 'stepalternatives' markup."
</p>
<hr />
<p>
Michael Smith has written a <a href="http://www.logopoeia.com/docbook/docbook-menu.html">DocBook Menu Mode for Emacs</a> that adds a hierarchical, customizable reference menu that
 provides "quick access to a variety of
DocBook-related documentation directly from within Emacs, and to files
in the DocBook XSLT stylesheets distribution."
Menu items include

	The W3C Voice Browser Working Group has posted the Candidate Recommendation 
	of the <a
	href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/CR-speech-synthesis-20031218/">Speech
	Synthesis Markup Language Version 1.0</a>. According to the
	abstract, the Speech Synthesis Markup Language "is designed to provide a rich, XML-based markup language for assisting the generation of synthetic speech in Web and other applications. The essential role of the markup language is to provide authors of synthesizable content a standard way to control aspects of speech such as pronunciation, volume, pitch, rate, etc. across different synthesis-capable platforms."
</p>

<hr />
<p>
The Voice Browser Working Group has also published the proposed recommendation of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/PR-speech-grammar-20031218/">Speech Recognition Grammar Specification Version 1.0</a>. "This document defines syntax for representing grammars for use in speech recognition so that developers can specify the words and patterns of words to be listened for by a speech recognizer. The syntax of the grammar format is presented in two forms, an Augmented BNF Form and an XML Form. The specification makes the two representations mappable to allow automatic transformations between the two forms."

Happy New Year. This is normally the point where I make a lot of promises about 
cool new features for this site that don't come to pass. However, for 2004 my plans are focused in on other areas. My goals for this year are three third editions, at least one peer-reviewed paper, and 1.0 releases of XOM and XQuisitor. 
</p>

<p>
The XML Apache Project has posted the third beta of <a href="http://xml.apache.org/xindice">XIndice
1.1</a>, an open source  native XML database
published  under the  Apache Software License.
Xindice

and the XML:DB XML database API  for Java as well as an XML-RPC interface.
Changes since 1.0 are mostly minor and include bug fixes and Java 1.4 support.
