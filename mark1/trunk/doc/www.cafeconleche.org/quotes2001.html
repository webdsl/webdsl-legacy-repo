Companies who maintain mission-critical company data tend to use a database to protect the integrity of their data. Few companies would like to keep important data in a system that could overwrite an invoice with a goose and not notice. That's why type safety matters - and especially if update, insert, and delete are allowed.	</blockquote><p>	--Jonathan Robie on the xml-dev mailing list	</p></dd><dt id="quote2001December30">Sunday, December 30, 2001</dt><dd>		<blockquote>	the historical fact is that XML 1.0 deliberately chose to force all information content of whatever kind into a textual representation based on the evidence that this pays off well in terms of interoperability.	</blockquote><p>	--Tim Bray on the  xml-dev mailing list	</p></dd><dt id="quote2001December29">Saturday, December 29, 2001</dt><dd>	<blockquote>	I think this was all part of a conspiracy for Chinese to catch upwith Japanese, since the Chinese code pages (until now) didn't havea mess the scale of SJIS.

At the other extreme, if a significant number of people convince themselves, or are convinced by their priests, that a martyr's death is equivalent to pressing the hyperspace button and zooming through a wormhole to another universe, it can make the world a very dangerous place. Especially if they also believe that that other universe is a paradisical escape from the tribulations of the real world.

It says that thebetter adapted an organism is to its current environment, the less change inits environment it can survive.  In the realm of data formats, this means thatthe effort spent optimizing a data format is likely to be wasted as soon asthe data to be conveyed changes, because the optimization took advantage ofwhat were effectively limitation on the data to be conveyed.    </blockquote><p>    --Eric Bohlman on the  xml-dev mailing list    </p></dd><dt>Monday, January 22, 2001</dt><dd>    <blockquote>My children at primary school are better trained on the Internet than the local                             police are</blockquote><p>--Tim Snape <br />Read the rest in <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,41288,00.html"> ISPs 'RIP' Into British Police</a></p></dd><dt>Saturday, January 20, 2001</dt><dd>    <blockquote>Consumers have a message for companies trying to figure out why thewireless Web market has failed to take off in this country: It's thescreen, stupid.</blockquote><p>--John Borland <br />Read the rest in <a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1004-201-4508408-0.html?tag=st.ne.1002.tgif.sf"> CNET.com - News - Communications - A high-wireless act</a></p></dd><dt>Friday, January 19, 2001</dt><dd>    <blockquote>Congress has effectively allowed Hollywood to write a statute that turns copyright                             holders' wishes into federal law with severe criminal penalties for anyone who does                             not comply with those wishes,                             Important individual rights                             like fair use, first sale, and the public domain are eliminated by the statute's sloppy                             handling of civil liberties.</blockquote><p>--Robin Gross <br />Read the rest in <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,41199,00.html"> Copyright: Your Right or Theirs?</a></p></dd><dt>Thursday, January 18, 2001</dt><dd><blockquote>Consumers have a message for companies trying to figure out why thewireless Web market has failed to take off in this country: It's thescreen, stupid.</blockquote><p>--John Borland <br />Read the rest in <a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1004-201-4508408-0.html?tag=st.ne.1002.tgif.sf"> CNET.com - News - Communications - A high-wireless act</a></p></dd><dt>Wednesday, January 17, 2001</dt><dd><blockquote><p>The World Wide Web has the potential to develop into a universal encyclopedia covering all areas of knowledge,      and a complete library of instructional courses.
