<p>The W3C  Web Services Activity has published new working drafts of
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-ws-policy-guidelines-20061221">Web Services Policy 1.5 - Guidelines for Policy Assertion Authors</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-ws-policy-primer-20061221">Web Services Policy 1.5 - Primer</a>.
According to the primer,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Web services are being successfully used for interoperable
solutions across various industries. One of the key reasons for
interest and investment in Web services is that they are
well-suited to enable service-oriented systems. XML-based
technologies such as SOAP, XML Schema and WSDL provide a
broadly-adopted foundation on which to build interoperable Web
services. The WS-Policy and WS-PolicyAttachment specifications
extend this foundation and offer mechanisms to represent the
capabilities and requirements of Web services as Policies.</p>
<p>Service metadata is an expression of the visible aspects of a
Web service, and consists of a mixture of machine- and
human-readable languages. Machine-readable languages enable
tooling. For example, tools that consume service metadata can
automatically generate client code to call the service. Service
metadata can describe different parts of a Web service and thus
enable different levels of tooling support.</p>
<p>First, service metadata can describe the format of the payloads
that a Web service sends and receives. Tools can use this metadata
to automatically generate and validate data sent to and from a Web
service. The XML Schema language is frequently used to describe the
message interchange format within the SOAP message construct, i.e.
to represent SOAP Body children and SOAP Header blocks.</p>
<p>Second, service metadata can describe the ‘how’ and ‘where’ a
Web service exchanges messages, i.e. how to represent the concrete
message format, what headers are used, the transmission protocol,
the message exchange pattern and the list of available endpoints.
The Web Services Description Language is currently the most common
language for describing the ‘how’ and ‘where’ a Web service
exchanges messages. WSDL has extensibility points that can be used
to expand on the metadata for a Web service.</p>
<p>Third, service metadata can describe the capabilities and
requirements of a Web service, i.e. representing whether and how a
message must be secured, whether and how a message must be
delivered reliably, whether a message must flow a transaction, etc.
Exposing this class of metadata about the capabilities and
requirements of a Web service enables tools to generate code
modules for engaging these behaviors. Tools can use this metadata
to check the compatibility of requesters and providers. Web
Services Policy can be used to represent the capabilities and
requirements of a Web service.</p>
<p>Web Services Policy is a machine-readable language for
representing the capabilities and requirements of a Web service.
These are called ‘policies’. Web Services Policy offers mechanisms
to represent consistent combinations of capabilities and
requirements, to determine the compatibility of policies, to name
and reference policies and to associate policies with Web service
metadata constructs such as service, endpoint and operation. Web
Services Policy is a simple language that has four elements -
<code>Policy, All</code>, <code>ExactlyOne</code> and

<code>PolicyReference</code> - and one attribute -
<code>wsp:Optional</code>.</p>

<p>
The W3C has published a proposed edited recommendation of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/PER-xmlbase-20061220/">XML Base (Second Edition)</a>. The most significant change is the addition of a section on
"Interpretation of same-document references":</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
RFC 3986 defines certain relative URI references, in particular the
empty string and those of the form <code>#fragment</code>,
as <em>same-document references</em>.  Dereferencing
of same-document references is handled specially.  However, their use as
the value of an <code>xml:base</code> attribute does not involve
dereferencing, and XML Base processors should resolve them in
the usual way.  In particular, <code>xml:base=""</code> does not
reset the base URI to that of the containing document.
  </p>

<p class="prefix"><b>Note:</b></p><p>
Some existing processors <em>do</em> treat these <code>xml:base</code>

values as resetting the base URI to that of the containing document,
so the use of such values is strongly discouraged.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I think that XOM is one of the processors that does treat 
<code>xml:base=""</code> as resetting the base URI. I'll have to look into that. 
The question that arises is whether there should be a way to reset the base URI to that of the containing document.

<a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/05/19/parsing.html">non-extractive</a> Java/C/C# library for  processing XML that supports XPath.
This appears to be an example of what Sam Wilmot calls "in situ parsing". In other words, rather than creating objects representing the content of an XML document, VTD-XML just passes pointers into the actual, real XML.
(These are the abstract pointers of your data structures textbook, not C-style addresses in memory. In this cases the pointers are int indexes into the file.) You don't
even need to hold the document in memory. It can remain on disk. 
This should improve speed and memory usage, but I haven't verified that.

I've posted beta 12
of <a href="http://jaxen.org/releases.html">Jaxen 1.1</a>, an open source 
(modified BSD license) XPath 1.0 engine for Java that is adaptable to many different object models including XOM, JDOM, DOM, and dom4j. 
Beta 12 is the first release candidate and has no known bugs. 
If no major problems are uncovered in the next couple of weeks, 1.1 will probably be released around the end of the year. 
Please try this release out, and let us know if you find anything problematic.
</p>

<p>
 The major changes in this release are the removal of the <code>Visitor</code> interface and the  matrix-concat extension function. 
We took them out because they were undocumented and buggy, and no one was willing to maintain them. If someone is willing to commit some resources (either temporal or financial) to them, they could be restored in the future. 
A few web site issues were fixed too.

 It includes C++,   Java, Perl, Python, TCL and PHP APIs. 
According to the announcement, 
"This release of Berkeley DB XML improves many aspects of query planning and execution.  Using indexed node storage, users will generally experience significant speed increase.  A new event-style layer allows for tight coupling between Berkeley DB XML and other XML processing code.  This greatly enhances integration with programming languages and XML parsing libraries by eliminating the need to create and then re-parse XML content.  The W3C XQuery 1.0 specification is nearing completion and this release of Berkeley DB XML is compliant with the current Proposed Recommendation."

"eXist is an Open Source native XML database featuring efficient, index-based XQuery processing, automatic indexing, extensions for full-text search, XUpdate support, XQuery update extensions and tight integration with existing XML development tools. The database implements the current XQuery 1.0 working drafts, with exception of the schema import and schema validation features defined as optional in the XQuery specification." The two version differ primarily in the indexing scheme used. 1.1 should be faster and not have document size limits. It's more bleeding edge, but 1.0 is quite a bit too limited for my tastes.

<p>
eXist is probably the major pure XML open source (LGPL) native XML database. 
However, whether it's ready for production use or not, and how large an application it can support, I don't know. 
I tend to doubt that it's the equal of DB 2 9 or Mark Logic, though I'd love to be proved wrong about that.

Microsoft's Craig Kitterman kicks off the morning by talking about "Ecma Office Open XML". That's a disingenuous name. This has nothing to do with OpenOffice. In fact, it's a direct competitor. Is there a trademark attorney in the house? 
</p>

<p>
This is the default format in Office 2007. .docx is the file extension. "100% compatible with previous office documents." In other words, 
everything in classic Office binary files can be converted to XML with full pixel level fidelity.
Licensed under Covenant Not to Sue and Open Specification Promise. The current draft spec is 6,000 pages long. 
</p>

<p>
The basic message of this talk is that the format is an open standard, supported by many players. I don't buy it. ECMA is the rubber stamp of standards organizations, and any company the size of Microsoft can get a few friends to lend their names.  6,000 page specs that document legacy formats aren't open. There's no reasonable way anyone can hope to implement all of this faithfully 
without Microsoft's legacy code base. I doubt even Microsoft can do it. 
Documenting all the kinks and corner cases of a 10+ year old legacy format of one product does not turn it into a true open standard. 
Open standards start from scratch with full consideration for all players. They are not crippled by insistence on 
compatibility with decades of legacy code from one product and one company.
 They are independent of particular implementations. This is not a neutral file format. It vastly privileges Microsoft Office. 
</p>

<p>
That said, I'm glad this exists. It is an improvement over Microsoft's classic, undocumented, binary file formats. However, it is not a plausible alternative to OpenDocument. It is far too complex and too baroque.

This was the most technical talk I've seen at this conference. I don't think I followed it all, but the ideas seem good. The notion of automatically 
rewriting location paths such that reverse axes turn into forward axes was quite clever. e.g. <code>/descendant::x[preceding-sibling::y]</code> becomes  
<code>/descendant::x[/descendant::y/following-sibling::node() == self::node()]</code>.

For the first morning session, Andrew Savikas from <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/">O'Reilly</a> talks about the Atom Publishing Protocol, <acronym>APP</acronym>; and there's no wireless again. They use DocBook subsets fro Safari and Safari U (but not the same subset). Moving from classic paper 
 book publishing to more continuous, adaptable publishing in a variety of formats 
is driving some changes in process. 
</p>

<p>
<acronym>APP</acronym> supports the creation of <strong>arbitrary</strong> resources over the Web, not just blog entries. They publish DocBook 4.4, XHTML, PDF, and a variety of image formats. "Having to resolve 10 years of DocBook validity errors takes a while." O'Reilly chose DocBook 4.4 because it's closest to their existing content, and the DocBook XSL stylesheets don't perfectly support DocBook 5 yet (though that's improving fast). The repository is a Mark Logic native XML database.

After the lunch break, I returned to Back Bay A for the <acronym>DITA</acronym> (Darwin Information Typing Architecture) panel, despite the nonexistent wireless network in this room.
I've heard a lot about DITA, but I'm not really sure what it does. My vague picture is sort of like DocBook but for man pages. Perhaps I'll get an idea whether or not this is worth paying further attention too. 
</p>

<p>
First speaker is Alan Houser from Group Wellesley. He''s giving the 30,000 foot view.
DITA was developed inside IBM to replace IBMIDDOC.
Donated to OASIS, DITA 1.0 is current spec. 1.1 is under development.
It's an architecture, not just a markup language.  
</p>


<ul>
	<li>Topics are core information units; a stand alone reusable chunk of information</li>

	<li>Task, concept, and reference information types</li>

	<li>Sppecialization and generalization: domain and structural specialization</li>


	<li>Attribute based formatting; like <code>class</code> attribute in HTML</li>

     <li>Maps organize topics, blocks, and words/phrases
         into books, web sites etc.</li>

<li>Metadata-based filtering excludes or annotates content at runtime.</li>
<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/dita-ot/">DITA Open toolkit</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Start by creating the map file (the outline) rather than the text.
</p>



<p>
Second speaker is Sean Angus from XyEnterprise talking about the <acronym title="Research in Motion">RIM</acronym> Blackberry and DITA. Cost of tranlsation reduced 75%. Productivity increased 20%. 14 month recouped investment.
</p>


<p>
Third speaker is Scott Hudson from Flatirons Solutions. He's talking about DocBook vs. DITA. This is interesting, but I'm falling asleep anyway. I may have to split early to hit Dunkin Donuts  for some coffee. Twice as much coffee as Starbucks for half the price.

Kenneth  Sall and Ronald R. Reck are talking about
"applying XQuery which is safe to say the hit technology of the conference" (Simon St. Laurent). Specifically they are talking about applying XQuery and <acronym title='Web Ontology Language'>OWL</acronym> to Wikipedia, the <acronym>CIA</acronym> World Factbook, and Project Gutenberg. They want to combine these data sources. 
</p>

<p>
Problem statement: find all the project Gutenberg books written by male European authors in the 19th century. 
</p>


<ol>
	<li>First they need to convert Project Gutenberg from text to RDF. </li>
	<li>Find the authors of each book in Wikipedia to determine gender and time. </li>
	<li>Use the factbook to identify European countries. </li>
</ol>

<p>
Wikipedia wasn't very structured or marked up. They had to use proximity search to determine nationality. 
</p>

<p>
Used the DAML OWL version of the CIA World Factbook.

eXist was their XQuery implementation. It worked well for them. Scalability is not yet known.

The final slot of the conference was the first one where I didn't find at least two sessions I really wanted to see. I decided to stick around in the Web 2.0 track to hear <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/hhalpin/">Harry Halpin</a> from the University of Edinburgh talk about
<a href="http://2006.xmlconference.org/programme/presentations/127.html">Social Semantic Mashups:  Exploring Social Networks with Microformats and GRDDL</a>.
</p>

<p>
Data is trapped within HTML or in relational databases behind firewalls. He wants to liberate the data and put it in a common format: RDF. Microformats are "the lower case semantic web". Many sites are using microformats including Yahoo; but data checks in. It doesn't check out. They are writing XSLT stylesheets to convert microformats documents to RDF. Social networks (Linked In, etc.) trap users within their own network. Oh my god! Eigenvectors! There's something I haven't seen or thought of for ten years, probably more. 
</p>

<p>
I think I get GRDDL for the first time. It's just a way of linking an arbitrary namespace well-formed XML document or an XHTML document
 to a stylesheet that transforms that document into RDF. That's it. 
You can also put the transformation links in the namespace document 
(e.g. RDDL) rather than in the document itself. 
</p>

<p>
I still don't buy the semantic web though (upper or lower case).

There are two kinds of conference keynotes. Some keynotes are given by 
techie celebrities talking about interesting things.
The second kind are given by some CEO or marketing flack you've never heard of, talking about their company's "vision". The crucial difference between the two is that the conference usually pays a large amount of money for the first and is paid a large amount of money for the second. It's the difference in whether the conference is selling the speakers to the attendees or the attendees to the speakers. 
Most conferences try to do a little of both to greater or lesser degrees. 
</p>

<p>
This one may actually be the first type.
The speaker is Darrin McBeath from Reed Elsevier
on Unleashing the Power of XML. Elsevier is not a conference sponsor, and is not selling us a product. They're an XML user, not a vendor. They use DTDs for documents, W3C schemas for some services. 
They've played with web services, but without a lot of success. They can only make this work with people they've been working with before, and whom they have contracts with; not with end users. (He seems a little surprised by this, but it's pretty much exactly what I'd expect from a SOAP-based system.) He claims web services haven't had a large impact on publishing. That doesn't surprise me either. 
</p>
<p>
Namespaces are a major weakness of XML, mostly due to complexity.
Schemas are too complex. 
In general, complexity of any kind and from any source seems like a
big problem for him. Only the techies understand XML. 
</p>

<p>
3 papers on XQuery last year at XML 2005. 9 papers this year.
I'm not sure that reflects anything real, or just the preferences of the referees.
Most publishers are not yet using either hybrid (XQuery+SQL) or native (XQuery only) XML databases. If anything they're using Saxon or DataDirect XQuery.
XQuery+XML database does speed up the development of publishing applications, and the execution speed of these applications.
Unlike other search engines, XQuery has no predefined granularity.

First conference session of the morning is Yahoo's Douglas Crockford 
 on "JSON, the Fat Free Alternative to XML". Of course, a fat free diet can kill you. 
I intend to listen very closely to this talk for
advocacy of  any nutritional deficiencies, fad diets, or eating disorders. 
I plan to explain why this approach is broken in my first panel session this afternoon. I expect I'll later write that up in a Cafes article. 
</p>


<p>
"XML on the Web has effectively died" -- Simon St. Laurent.</p>


<p> Douglas Crockford's question is "How should the data be delivered?" More accurately, in what format? He has programmer-colored glasses. He wants all his data to look like a programming languages data structure, specifically, JavaScript. I will explain exactly what is wrong with this goal this afternoon.</p>


<ul>
<li> <a href="http://json.org/">JSON</a> is language independent, text-based (Unicode; autodetected encoding), lightweight, easy-to-parse. </li>
	<li>Only for data, not documents. (a false dichotomy, IMNSHO)</li>
	<li>Based on quasi-literal notation.</li>
	<li> Types include integers, reals, strings, booleans, null. </li>
	<li>Objects are collections of name-value pairs. (Really it's just an associative array.) </li>
	<li>Names are strings that need not be unique (though it is recommended). </li>
	<li>Arrays are ordered lists. </li>
	<li>application/json MIME type. "It appears that compliance with formal standards causes things to break." </li>
	<li>No version. </li>
	<li>YAML is a superset of JSON.</li>
	<li>"JSON has become the X in AJAX"</li>
<li><code>eval</code> is a security risk; use <code>parseJSON</code> instead</li>
<li>There are other security issues I don't fully understand</li>
</ul>

<p>
"Because the consumer of your data and the generator of your data both tend to be written in programming languages, I contend it's not a problem."
</p>


<p>
He explains objections to JSON:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Namespaces</li>
	<li>No Validators</li>
	<li>Not extensible</li>
	<li>Not XML</li>
</ul>

<p>
I can't type fast enough to explain his arguments or rebut them, but he's missing <strong>a lot</strong>. He has a very narrow view of the world.
A little more on that this afternoon. 
</p>

<p>
There's a JSON-XML mapping, but someone screwed up. It's not fully round-trippable. 
I don't see any fundamental reason it couldn't be.  It just isn't. (XML->JSON is much trickier.)
</p>


<p>
JSON used to have comments, but people started putting metadata into comments, so they took them out. (Maybe people do need metadata?)

Next in this track, Jason Hunter discusses
Web Publishing 2.0 and XQuery. Content sizes are increasing.
People's expectations are growing for immediate, relevant, searchable access. 
XML doesn't fit well into a relational model. XML is a triangle (tree) and can't fit into rectangular tables (SQL). Excellent visualization.
I'll have to remember that one. 
</p>

<p>
He misses one of the crucial lessons of Google, though. Fielded search is powerful for professional librarians, but a failure for end users such as doctors (or really, anyone).
</p>

<p>
XML is the raw negative. It gives the publisher more information than Google (which only sees the HTML) so they can do better search. (True, but not important outside a few very special areas like Lexis-Nexis). Most searchers want broader search rather than more specialized. 
</p>

<p>
He sees a lot of Web 2.0 startups using mySQL that he thinks should be using a native XML database. Well, maybe; but until there's a decent open source native XML database that's not going to happen. Mark Logic is way too expensive for a startup.
<a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-mxd5/index.html">Last time I checked</a>, eXist was too unreliable. I do expect to see a solid open source native XML database, but probably not before 2008 at the earliest. 
</p>

<p>
They're some interesting use cases here such as Safari U, but it's all Web 1.0. So far I don't see any Ajax or interactivity with the client. It's all done on the back end with Mark Logic's XML database. He's proposing some personalization of RSS and so forth, but these examples are hypothetical. 
</p>

<p>
XQuery has much less impedance mismatch for web apps than relational databases and Java. Hibernate == translate Java to relational. JSF == translate Java to HTML.
XQuery has less translation to do.

I was in them. Simon St. Laurent led a rollicking panel on Web 2.0 and XML with

The final session was a panel on next generation XML APIs led by Norman Walsh. I talked about XOM.
Eric van der Vlist talked about TreeBind and Philippe 
Poulard talked about Active Tags. That session didn't go so well since none of us had enough time to really explain our approach, and everyone was rushed. Plus none of the panelists could see or comment on the others's slides.
</p>

<p>
Most of the panels at this show, including these two, were made by combining proposals  the referees didn't think were worth a full 45 minute slot; and that rarely works. In the future I think papers should be accepted or rejected without offering panel positions as consolation prizes. Panels are fun, but they need to be developed as a panel, not as an unrelated collection of 15 minute sessions.
</p>

<p>
One thought about panels: if there's PowerPoint or other forms of slides, they don't work. Panels are designed for conversation, not for lecture.

For the first session of the morning there were at least three interesting talks, and everyone I talked to thought they should go here Microsoft talk about the schema adoption study, but decided to go hear the fun one about Mozilla Application Development instead. (That's the sort of conference this is. Mozilla application development counts as fun. Even for these geeks, W3C schemas aren't fun.) 
</p>

<p>
It's a polite audience, too polite. If this were Extreme someone would have interrupted the first speaker by now. Ken Holman tells me it's been getting smaller every year. I thought this was supposed to be a the big XML conference but it really doesn't seem any bigger than Extreme, though they do run four concurrent tracks instead of two. 
</p>


<p>
Fabrice Desré from France Telecom is talking about developing applications on top of Mozilla with RDF and XUL. With JavaScript and DOM, it's too hard because of impedance mismatches between objects, XML, relational databases, and so forth. He wants to replace this with an XML centric architecture that stores all data in a native XML database (specifically Berkeley DB XML) and queries it with XQuery. He also introduces something called REX, remote events for XML.
 XForms are also involved somehow. 
</p>


<p>
REX is new to me. (I feel a developerWorks article coming on.) It's being developed by the W3C Web API working group. It's an XML grammar for representing DOM events, so it can transmit DOM modifications from one endpoint to another. It can stream and supports timestamped events. Supported events include:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>mutation</li>
	<li>node removed</li>
	<li>attribute modified</li>
	<li>character data modified</li>
</ul>


<p>
XPath-like syntax is used to target the events. XQuery generates the events. (How?)
</p>

<p>
What version of Mozilla supports this?
Possibly a customized version? 
XPCom components expose the database and the REX processor. 
</p>


<p>
They've defined two custom URI schemes, xdb to get a document out of the database and xqy to run an XQuery.
</p>

<p>
JavaScript is still needed because not all XUL widgets 
expose all their properties as XML.  Furthermore, XPCOM components are not accessible from XQuery. 
</p>


<p>
This has only been a high level overview. I'm left wanting to see some actual code, and an actual application.

The second session of the morning is also a tough choice, but I think I'm going to stick around in Back Bay B to hear Robin Hastings from the Missouri River 
Regional Library
talk about PHP and XML. I should probably listen to Michael Sperberg-Mcqueen discuss "Daddy? Where do schemas come from? Some facts of life for schema users" but the coffee ran out before I could get any; and I'm just not awake enough to pay attention to "rules for finding schema components", even though Michael's usually a wonderful speaker. The Microsoft talk on Linq and XLinq also sounds interesting, for the ideas at least. But it's likely to be limited to Microsoft platforms and thus unlikely to be directly  relevant to anything I do.   
</p>

<p>
She's talking about 
Magpie RSS, and RSS 1.0  reader written in PHP that  supports caching.
This might be a nice basis for a custom feed reader I could install on my server just for me. I find I prefer web-based aggregators like Artima or Bloglines from a user interface perspective. 
However, I don't like letting them know what I read. A custom local 
bloglines running on my desktop could be very useful.

Lunch was tastier than the usual cold sandwiches, but once again I got skunked on the coffee. This conference is suffering from a serious lack of caffeine. 
</p>


<p>
The afternoon commences with a talk from Sam Hiser about the OpenDocument 
plugin for Microsoft Office in Back Bay A. There is minimal wireless coverage in this room (unlike Back Bay B, which had no wireless access at all).
That is, occasionally the wireless cuts in for long enough for me to surf one web page or two, but it doesn't stay up long enough to check e-mail or do anything complicated.
I asked someone from the hotel staff about this, and he evinced shock that there was no wireless in the previous room, but I don't believe him. I know I'm not the only one who couldn't connect in that room -- and  I'm sure it's been a problem before. I wish hotels would stop lying about their Internet connectivity. They have to know they have problems. It's not like it's hard to set up wireless access. You just put a $50 router in every room.  I was told at lunch that the conference is switching hotels next year. Maybe the Marriott will be better.

Microsoft Office file formats all "check in through RTF". Word plugin in about 60% done. Another 3-4 months of work is required, but funding is needed first.
 The plugin will actually generate version 1.2 of ODF which isn't finished yet. There are too many incompatibilities between Word and ODF 1.0.

Next up is a panel discussion on using Word and/or OpenOffice to create XML documents.
Panelists include John Parsons from XyEnterprise and Marc Jacobson from Really Strategies and Clyde Hatter from Propylon.
According to Parsons, word processors are for one-off, single use, non-reuabale documents. XML is for reusable documents. Jacobson discusses customzing Word to generate XML in various ways. Hatter talks about OpenOffice, which seems to provide much superior hooks for extending it as a custom XML editor. What he's demoing is way beyond what Jacobson and Parsons showed with Word.

Third afternoon session is Patrick Chanezon with  Fun and Profit with the Google Checkout API, in Back Bay B. I'm sitting in the middle of the room instead of the back now; and, fingers crossed, this seems to have almost adequate wireless reception. 
I'm not sure what this talk is doing at an XML conference. Maybe it uses HTTP to transfer XML documents? We'll see. Yep, that seems to be what it's doing. Basic Auth over SSL. Synchronous and asynchronous. XML Digital Signatures.
 There's also an option to add a simple HTML form to your page (though it's unsigned).

63% of online shopping carts abandoned after beginning checkout. 37% of online purchases begin with search. Google checkout focuses on ease of use to encourage shopping. Transaction fees are cheaper for AdWords buyers.
Otherwise 2% + $0.20 er transaction. Google does not share customer e-mail address 
with the merchant. E-mail from merchant to customer must go through Google (which could read it). Not sure whether credit card statement indicates Google or merchant.
This is very important for disputes. 
</p> 

<p>
There's some back and forth from Google to the merchant to calculate shipping and taxes and so forth. Merchant must respond within 3 seconds or default values will be used. That's going to be tricky for small merchants. This is all non-trivial for a merchant to implement. It is much harder than accepting Paypal, for example. 
I am not sure this is all that much easier than accepting credit cards yourself.

The final afternoon session is Norm Walsh and Sam Page on XML Pipelines.
This should be interesting. I wrote about the rough approach of pipelines in Item 30 of <a href="books/effectivexml/">Effective XML</a>, but now there's a standard and some tools for doing this, instead of just having to roll your own. 
</p>

<p>
Three goals for the XML Processing Model (XProc):
</p>

<ol>
	<li>A vocabulary for  doucments that specify what should happen to a given set of XML documents in what sequence (call these processing schemas?)</li>
	<li>What are the default for processing in the absence of such a document?</li>
<li>Exception handling (very poorly described in current spec accoording to Norm)</li>
</ol>


<p>
Multistage XSLT and XInclude  are part of the problem. Validate before or after XInclusion or both?
</p>


<p>
Norm is implementing XProc in Java. 
</p>

<p>
Parameters can be passed to components; e.g.  XSLT variables.
Parameters are strings, not document fragments.
</p>

<p>
Dana Florescu asks about the data model. It's a good question. Not all the specs involved use the same data model.
They are punting on the data model, and I suspect that's the correct answer to Dana's question.
</p>


<p>
Dana Florescu also is worried about duplication with XQuery. Norm isn't. 
(me: XQuery duplicates a lot more of XSLT.)
</p>

<p>
I like what they're trying to do. The angle bracket syntax seems very hard to follow. The same names show up in too many different places, and mean too many different things. <code>step</code> and <code>source</code> are likely to change names.

The W3C Compound Document Formats Working Group has published an updated
last call working draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-CDR-20061122/">Compound Document by Reference Framework 1.0</a>.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Combining content delivery formats can often be desirable in
order to provide a seamless experience for the user.</p>
<p>For example, XHTML-formatted content can be augmented by SVG
objects, to create a more dynamic, interactive and self adjusting
presentation. A set of standard rules is required in order to
provide this capability across a range of user agents and
devices.</p>
<p>These are examples of possible Compound Document profiles:</p>
<ul>
<li>XHTML + SVG + MathML</li>
<li>XHTML + SMIL</li>

<li>XHTML + XForms</li>
<li>XHTML + VoiceML</li>
</ul>
<p>This document defines a generic <em>Compound Document by
Reference Framework</em> (CDRF) that defines a language-independent
processing model for combining arbitrary document formats.</p>
<p>NOTE: The Compound Document Framework is language-independent.
While it is clearly meant to serve as the basis for integrating
W3C's family of XML formats within its Interaction Domain (e.g.,
CSS, MathML, SMIL, SVG, VoiceXML, XForms, XHTML, XSL) with each
other, it can also be used to integrate non-W3C formats with W3C
formats or integrate non-W3C formats with other non-W3C
formats.</p>

The W3C the Timed Text (TT) Working Group
has posted the candidate recommendation of 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/CR-ttaf1-dfxp-20061116/">Timed Text (TT) Authoring Format 1.0 – Distribution Format Exchange Profile (DFXP)</a>. According to the abstract,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This document specifies the distribution format exchange profile (DFXP) of
the timed text authoring format (TT AF) in terms of a vocabulary and
semantics thereof.</p>

<p>The timed text authoring format is a content type that represents timed
text media for the purpose of interchange among authoring systems. Timed text
is textual information that is intrinsically or extrinsically associated with
timing information.</p>

<p>The Distribution Format Exchange Profile is intended to be used for the
purpose of transcoding or exchanging timed text information among legacy
distribution content formats presently in use for subtitling and captioning
functions.</p>

<p>In addition to being used for interchange among legacy distribution
content formats, DFXP content may be used directly as a distribution format,
for example, providing a standard content format to reference from a
<code>&lt;text&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;textstream&gt;</code> media object
element in a [SMIL 2.1] document.</p>

This appears to be an example of what Sam Wilmot calls "in situ parsing". In other words, rather than creating objects representing the content of an XML document, VTD-XML just passes pointers into the actual, real XML.
(These are the abstract pointers of your data structures textbook, not C-style addresses in memory. In this cases the pointers are int indexes into the file.) You don't
even need to hold the document in memory. It can remain on disk. 
This should improve speed and memory usage, but I haven't verified that.

The Apache XML Project has released <a href="http://xml.apache.org/commons/components/external/index.html">XML 
Commons External Components 1.3.04</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>xml-commons provides an Apache-hosted set of DOM, SAX, and JAXP interfaces for use in 
      other xml-based projects.  Our hope is that we can standardize on both a common version and 
      packaging scheme for these critical XML standards interfaces to make the lives of both 
      our developers and users easier.         
      </p>
<p>The External Components portion of xml-commons contains interfaces that 
      are defined by external standards organizations.  For DOM, that's the W3c; for SAX it's 
      David Megginson and sax.sourceforge.net; for JAXP it's Sun.  While we could send users to 
      each of the primary sources for these deliverables, keeping our own versions of these in 
      the xml-commons repository gives us a number of advantages:
      </p>
<ul>
        
<li>Simplicity of downloads: users get the whole product from one place.
        </li>
        
<li>Better version control: we can only take fixes we want, and add Apache-specific changes.
        </li>
        
<li>Better overview documentation of how these interfaces fit into the XML processing world.
        </li>
        

<li>More chance for cross-project community building within Apache projects.
        </li>
      
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p> This release
supports the Simple API for CSS (SAC) 1.3.
It also adds a 
 <code>SchemaFactoryLoader</code> class. 
"This class was removed from the JAXP 1.3 
specification before it was finalized but was mistakenly included in Java 
5. It only exists here (and in JAXP 1.4) for compatibility reasons. 
Applications should avoid using it." Various bugs are fixed as well.

<blockquote>
<p>
CSS 2.1 builds on CSS2 [CSS2] which builds on CSS1 [CSS1]. It supports media-specific style sheets so that authors may tailor the presentation of their documents to visual browsers, aural devices, printers, braille devices, handheld devices, etc. It also supports content positioning, table layout, features for internationalization and some properties related to user interface.
</p>

<p>
CSS 2.1 corrects a few errors in CSS2 (the most important being a new definition of the height/width of absolutely positioned elements, more influence for HTML's "style" attribute and a new calculation of the 'clip' property), and adds a few highly requested features which have already been widely implemented. But most of all CSS 2.1 represents a "snapshot" of CSS usage: it consists of all CSS features that are implemented interoperably at the date of publication of the Recommendation.
</p>

<p>
CSS 2.1 is derived from and is intended to replace CSS2. Some parts of CSS2 are unchanged in CSS 2.1, some parts have been altered, and some parts removed. The removed portions may be used in a future CSS3 specification. Future specs should refer to CSS 2.1 (unless they need features from CSS2 which have been dropped in CSS 2.1, and then they should only reference CSS2 for those features, or preferably reference such feature(s) in the respective CSS3 Module that includes those feature(s)).

The W3C XML Processing Model Working Group has posted the second public working draft of

</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An XML Pipeline specifies a sequence of operations to be

documents as their output. Steps in the pipeline <span class="rfc2119">may</span> read or write non-XML resources as well.</p>
<p>A pipeline consists of components. Like pipelines, components
take zero or more XML documents as their input and produce zero or
more XML documents as their output. The inputs to a component come
from the web, from the pipeline document, from the inputs to the
pipeline itself, or from the outputs of other components in the
pipeline. The outputs from a component are consumed by other
components, are outputs of the pipeline as a whole, or are
discarded.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of components: steps and (language)
constructs. Steps carry out single operations and have no
substructure as far as the pipeline is concerned, whereas
constructs can include components within themselves.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
Standard steps include load, parse, serialize, XSLT, and XInclude. Others may be defined.

SyncroSoft has released
 <a href="http://www.oxygenxml.com/onvdl.html">oNVDL</a>,  an open source <a href="http://www.jtc1sc34.org/repository/0694c.htm"><acronym title='Namespace-based Validation Dispatching Language'>NVDL</acronym></a> implementation based on James Clark's Jing. 
"NVDL stands for Namespace-based Validation Dispatching Language and it is Part 4 of ISO/IEC 19757 DSDL (Document Schema Definition Languages). It allows specifying sections of XML documents to be validated against different schemas thus enabling the creation of complex documents containing multiple languages without the need to modify the schemas that define each language to take into account the other languages. It allows also mixing different schema types like XML Schema, Relax NG and Schematron. A typical example is a document that contains XForms content inside XHTML."

The W3C Technical Architecture Group (TAG) has published
<a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/alternatives-discovery.html">On Linking Alternative Formats To Enable Discovery And Publishing</a>. The problem is:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
        Content creators wishing to publish multiple versions of a given
        resource on the Web face a number of questions with respect to
        how such URIs are created, published and discovered. Questions
        include:

        </p><ul><li><p>Given a resource
          <code>http://example.com/ubiquity/</code>
          that can be delivered in a multiplicity of representations,
          how should one publish the relevant URIs to enable automatic
          discovery of these representations (AKA <em>specific resources</em>)?</p></li>
<li><p>How does one ensure that the
          <em>alternative</em> relationship amongst these
          various representations is available in a  machine
          readable form, and
          consequently <em>discoverable</em>?</p></li>
<li><p>Here, multiple representations might include:
          </p><blockquote><p>Representations appropriate for different delivery
            contexts<br />Alternative formats of the resource
            distinguished by <code>Content-type</code><br />Different versions of the resource e.g., either by
language or date<br />Representations in different languages</p></blockquote>

          <p></p></li></ul>


      <p></p><p>This document explores the issues that arise in this context,
      and attempts to define best practices that help:
      
</p><ul><li><p>Preserve the <em>One Web</em>  while enabling   content
        publishing to  a multiplicity of delivery contexts.</p></li>
<li><p>Enable the creation of <em>RESTful</em> URIs that
        remain representation agnostic while delivering the correct
        end-user experience.</p></li>
<li><p>Enable automatic discovery of the available
        representations.</p></li>
<li><p>Enable web crawlers discover the relationship between a
  given generic resource and the specific resources that correspond to
  its various alternatives.
This will help search engines build better Web indices and avoid 
the need to index all available alternatives of a given resource</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The suggested solution is:</p>

<blockquote>
<ol type="1"><li><p>Create representation-specific URIs
            (specific resources) for each available
            alternative (<code>representation_i</code>), e.g.,
            <code>http://example.com/ubiquity/resource/representation_i</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>If no content negotiation is in place,
            serve  a canonical representation (generic resource) of the content at
            <code>http://example.com/ubiquity/resource</code></p></li>
<li><p>With that same URI,
            use HTTP content-negotiation, along with the correct
            HTTP VARY headers to serve up the  appropriate representation 
            at access time. Ensure that the VARY headers capture the right
            parameters that were used to choose the representation that is
            being served  —  this is important for correct behavior when
            using cacheing proxies.</p></li>
<li><p>
              As an alternative to the previous step,
              arrange for the server to generate an <code>HTTP
              302 (Found)</code>

              redirect to automatically serve up
              <code>http://example.com/ubiquity/representation_i</code>
              when <code>http://example.com/ubiquity</code> is accessed by
              <code>user-agent_i</code>.
              This form of redirect involves an extra client/server
round-trip,
and may therefore be suboptimal for mobile devices.
              This is a <em>temporary</em> redirect;
              the accessing user-agent should continue to use the canonical URI
              when creating bookmarks, or emailing URI.
Finally, note that to optimize link traversal out of the resulting
document, the content provider might wish to rewrite relative
links  to point at the specific resource.
              This will ensure that later uses of the URI results in
              expected end-user results; e.g., In the following scenario:
              </p><blockquote><p>Cell-phone user emails link<br />Recipiant opens message on a desktop<br />Clicks on the link</p></blockquote>

              The user following the link from inside the email message on a
              desktop browser should receive the desktop version, and not the
              mobile version. Notice that passing around the canonical URI is
              critical in achieving this behavior.
            <p></p><p>Additionally, contrast this solution with  using HTTP
            content-negotiation with VARY headers; using a redirect to the
            URI as a specific resource  has the advantage of freezing
            all parameters that were used to choose that representation into
            the URI.</p></li>
<li><p> Use linking mechanisms provided by the
            representation being served to create
            <em>links</em> to the other available
            representations. As an example, when using HTML, one
            might use <code>a</code> and <code>link</code>
            elements to advertize the availability of alternate
            representations. In this context, note that there are
            two distinct types of such links:
            </p>

<blockquote><p>Links for human consumption that are to be
              presented to the user<br />And links for machine consumption, that are
              used by the user agent to provide additional functionality.</p></blockquote>

<p>
            As an example, links to available alternatives meant
            for human consumption might use the HTML
            <code>a</code> element since these are rendered by
            user-agents. In contrast, links meant for use by bots
            might use the HTML <code>link</code> element  — 
            as an example, this reflects present practice when
            publishing pointers to 
            Atom/RSS feeds.</p>

<p>In either case, notice that  following these steps
          creates a 
          mini-graph comprising of the canonical URI and  URIs
          for its various representations. </p></li></ol>
</blockquote>

<p>
This is actually just the solution suggested for one 
particular use case, but the others are very
similar. 
</p>

<p>
This seems wise, and in general points out something I've
noticed in designing RESTful systems. The server maintainer
needs to be able to freely define resources and invent URLs
pointing to those resources. A given resource can have more than
one URL, and indeed different parts of one document may be
individual resources with their own unique URLs. For example,
this page could have one URL (http://www.cafeconleche.org/) and
every news item on the page could have its own URL
(http://www.cafeconleche.org/news/November_14_2006_35156,
http://www.cafeconleche.org/news/November_14_2006_34857). Parts
of the page could be updated by PUTting the relevant content to
the individual item URLs. </p>

<p> Of course this requires an additional layer of indirection
on the server, maybe more than one. The current static file
system that serves Cafe con Leche can't really handle this.
However fewer and fewer sites are generated out of static files
these days anyway. The key is to design the server side systems
such that URLs are freely created for everything of interest.
</p>

<p> I'm reminded of a problem a lot of my intro to Java students
have. They can't figure out how to make two objects talk to each
other (often action listeners and the applet they're responding
to) so they want to put everything in one class. The proper
solution to this problem is to add methods to one or the other
of the two classes so the objects can communicate. In the
RESTful world of HTTP, when you find you're having trouble
sending the server the message you want to send it, the solution
is definitely not adding a new method. Rather it's adding a new
URI. Don't be afraid of URIs. A good RESTful system will have
lots of them.

IBM has published the second maintenance release of <a href="http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/mrel2/jsr110/index.html"> Java Specification Request 110,
Java APIs for WSDL</a>.  This is actually a fairly major, functional update compared to most maintenance releases. Changes include
</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li> Read WSDL from a DOM Element specifying the base URI via a WSDLLocator instead of a 
URI string. See new method <code>WSDLReader.readWSDL(WSDLLocator, Element) </code>
</li>
<li> Perform ‘clean up’ of a WSDLLocator object to release system resources and/or prepare it for 
reuse (e.g. close any open input streams). See new method WSDLLocator.close().  
</li>

<li> Specify the WSDLFactory implementation class name via a property file located in /META-INF/services. This permits more fine-grained control than the existing system-wide means of 
specifying the class name, namely; as a JVM system property, via a property file in the 
JRE/lib directory or via an implementation-specific default. See Javadoc for the 
<code>WSDLFactory.newInstance()</code> method. 
</li>

<li> Specify not only the WSDLFactory implementation class, but also the classloader used to 
load it. See new method WSDLFactory.newInstance(String, ClassLoader). 
</li>

<li> ‘Flatten’ a WSDL import tree by returning all PortTypes, Bindings or Services declared in the 
top-level Definition and in any imported Definitions. See the new methods on the 
javax.wsdl.Definition interface <code>getAllPortTypes()</code>, <code>getAllBindings()</code> and 
<code>getAllServices()</code>. 
</li>

<li> Explicitly get operations with unnamed input or output messages by specifying the value 
“:none” for those search parameters (versus the existing API behaviour of specifying null to 
ignore input or output message name from the search criteria). See the new Javadoc for 
methods <code>PortType.getOperation(String,String,String)</code> and 
<code>Binding.getBindingOperation(String,String,String)</code>. 
</li>

<li> For every addXXX method in the JWSDL API ensure a corresponding removeXXX method 
exists. This will improve the programmatic modification of WSDL definitions. 
</li>

<li> Relax the restrictions on the use of extensibility elements and attributes imposed by the W3C 
WSDL </li>

<li>1 schema (and enforced by JWSDL </li>
<li>1) and instead permit every WSDL element to 
be extensible by elements or attributes, as per the WS-I Basic Profile </li>
<li>1 requirements. This 
will enable JWSDL to support the new JAX-WS specification. 
</li>

<li> SOAP 2.1 binding extensions. See the new package <code>javax.wsdl.extensions.soap</code></li>
<li> <code>WSDLException.toString()</code> changed so that it no longer prints the stack trace, but 
instead just returns the ‘short message’, as described for the <code>Exception.toString()</code> 
method in Java 1.4 
</li>

<li> The minimum supported Java level is now Java 1.4. It was previously Java 1.2</li>

to the Java Community Process (<acronym title="Java Community Process">JCP</acronym>). 
This attempts to subset SAX, StAX, JAXP, <strong>and</strong> DOM to run in small devices. This strikes me as such as bad idea, it's hard to believe they're serious.
If size is such a concern (and in small devices it is) then pick one API and stick with it; or design a new one. Don't try to pull out half of each. Including both SAX and StAX in particular really smells of design by committee. There's no need to force both on device vendors. Pick one and be done with it.

<acronym title="Java Specification Request">JSR</acronym> 222:  Java Architecture for XML Binding 2</a>. Changes appear quite large, beyond what I'd expect from a real maintenance draft. For example,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Today, it just takes too many lines to do a simple stuff with JAXB. One typical
example is the following code for reading XML from a file:
</p>

<pre>  File in = new File("FamilyData.xml");
  JAXBContext jc = JAXBContext.newInstance("kgh.geneology.xml");
  Unmarshaller u = jc.createUnmarshaller();
  JAXBElement junk = (JAXBElement)u.unmarshal(fin);
  DataFile df = (DataFile) junk.getValue();
</pre>

<p>
(and if you count exception handling, add at least 4 lines for that.) Think of
the DataFile class as the top-level class generated by a schema compiler.
</p>

<p>
We need convenience methods that focus on typical simple use case.
</p>


<h3>
Proposed Solution
</h3>

<p>
Define the JAXB class and the unmarshal/marshal methods on them.
Those methods generally look like this:
</p>

<pre>
    public static &lt;T> T unmarshal( SOMETHING xml, Class&lt;T> type );
    public static void marshal( Object jaxbObject, SOMETHING xml );
</pre>

<p>
These methods do not throw checked exceptions.

Though XStream is mostly intended as a back-end for higher-level
languages, it is also possible to use it directly. The language
features ML-like pattern matching and higher-order functions, but no types."

<ul>
	<li>A new namespace URI, <code>http://www.w3.org/2004/xforms/</code></li>
	<li><code>power</code>, <code>luhn</code>, <code>current</code>, <code>choose</code>, <code>id</code> and <code>property</code> XPath extension functions</li>

</p>

<ul>

	<li>The <code>days-to-date(number)</code> and <code>seconds-to-dateTime(number)</code> function returns a string containing an xsd:date for the date that occured that many days/seconds since midnight January 1, 1970.</li>

	<li>The <code>local-date()</code>  function returns an <code>xsd:date</code> for the current time in the current time zone. </li>

	<li> <code>encode()</code> and <code>decode()</code> functions for converting strings to and from hex or base-64.</li>

	<li> digest() and <code>hamc()</code> functions for calculating hash functions.</li>

	<li>A random() generates a uniformly distributed random or pseudorandom number between 0.0 and 1.0.</li>

	<li>XPath expressions can be used to specify values.</li>

	<li>The submission element allows an optional <code>serialize</code> attribute. If the value of this attribute is false, then  instance data is not serialized or submitted.</li>

	<li>The <code>replace</code> attribute of submission supports the additional value of text. If this setting is made, and the submission response conforms to an XML mediatype (as defined by the content type specifiers in [RFC 3023]) or a text media type (as defined by a content type specifier of text/*), then the response data is encoded as text and replaces the content of the replacement target node.</li>

	<li>HTTP headers can be controlled from the XForm submission.</li>

	<li>Support help and hint in item and choices has been removed. </li>
</ul>

Instead of processing data as it is passed from the parser to callbacks, a script using XML_PullParser requests "tokens" from various "tokenizing" functions. Tokens are arrays representing XML structures, which become available in the order in which they appear in the document being parsed.

In addtion to the tokenizers, a rich set of accessors are provided to extract data from the elements and attributes bundled in the tokens. There are also techniques and class methods for selecting elements and attributes, and for testing for their position and relevancy. Finally, there are package-level functions to set the contexts that affect the operations of the module."

<p>The markup includes a namespace-qualified attribute for use
in general-purpose XML documents and a profile-qualified
link relationship for use in valid XHTML documents. The GRDDL
mechanism also allows an XML namespace document
(or XHTML profile document) to declare that every document associated
with that namespace (or profile) includes gleanable data and for
linking to an algorithm for gleaning the data.</p>

<p> The W3C Multimodal Interaction Working Group has published
	the last call working draft of the <a
	href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-InkML-20061023/">Ink Markup
	Language</a>. According to the abstract, </p>

	<blockquote> The Ink Markup Language serves as the data format for representing ink entered with an electronic pen or stylus. The markup allows for the input and processing of handwriting, gestures, sketches, music and other notational languages in applications. It provides a common format for the exchange of ink data between components such as handwriting and gesture recognizers, signature verifiers, and other ink-aware modules.

...
<p>This fourth version of the Working Draft includes a few
conceptual changes to simplify the definition while achieving
greater expressive power. It also contains many small changes of
details to make element and attribute use uniform accross the the
definition to make it easier to learn and simpler to process.</p>

<p>The main changes are:</p>

<ul>
<li>InkML now more robustly supports program transformations. The
text has been revised to remove any requirement for a particular
element order in archival ink. This allows applications to regroup
and organize traces into logical structures without losing
information.</li>

<li>InkML now more robustly supports streaming. The content model
of the top-level ink element has been relaxed to allow
interspersion of more definitional elements. The definition of
continuation traces has been simplified.</li>

<li>InkML now better supports optical devices and other
technologies. The language has been revised to be technology
neutral, where possible, and to keep technology-specific concepts
localized to specific elements.</li>

<li>There is greater support for applications to use InkML as a
representation for their own application-defined structures. Trace
groups and trace references can be nested, allowing applications to
group ink into logical units, if desired. This may be done to the
explicit ink traces or by reference.</li>

<li>The support for annotation has been enhanced to allow arbitrary
textual or XML-based annotation. This provides sufficient hooks for
rich semantic annotation of ink while keeping the standard simple.
The model is based on experience with MathML.</li>

<li>The concepts of trace formats and capture devices have been
more clearly distinguished. Trace formats can be used to describe
all the logical properties of an ideal channel. They are used to
describe traces and the coordinates of shared canvases.
Consequently, the channel element has a richer set of attributes.
Capture devices are now seen as "ink sources" which may
additionally describe other characteristics of the ink source, such
as accuracy, latency, channel cross-coupling, etc.</li>

<li>The notions of canvas transformations and channel mappings have
been converged into a single mapping type. As a consequence,
applications may agree on more general coordinate systems for
shared canvases. (For example, they may share tip force
information.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Several changes of detail have been made to support the above,
to make the naming and use of elements and attributes consistent,
and to remove duplication.</p>

 </blockquote>

<p>
My main objection to this spec is that 
it embeds lots of non-XML markup that you have to write your own parser for, rather than using an XML parser.</p>

<pre class="ex" xml:space="preserve">&lt;trace id = "id4525abc">
   1125 18432,'23'43,"7"-8,3-5,7 -3,6 2,6 8,3 6 T,2 4*T,3 6,3-6 F F

The W3C Device Independence Working Group has posted a second  last call  working draft of  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-cselection-20061010/">Content Selection for Device Independence (DISelect) 1.0</a>.
They've also split out the XPath parts into a separate document,
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-cselection-xaf-20061010/">Delivery Context: XPath Access Functions</a>.
Finally they've started work on a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-cselection-primer-20061010/">primer</a> about all this, though it's mostly empty at this point.
</p>


<p>
 According to the abstract, "This document specifies a syntax and processing model for general purpose content selection or filtering. Selection involves conditional processing of various parts of an XML information set according to the results of the evaluation of expressions. Using this mechanism some parts of the information set can be selected for further processing and others can be suppressed. The specification of the parts of the infoset affected and the expressions that govern processing is by means of XML-friendly syntax. This includes elements, attributes and XPath expressions."
</p>


<p> 
That sounds unobjectionable, but what the working group is 
really proposing  is XML markup that can be added to a page to indicate which devices certain content is appropriate for. For example, this <code>sel:if</code> element says that the image should only be displayed if the user's device supports color or has a window size wider than 500 pixels. 
</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div sel:expr="dc:cssmq-width('px') &amp;gt; 500" 
    &amp; dc:cssmq-color() &gt; 0" >
  &lt;object src="picture.png"/&gt;
&lt;/div></code></pre>

<p>
This feels more than a little like presentation based markup. 
This is very much like using JavaScript or server side programs to identify different browsers and send them content tailored specifically to them.  This syntax  is definitely easier-to-use, and more powerful  than the various JavaScript and server-side hacks people use today; but should we be doing this at all? 
Whatever happened to the vision of sending browsers XML documents with appropriate stylesheets and letting the client decide how to best present it? The thing that bothers me the most about this proposal is that the syntax mixes the presentation information straight into the document, rather than linking to it from a separate hints sheet. In many ways, this document seems to reflect a belief that the W3C has been going down the wrong road for the last eight years in attempting to separate content from presentation.

The Apache Web Services Project has posted version 0.5.2 of <a href="http://ws.apache.org/jaxme/">JaxMe 2</a>,
an open source implementation of the Java API for XML Binding.
Quoting from the web page,
</p>


<blockquote>
<p>
        JaxMe 2 is an open source implementation of
        <a href="http://java.sun.com/xml/jaxb/"><span class="codefrag">JAXB</span></a>, the specification for
        Java/XML binding. 
      </p>

      <p>A Java/XML binding compiler takes as input a schema
        description (in most cases an XML schema but it may be a DTD, a
        RelaxNG schema, a Java class inspected via reflection or a database
        schema). The output is a set of Java classes:
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A Java bean class compatible with the schema description. (If the schema was
            obtained via Java reflection, then the original Java bean class.)</li>
          <li>An unmarshaller that converts a conforming XML document into the equivalent Java bean.</li>
          <li>Vice versa, a marshaller that converts the Java bean back into the original XML document.</li>
        </ul>
      <p>

        In the case of JaxMe, the generated classes may also
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Store the Java bean into a database. Preferably an XML database like
            <a href="http://exist.sf.net/"><span class="codefrag">eXist</span></a>,
            <a href="http://xml.apache.org/xindice/"><span class="codefrag">Xindice</span></a>, or
            <a href="http://www.softwareag.com/tamino/"><span class="codefrag">Tamino</span></a>, but it may also
            be a relational database like <a href="http://www.mysql.com/"><span class="codefrag">MySQL</span></a>.
            (If the schema is sufficiently simple. :-)</li>
          <li>Query the database for bean instances.</li>

          <li>Implement an EJB entity or session bean with the same abilities.</li>
        </ul>

Something very weird is going on in the XHTML 2/XForms space, and either I'm totally misunderstanding what they're up to, or they've gone completely off the rails. I'm not the only one who thinks this either. I've been hearing from working group members who are perhaps not quite as befuddled about this as I am, but who seem equally perturbed by the developments. I really want to figure out why the XHTML working group is doing what they're doing (and why the XForms working group is going along with them). It's hard to credit that the reason could possibly be as trivial as it seems to be, but so far no one has suggested anything else.  Possibly I should bring this issue to the TAG for discussion, but I want to make sure I understand it first.

Infoblazer LLC has released 
the <a href="http://www.xxframework.org/">XX Framework 1.1</a>,  a configurable, open source (LGPL), XML/XSL-centric implementation of the Model-View-Controller development paradigm. According to the announcement:
</p>


<blockquote>
<p>
The primary goal of the XX Framework is to handle typical application CRUD (create, retrieve, update, delete) with little or no Java programming. Instead of telling the application how to retrieve and how to display the data, we configure what to retrieve (through XML) and what to display (through XSLT). 
</p>

<p>
This approach generally leads to a simpler and more elegant solution that a purely procedural approach. Where the applications needs more than simple CRUD, additional business logic can be easily incorporated into the process. Some additional features of the framework are configurable data caching, thread pooling, and web service integration.
</p>

<p>
Some benefits of the framework are:
</p>
 
<ul>
	<li>Extremely simple to use</li>
	<li>Built around open web standards, including <acronym>J2EE</acronym>, <acronym>XHTML</acronym>, <acronym>XML</acronym>, <acronym>XSL</acronym>, <acronym>CSS</acronym></li>
	<li>Uses XSL and CSS as the application's View layer, allowing total separation of presentation from back end concerns. Page-focused/HTML templating approaches rarely achieve this separation</li>
	<li>Configurable data caching for optimal performance</li>
	<li>Automated data persistence (CRUD). 80% of a typical web app can be built with no Java code</li>
	<li>Uses a Portal-based approach to page design, allowing easy compartmentalization of functionality</li>
	<li>Integration with web services</li>
	<li>Reuse common classes and operations for pre-built functionality</li>
	<li>Enabled caching and thread pooling for greatly increased performance</li>
</ul>

<p>
The framework promotes a use case oriented development approach. In this approach, use cases are defined for each task the user will perform. In general, each use case will be implemented by a single logical servlet, as defined in the J2EE Specification. The logical servlet may be implemented by one or more implementation classes each implemented a distinct portion of that use case and providing a portion of the resultant display.
</p>

<p>
The developer simply needs to write implementation of for these classes. Configuration files determine which implementation classes are called based on user click events. The most common implementation approach has each class return an XML result, yielding a set of XML documents for each use case.. XSL transformation is then applied to the XML results, each transform providing a portion of the desired display. A single JSP page is then used to display the final product.
</p>

<p>
The framework then builds upon this foundational approach to provide automation of typical application tasks, such as add, update, delete, select of records from a database. By specifying a simple mapping from the HTML page on one end, through the middle layers, and to the database on the other end, a large subset of application functionality can be achieved without the need to write any Java code. Instead, a combination of XML configuration files, XSL transformation templates, as well as open source tools, namely Hibernate and Castor, are used.
</p>

<p>
The goal of the framework is to incorporate more and more common programming tasks, in an open, configurable, and generic manner. Furthermore, since much of the framework if based on XML and XSL, automatic generation of complete applications is achievable.
</p>

          <li>Inline spell checking in forms (ironically the first word it flagged for me as misspelled was "Firefox")</li>
          <li>Search plugin manager</li>
<li><a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Microsummaries">Microsummaries</a> feature for bookmarks</li>
          <li>Automatic restoration of your browsing session if there is a crash</li>

<p>
I've been using Firefox 2 as my primary browser since beta 1, and it's been pretty smooth over all.
The inline spell checking is indispensable, and worth the upgrade alone. 
The restore session option is also quite nice. 
As of the last release candidate all my important extensions now seem to work in this version.

Google has launched <a href="http://google.com/coop/">Google Coop</a>, a customized search engine service for sites like this one. 
I've been using Google searches here for a while. The search box on the right is just a simple form that links to regular Google. However, now they're letting me customize it more, give preference to links to this site without excluding other sites, change the look and feel of the search results (or even host my own), and get kickbacks^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H referral fees for the ads on the search results page.
I'm still playing with this. I haven't yet figured out how to set the look and feel to fit into the sidebar, but in the meantime here's a basic search box. Try it out and see what you think:
</p>

<!-- Google CSE Search Box Begins -->
<form id="searchbox_003415462648440894435:9ubqn7jh_ni" action="http://google.com/cse">
  <input type="hidden" name="cx" value="003415462648440894435:9ubqn7jh_ni" />
  <input name="q" type="text" size="40" />
  <input type="submit" name="sa" value="Search" />
  <input type="hidden" name="cof" value="FORID:1" />
</form>
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://google.com/coop/cse/brand?form=searchbox_003415462648440894435%3A9ubqn7jh_ni"></script>
<!-- Google CSE Search Box Ends -->

<p>
OK. I've figured out how to hack the search box code
so that it fits nicely in the sidebar.
The next question is just whether that violates the Google Coop terms of service or not. They tend to be picky about things like that.  Looks like that might be OK. I don't see anything in the terms of service that suggests they mind this. 
</p>


<p>
I may also have to configure this so it only searches the sites I specify. I don't mind it giving out additional sites that may be helpful, but it doesn't always place hits from my sites on the first page; and if someone uses the search box on my page that's probably what I want. For instance, I searched for "Downs", an unusual string that occurs about twice on all the sites (both in the last week or two) and it didn't find either of those hits. Instead, it found irrelevant sites about Downs syndrome, and companies named Downs.

Microsoft has released <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.mspx">Internet Explorer 7</a> (Windows XP only). <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/10/18/internet-explorer-7-for-windows-xp-available-now.aspx">According to general manager Dean Hachamovitch</a>:</p>

Five years ago this release might have been state-of-the-art. Today, it's a browser that still doesn't fully support <acronym>CSS</acronym>, still doesn't recognize the right MIME types for  <acronym>XHTML</acronym> and <acronym>XSLT</acronym>, still doesn't pass the Acid 2 test, still doesn't support <acronym title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</acronym>, MathML, or XForms, and can only be considered an improvement by comparison to previous versions of itself. There's nothing here that will impress Firefox or Safari users.

It's not immediately clear what's changed since RC 2, but presumably bugs were fixed. I've been using Firefox 2 as my primary browser since beta 1, and it's been pretty smooth over all.
The inline spell checking is indispensable, and worth the upgrade alone. 
The restore session option is also quite nice. 
The only problem I've encountered are extensions that don't yet support FireFox 2.

XimpleWare has released  
<a href="http://vtd-xml.sf.net">VTD-XML 1.7</a>, a free (GPL) 
<a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/05/19/parsing.html">non-extractive</a> Java library for  processing XML that supports XPath.
This appears to be an example of what Sam Wilmot calls "in situ parsing". In other words, rather than creating objects representing the content of an XML document, VTD-XML just passes pointers into the actual, real XML.
(These are the abstract pointers of your data structures textbook, not C-style addresses in memory. In this cases the pointers are int indexes into the file.) You don't
even need to hold the document in memory. It can remain on disk. 
This should improve speed and memory usage.
Current tree models typically require at least 3 times the size of the actual document, more often more. Using a model based on indexes into one big array might allow these to reduce their requirements to twice the size of the original document or even less. VTD-XML claims 1.3 times, but I haven't verified that.
</p>

<p>
However VTD-XML currently 
only supports the built-in entity references (&amp;quot; &amp;amp; &amp;apos; &amp;gt; &amp;lt;). They're some other limits. Element names are limited to 2048 characters. Documents can't be much bigger than a billion characters, so SAX (or XOM) is still needed for really huge documents. There's also a maximum depth to the document, though exactly what it is isn't specified. 
All this means VTD-XML is  not a conformant  XML parser. Given this,  comparisons to other parsers are unfair and misleading. I've seen many products that outperform real XML parsers by sub-setting XML and cutting out the hard parts. It's often the last 10% that kills the performance. :-(
The other question I have for anything claiming these speed gains is whether it correctly implements well-formedness testing, including the internal DTD subset. Will VTD-XML correctly report all malformed documents as malformed? Has it been tested against the W3C XML conformance test suite? I'm not sure.

The Gnu Project has released <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gnuzilla/">IceWeasel</a>, a Linux browser based on Firefox that is more free than Firefox. There's also Gnuzilla, a Gnu version of the whole Mozilla suite. The differences freedom wise between Gnuzilla/IceWeasel on the one hand and Mozilla/Firefox on the other are pretty trivial, and have been widely <a href="http://brianmckenna.org/blog/linux/5-reasons-to-support-iceweasel/">discussed</a> <a href="http://engtech.wordpress.com/2006/10/12/iceweasel-why-proprietary-software-will-always-win-out">elsewhere</a>. They remind me of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chosen_Realm_%28Enterprise_episode%29">Star Trek Enterprise episode</a> where a planet gets destroyed over the question of whether
God created the universe in nine days or ten. What hasn't been mentioned is that IceWeasel is making some security improvements I've been hoping Firefox would make for years. Specifically,<br clear="all"/>
</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
 Some sites refer to zero-size images on other hosts to keep track of
 cookies. When IceWeasel detects this mechanism it blocks cookies from
 the site hosting the zero-length image file. (It is possible to
 re-enable such a site by removing it from the blocked hosts list.)
</li>
<li>
 Other sites rewrite the host name in links redirecting the user to
 another site, mainly to "spy" on clicks. When this behavior is
 detected, IceWeasel shows a message alerting the user.
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>


<img src="images/GStubbs7-iceweasel.png" alt="" width="177" height="150" hspace="5" vspace="5" border="0" align="right" />
<p>
Freedom issues aside, that's reason enough alone to switch to IceWeasel.
</p>

<p>
One final note: while I do appreciate humor in the jab at Mozilla implies by the name Ice<em>Weasel</em>, I suspect it will just turn off regular users. Why not call this something a little less negative like IceMink or IceFerret? The proposed logos are great though, and could do for Firefox what Tux did for Linux.

Next week, my university, Polytechnic in Brooklyn, is 
hosting 
<a href="http://idmi.poly.edu/drupal/">Hyperpolis 3.0: Really Useful Media</a>, a free conference dedicated to digital media:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
We don't know enough about digital media as something other than a means to an end, as “instrumental culture”, where culture itself —mainstream, alternative, underground, or otherwise— is degraded to the status of tools (some hard, some soft, all ware).
</p>

<p>
We know too much about media discourses as, on the one hand, “popular culture”: alienated and commodified cultural forms; and on the other, “cultural theory”: paranoid cosmologies of hyper-rhetoric, and the ubiquitous inevitability of evil...
</p>

<p>
Hyperpolis: Really Useful Media will provide a forum for the discussion and presentation of some positive contributions to the field, in light of these chronic imbalances.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
The conference takes place 
Thursday, October 19th and Friday, October 20th from  11am to 6pm in the
Dibner Auditorium at Polytechnic University, 6 MetroTech in Brooklyn.

I'm uploading  beta 11
of <a href="http://jaxen.org/releases.html">Jaxen 1.1</a> as I type this.
Jaxen is an open source 
(modified BSD license) XPath 1.0 engine for Java that is adaptable to many different object models including XOM, JDOM, DOM, and dom4j. 
Jaxen was originally written by James Strachan and Bob McWhirter.
The primary impetus for beta 11 was fixing the build process so it once again generates source bundles. A couple of small, almost cosmetic, bugs were also fixed. 
If you haven't noticed any problems with beta 10, you can safely skip this iteration.
</p>

<p>
However, do not be fooled by the "beta" designation. 
This release has many fewer bugs and is <em>much</em> more 
conformant to the XPath specification than the official 1.0 release. I hope to release 1.1 final toward the end of the year after closing a few more bugs. 
However, there's no need to wait for that. If you're using Jaxen 1.0, you should upgrade to this beta.

The W3C GRDDL Working Group has posted the first public working draft of a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-grddl-primer-20061002/">GRDDL Primer</a>. 
According to the draft,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>GRDDL is a mechanism for <strong>G</strong>leaning
<strong>R</strong>esource <strong>D</strong>escriptions from
<strong>D</strong>ialects of <strong>L</strong>anguages. It is a technique
for obtaining RDF data from XML
documents and in particular XHTML pages. Authors may
explicitly associate documents with transformation algorithms, typically
represented in XSLT, using a <code>link</code> element in
the <code>head</code> of the document. Alternatively the information needed
to obtain the transformation may be held in an associated metadata profile
document or namespace document. Clients reading the document can follow their
nose using techniques described in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/grddl/">GRDDL specification</a> to discover the
appropriate transformations. This document uses a number of examples from the

<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-grddl-primer-20061002/#GRDDL-Draft">GRDDL Use Cases</a> document to illustrate in detail the
techniques GRDDL provides for associating documents with appropriate
instructions for extracting any embedded data.</p>

Stefano Mazzocchi has released <a href="http://simile.mit.edu/gadget/">Gadget</a>, an open source (BSD license) XML inspector based on XPath that
analyzes  XML documents too large 
to fit into RAM. According to Mazzocchi, "I was given the task of transforming a few hundred Mb of XML into RDF and I found out (the hard way!) that with that amount of data things start to break down: you need radically different approaches since you can't simply open your 100Mb XML document in your browser to take a look at it.

Before writing Gadget I used a collection of 12-stages-long grep+sed+sort+uniq pipelines to understand what I had in that big XML pile, but that started to become a little cumbersome so I wrote this."
Gadget is written in Java.

According to the abstract, "XHTML-Print is member of the family of XHTML languages defined by the <cite>Modularization of XHTML</cite> [XHTMLMOD]. It is designed to be appropriate for printing from mobile devices to low-cost printers that might not have a full-page buffer and that generally print from top-to-bottom and left-to-right with the paper in a portrait orientation. XHTML-Print is also targeted at printing in environments where it is not feasible or desirable to install a printer-specific driver and where some variability in the formatting of the output is acceptable." In essence, this subsets XHTML with the features appropriate for printing. 
For instance, frames are not supported because "Frames depend on a screen interface and therefore are not applicable to printers."

The W3C XML Processing Model Working Group has posted the first public working draft of 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-xproc-20060928/">XProc: An XML Pipeline Language</a>. According to the introduction,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An XML Pipeline specifies a sequence of operations to be
performed on a collection of input documents. Pipelines take zero
or more XML documents as their input and produce zero or more XML
documents as their output. Steps in the pipeline <span class="rfc2119">may</span> read or write non-XML resources as well.</p>
<p>A pipeline consists of components. Like pipelines, components
take zero or more XML documents as their input and produce zero or
more XML documents as their output. The inputs to a component come
from the web, from the pipeline document, from the inputs to the
pipeline itself, or from the outputs of other components in the
pipeline. The outputs from a component are consumed by other
components, are outputs of the pipeline as a whole, or are
discarded.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of components: steps and (language)
constructs. Steps carry out single operations and have no

Bob Stayton has written an <a href="http://www.sagehill.net/xml/docbook5ns/">experimental version of the DocBook XSL stylesheets</a> "in which the DocBook V5 namespace is used in element matches.  These stylesheets handle the DocBook 5 namespace natively, rather than using the nodeset() function to strip it out so the elements can be processed with the existing namespace-free templates. Avoiding the nodeset step avoids losing the xml:base of the document, among other things.  Also, with these stylesheets you can write a customization layer that uses the namespace in element matches."

Norm Walsh has published the eighth beta of
<a href="http://docbook.org/xml/5.0b8/">DocBook 5.0</a>.
DocBook 5 is 
"a significant redesign that attempts to remain true to the spirit of DocBook." 
The schema is written in 
RELAX NG. A DTD and W3C XML Schema generated from the RELAX NG schema are also available. There's also a Schematron schema "that validates some extra-grammatical DocBook constraints. These patterns are also present directly in the RELAX NG Grammar and some validators, for example MSV, can perform both kinds of validation at the same time."
Changes in this beta are quite minor, mostly bug fixes and some tightening up of the data types.

          <li>Ability to re-open accidentally closed tabs</li>
          <li>Better support for previewing and subscribing to web feeds</li>
          <li>Inline spell checking in forms (ironically the first word it flagged for me as misspelled was "Firefox")</li>
          <li>Search plugin manager</li>
<li><a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Microsummaries">Microsummaries</a> feature for bookmarks</li>
          <li>Automatic restoration of your browsing session if there is a crash</li>

          <li>New Windows installer</li>
          <li> <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/New_in_JavaScript_1.7">JavaScript 1.7</a></li>
          <li><a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#scs-client-side">Client-side session and persistent storage</a> (a really hideous idea, sure to be misused)</li>
          <li><code>svg:textPath</code></li>
</ul>

<p>
It's not immediately clear what's changed since beta 2, but presumably bugs were fixed. I've been using Firefox 2 as my primary browser since beta 1, and it's been pretty smooth over all.
The inline spell checking is indispensable, and worth the upgrade alone. 
The only problem I've encountered is that Chris Pederick's Web Developer plugin doesn't yet support FireFox 2, so occasionally I have to drop back to Firefox 1.5 to use it. 
Hopefully that will be updated soon.

The  W3C Web Application Formats Working Group has published the last call 
working draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-xbl-20060907/">XML Binding Language (XBL) 2.0</a>. 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
This specification describes the ability to map elements to script, event handlers, CSS, and more complex content models. This can be used to re-order and wrap content so that, for instance, simple HTML or XHTML markup can have complex CSS styles applied without requiring that the markup be polluted with multiple semantically neutral <code>div</code>  elements.
</p>

<p>
It can also be used to implement new DOM interfaces, and, in conjunction with other specifications, enables arbitrary tag sets to be implemented as widgets. For example, XBL could in theory be used to implement XForms.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This version is a non-backwards-compatible "revision of Mozilla's XBL 1.0 language, originally developed at Netscape in 2000, and originally implemented in the Gecko rendering engine"  developed by Mozilla, Opera, Google, and Apple. 
(Hmm, who's missing from that list?)
It's supposedly less Mozilla focused, more browser independent.
This is not the same as  the W3C's sXBL effort, and it's not immediately clear whether work on that will continue in parallel, or if this will replace it in the W3C standards track. Either way this looks very interesting, and I hope the W3c can navigate the rocky shores of browser compatibility to get something usefully implemented.

Code Synthesis has released <a href="http://codesynthesis.com/products/xsd/">xsd 2.3.0</a>, a free-as-in-speech (GPL)
W3C XML Schema language based data binding tool for C++.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given an XML
       instance description (XML Schema), it generates C++ classes that
       represent the given vocabulary as well as parsing and serialization
       code (collectively called a mapping or binding).
    </p>

    <p>Compared to APIs such as DOM and SAX, the generated code allows
       you to access the information in XML instance documents using
       your domain vocabulary instead of generic elements, attributes,
       and text. Static typing helps catch errors at compile-time rather
       than at run-time. Automatic code generation frees you for more
       interesting tasks while minimizing the effort needed to adopt
       your applications to changes in the document structure.
    </p>


    <p><i>xsd</i> supports two C++ mappings: in-memory <i>C++/Tree</i>

       and event-driven <i>C++/Parser</i>. The C++/Tree mapping consists
       of C++ classes that represent data types defined in XML Schema, a
       set of parsing functions that convert XML instance documents to a
       tree-like in-memory data structure, and a set of serialization
       functions that convert the in-memory representation back to XML....
    </p>

    <p>The C++/Parser mapping provides parser templates for data types
       defined in XML Schema. Using these parser templates you can build
       your own in-memory representations or perform immediate processing
       of XML instance documents.

2.3.0 allows the generated code to contain user-defined types and improves performance.

I'm skeptical of the schema-based, strong typing ideal that drives this project. Personally I'm much more interested in products that treat schemas as suggestions rather than strait jackets. For instance, I don't mind an editor using a schema to suggest auto-complete options; but I don't want it to freak out if I add an <code>xi:include</code> element that isn't accounted for by the schema or paste in some invalid (but well-formed) legacy HTML.

IBM's alphaWorks has updated the 
<a href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/xfg">XML Forms Generator</a>, a data-driven Eclipse plug-in that "generates forms that adhere to the XForms 1.0 standard, using as a starting point either Web Service Description Language (WSDL) documents or XML instance documents having optional XML Schema backing models. The generated forms adhere to the XHTML and XForms 1.0 standards and can be viewed in popular XHTML and XForms renderers." This release adds support for Eclipse 3.2 and a schema-flattening utility. 
</p>


<p>
IBM has also released the <a href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/vxd">Visual XForms Designer</a>, an Eclipse plug-in for graphically editing XForms.
This product sits on top of the
Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF), Graphical Editing Framework (GEF), and Eclipse Web Tools Platform (WTP). This release integrates the 
WTP XML Editor and supports Eclipse 3.2.
</p>

<p>
Both the XML Forms Generator and the Visual Forms Designer are
 part of the Emerging Technologies Toolkit (ETTK), which is a polite way of saying they're closed source and more than likely 
IBM will eventually abandon them without ever making them available for
production use; either as closed or open source.

I've 
posted beta 10
of <a href="http://jaxen.org/releases.html">Jaxen 1.1</a>, an open source 
(modified BSD license) XPath 1.0 engine for Java that is adaptable to many different object models including XOM, JDOM, DOM, and dom4j. 
Jaxen was originally written by James Strachan and Bob McWhirter.
Beta 10 fixes an assortment of small issues. 
</p>

<p>
Do not be fooled by the "beta" designation. 
This release has many fewer bugs and is <em>much</em> more 
conformant to the XPath specification than the official 1.0 release. I hope to release 1.1 final toward the end of the year after closing a few more bugs. 
However, there's no need to wait for that. If you're using Jaxen 1.0, you should upgrade to this beta.

<p>
Some students from several universities have undertaken to write <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/XML">an entire text book about XML in a Wiki</a>. 
Is this the future of textbook publishing? Maybe, but only if it attracts enough users to correct its mistakes and rewrite its language.  It could really use a thorough tech edit and a thorough copy edit. The lack of a single authorial voice, the frequent use of academic passive-speak, and the inconsistent and often inaccurate terminology are severe problems. Small technical mistakes are frequent, and there's at least one major flaw with the whole premise that underlies the book--excessive dependence on and faith in schemas. Probably some of this is precisely because the book was written by students learning XML rather than experts trying to teach XML.  I attempted to correct some of the more obvious howlers in the text, but the Wiki was acting up and kept giving me the wrong section to edit. 
</p>

<p>
I'm sure this was a valuable learning exercise for the students who wrote it. 
I'm tempted to assign a project like this to my own class one of these semesters.
How valuable it is for others trying to learn from it, I don't know. I'm probably too close to judge myself. I do recall that readers often seemed to appreciate the tone of my earlier books where I too was learning as I wrote more. They had  a real conversational, tutorial, we're all in this together approach that a lot of readers liked. My later books don't have as much of that. On the other hand, my early books also had a lot of small and large mistakes too, many of which still make me blanch when I read them today. This Wiki text is certainly superior to the first editions of the first books I wrote about XML; even if it's decidedly inferior to the more modern editions on store shelves now.
</p>

<p>
Of course, it's really not fair to compare the revised editions of my books to the first edition of the Wiki book.
  If the Wiki improves at the same rate as new editions of paper books do (and it might well improve faster) then it could be a real challenge to existing books like the <a href="books/bible3/">XML Bible</a> or <a href="books/xian3/">XML in a Nutshell</a>.
If nothing else the project (which includes many other textbooks besides XML) 
should help control the exorbitant price of college texts. It may also finally give some old dinosaurs like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0471232319/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/">Halliday and Resnick</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0471000051/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/">Apostol</a>, or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=047130932X/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/">Jackson</a> a run for their money. That would be a very good thing.

 Michael Kay has released version 8.8 of Saxon, his XSLT 2.0 and XQuery processor for Java and .NET. According to Kay, "There's a long list of changes at
<a href="http://www.saxonica.com/documentation/changes/intro.html">http://www.saxonica.com/documentation/changes/intro.html</a> but most of them
taken individually are fairly small. Saxon now achieves 100% pass rates in
both the W3C XQuery and XSLT 2.0 test suites (a unique achievement), and
many of the changes that were needed to reach this target are in obscure
corner cases that very few users are likely to notice. (Do you really care
about the difference between a float NaN and a double NaN? - the conformance
tests do.)" New features include:
</p>


<ul>
	<li>An implementation of the draft  XQuery API for Java</li>

	<li>The default collation for XSLT sorting is now Unicode codepoint collation.</li>

	<li>Extension functions written in C# or other .NET languages can now be invoked fron the .NET version</li>

	<li>In XSLT, the namespace URI for newly-constructed elements and attributes must now be a valid URI.</li>

	<li> The serialization pipeline is now  configurable by a user-specified <code>SerializerFactory</code> class</li>
</ul>


<p>
Saxon is published in two versions for both of which 
Java 1.4 or later (or .NET) is required.
<a href="http://saxon.sf.net/">Saxon 8.8B</a> is an open source product  
published under the Mozilla Public License 1.0 that 
"implements the 'basic' conformance level for XSLT 2.0 and XQuery."
Saxon <a href="http://www.saxonica.com/">8.8SA</a> is a 
£250.00 payware version that "allows stylesheets and queries to import an XML Schema, to validate input and output trees against a schema, and to select elements and attributes based on their schema-defined type. Saxon-SA also incorporates a free-standard XML Schema validator.
In addition Saxon-SA incorporates some advanced extensions not available in the Saxon-B product. These include a try/catch capability for catching dynamic errors, improved error diagnostics, support for higher-order functions, and additional facilities in XQuery including support for grouping, advanced regular expression analysis, and formatting of dates and numbers."

The W3C XML Schema Working Group has posted the third public working draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-xmlschema11-1-20060831/">XML Schema 1.1 Part 1: Structures</a>. According to the introduction to the structures spec,
</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
		
			The Working Group has three main goals for this version of W3C XML Schema:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			
				Significant improvements in simplicity of design and clarity of exposition 
				<em>
					without
				</em>
				loss of backward 
				<em>
					or
				</em>
				forward compatibility; 
			
		</li>
		<li>
			
				Provision of support for versioning of XML languages defined using the XML Schema specification, including the XML transfer syntax for schemas itself.
		</li>
		<li>
			
				Provision of support for co-occurrence constraints, that is constraints which make the presence of an attribute or element, or the values allowable for it, depend on the value or presence of other attributes or elements.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		
			These goals are in tension with one another. The Working Group's strategic guidelines for changes between versions 1.0 and 1.1 can be summarized as follows:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			
				Support for versioning (acknowledging that this 
				<em>
					may
				</em>
				be slightly disruptive to the XML transfer syntax at the margins)
		</li>
		<li>
			
				Support for co-occurrence constraints (which will certainly involve additions to the XML transfer syntax, which will not be understood by 1.0 processors)
		</li>
		<li>
			
				Bug fixes (unless in specific cases we decide that the fix is too disruptive for a point release)
		</li>
		<li>
			
				Editorial changes
		</li>
		<li>
			
				Design cleanup will possibly change behavior in edge cases
		</li>
		<li>
			
				Non-disruptive changes to type hierarchy (to better support current and forthcoming international standards and W3C recommendations)
		</li>
		<li>
			
				Design cleanup will possibly change component structure (changes to functionality restricted to edge cases)
		</li>
		<li>
			
				No significant changes in existing functionality
		</li>
		<li>
			
				No changes to XML transfer syntax except those required by version control hooks, co-occurrence constraints and bug fixes
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		
			The aim with regard to compatibility is that
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			
				All schema documents conformant to version 1.0 of this specification should also conform to version 1.1, and should have the same validation behavior across 1.0 and 1.1 implementations (except possibly in edge cases and in the details of the resulting PSVI);
		</li>
		<li>
			
				The vast majority of schema documents conformant to version 1.1 of this specification should also conform to version 1.0, leaving aside any incompatibilities arising from support for versioning or co-occurrence constraints, and when they are conformant to version 1.0 (or are made conformant by the removal of versioning information), should have the same validation behavior across 1.0 and 1.1 implementations (again except possibly in edge cases and in the details of the resulting PSVI);
		</li>
	</ul>
</blockquote>

Changes since the last working draft appear to be quite technical.

"The RC1 build includes improvements in performance, stability, security, and application compatibility.  You may not notice many visible changes from the Beta 3 release; all we did was listen to your feedback, fix bugs that you reported, and make final adjustments to our CSS support. I do want to call attention to two changes in particular. First, IE7 RC1 setup automatically detects and uninstalls previous IE7 betas before trying to install IE7 so you don’t have to. We’ll post more detail on the install/uninstall process very soon.

Second, IE7 RC1 will automatically detect add-ons with known stability or compatibility problems so that end users can easily get a newer version or temporarily turn the add-on off. "

The W3C 
 XML Query Working Group and the XSL Working Group
have released  version 1.0 of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/Query/test-suite/">XML Query Test Suite (XQTS)</a>.
According to Andrew Eisenberg,
</p>
<blockquote>

<p>
We encourage implementors to run this test suite and request that they provide feedback to us by Sept. 29, 2006. If enough positive results are received, then we will be able to request a transition to Proposed Recommendation. During this period we will continue to respond to bug reports and will likely issue one or two point releases of the test suite.
</p>

<p>
In this release, we have added 230 test cases, including a small number of tests for fn:collection. We have changed the way that tests of fn:doc and tests that expect a context item from the host environment are expressed in our catalog (spelled out in Guidelines for Running the XQuery Test Suite).
</p>

<p>
We request that submittors re-read our guidelines if they have not done so recently and  follow the guidelines for the transformation of queries and for the comparison of results as closely as possible. While we have provided a mechanism for submittors to tell us about any deviations that have been made, we hope that this will be used sparingly.
</p>

<p>
To date, we have received the results for several implementations of XQuery: Saxon-SA, xq2xsl, X-Hive/DB, xbird/open, XQuest,Qizx/open, and one anonymous implementation. A report that reflects these results is available from our web page. We will update this report as new results are received. We encourage implementors to send us results early, and then to update their results as their implementations progress.

<a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-crisp-iris-xpc-04.txt">XML Pipelining with Chunks</a> for the Information Registry Information Service.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
This transfer protocol defines simple framing for sending XML in
   chunks so that XML fragments may be acted upon (or pipelined) before
   the reception of the entire XML instance.  This document calls this
   XML pipelining with chunks (XPC) and its use with IRIS as IRIS-XPC.
</p>

<p>
   XPC is for use with simple request and response interactions between
   clients and servers.  Clients send a series of requests to a server
   in data blocks.  The server will respond to each data block
   individually with a corresponding data block, but through the same
   connection.  Request and response data blocks are sent using the TCP
   SEND function and received using the TCP RECEIVE function.
</p>

<p>
   The lifecycle of an XPC session has the following phases:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>  A client establishes a TCP connection with a server.</li>

	<li>  The server sends a connection response block (CRB).</li>

	<li>  The client sends a request block (RQB).  In this request, the client can set a "keep open" flag requesting that the server keep the XPC session open following the response to this request.</li>

	<li>  The server responds with a response block (RSB).  In this response, the server can indicate to the client whether or not the XPC session will be closed.</li>

	<li>  If the XPC session is not to be terminated, then the lifecycle repeats from step 3.</li>

	<li>  The TCP connection is closed.</li>
</ol>

</blockquote>


<p>
What I'm confused about is why it's necessary to send XML fragments. Why not just send multiple small documents instead? What they're proposing may be reasonable, but at first read it gives me the willies. There may be deep flaws here. If nothing else, existing XML APIs like DOM, XOM, and SAX really aren't designed to handle semi-independent fragments. Furthermore the draft doesn't seem to address what happens to the remaining chunks when one is malformed. That's a huge omission that likely has security implications. Finally, this whole protocol feels like it deeply mixes layers that should stay independent. 
Comments are due today.

The W3C  Web Application Formats  Working Group

</p>

<blockquote>
<p><dfn>Application Packaging</dfn> is the process of bundling an application and its resources into an archive format (eg. a <code>.zip</code> file [<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-WAPF-REQ-20060821/#ref-zip">ZIP</a>]) for the purpose of distribution and deployment. 
	A package bundle usually includes a <dfn>manifest</dfn>, which is a set of instructions that tell a host runtime environment 
	how to install and run the packaged application. Application packaging is 
	used on both the server-side, as is the case with Sun's <abbr title="Java Platform Enterprise Edition">JEE</abbr> <code>.war</code> files and <code>.ear</code> files and Microsoft's .NET <code>.cab</code> files, 
	and on the client-side, as is the case with widgets such as those distributed by Apple, Opera, Yahoo! and Microsoft.</p>

	
	<p>Currently, there is no standardized way to package an application for distribution 
		and deployment on the web. 
		Each vendor has come up with their own solution to what is essentially the same problem (see <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-WAPF-REQ-20060821/#appendix">Appendix</a>). 
		The working group hopes that by standardising application packaging authors 
		will be able to distribute and deploy their applications across a variety of platforms 
		in a standardized manner that is both easy to use and device independent.</p>

Alex Milowski  is working on <a href="https://smallx.dev.java.net/">smallx</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p> library and set of tools that is being developed to process XML infosets.  It has two distinct features in that the infoset implementation allows streaming of documents and that processing of infosets can be accomplished using a concept called pipelines.  The library contains a full compliment of technologies--include XPath and XSLT.</p>
<p>Pipelines provide the ability to chain together different components that perform different tasks to process a XML document.  Some of these tasks might be decision points in the processing while other might transform the input (e.g. XSLT).  All components in the pipeline have the ability to stream the infoset it they so choose.</p>
<p>The key difference of this code over others is that it allows streaming of infosets to be mixed in with non-streamed document-based processing.  This allows large data sets to be processed in a minimal amount of memory while allowing traditional technologies like XSLT to still be used.</p> 
<p>For example, in the following pipeline:</p>
<pre class="example">&lt;p:pipe xmlns:p="http://www.smallx.com/Vocabulary/Pipeline/2005/1/0" name="scoped-xslt"&gt;
&lt;p:subtree select="/doc/part/subsection"&gt;

&lt;p:xslt src="translate.xsl"/&gt;
&lt;/p:subtree&gt;
&lt;/p:pipe&gt;
</pre>
<p>the XSLT transform "translate.xsl" is limited to only the elements that match the "/doc/part/subsection" XPath.  Every other part of the document "flows" around the XSLT in a streaming fashion so that only the subsection subtree needs to be built and passed to XSLT.  In the end, the pipeline puts all the pieces back together in the right order.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Again, whether this is the right implementation of this idea, I don't yet know.

IBM's alphaWorks has released <acronym title="XML Enhancements for Java"><a href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/xj">XJ</a></acronym>,
a derivative of the Java programming language 1.4 that
builds in native support for XML (like C&omega; does for C#).
"In XJ, one 
can import XML schemas just as one does Java classes.  All the element 
declarations in the XML schema are then available to programmers as if 
they were Java classes.  Programmers can write inline XPath expressions on 
these classes, and the compiler checks them for correctness with respect 
to the XML schema.  In addition, it performs optimizations to improve the 
evaluation of XPath expressions.  A programmer may construct new XML 
documents by writing XML directly inline.  Again, the compiler ensures 
correctness with respect to the appropriate schema."
It sounds interesting, but the tight coupling to schemas is a serious mistake. 
I want my XPaths and XML literals to work regardless of what the schema says. Indeed the schema agnosticity of both XML and XPath is one of their strengths. 
It's disturbing how many people keep trying to force the schemaless genie back into the bottle.

 The new editions just incorporate various errata. I skimmed the changes. Most of them don't look too serious or likely to cause problems. There is one nasty one (rewriting history to put the <code>xmlns</code> prefix in a namespace) but that's been a problem for a long time. Moving that decision from the errata page to the core spec doesn't really change anything. If anything, it's more honest since we can now specify tools as supporting the first or second edition of Namespaces in XML rather than pretending there's really only one variant.

Dimitre Novatchev  has released <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/fxsl">FXSL 2.0, v2</a>.  FXSL is a library for implementing functional programming in XSLT provides XSLT through a 
 reusable set of functions, a means of  implementing higher-order functions and using those functions as first class objects in XSLT. New features in this release include:
</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Almost all standard XPath 2.0 functions (F &amp; O) have now higher-order FXSL wrappers</strong> that makes possible to use them as higher order functions and to create partial applications from them. 
</li><li><strong>Some standard XSLT 2.0 functions and instructions have now higher-order FXSL wrappers</strong> that makes possible to use them as higher order functions and to create partial applications from them. 
</li><li><strong>All standard XPath 2.0 operators (F &amp; O) have now higher-order FXSL wrappers</strong> that makes possible to use them as higher order functions and to create partial applications from them. 
</li><li><strong>All standard XPath 2.0 constructors have now higher-order FXSL wrappers</strong> that makes possible to use them as higher order functions and to create partial applications from them. 

</li><li><strong>Currying and partial application uses dynamic type detection of the arguments</strong> of the function. On the final evaluation of the function when all arguments have been specified the typed values of the arguments are reconstructed using the recorded type information."</li></ul>

Alex Moffat's
<a href="http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/xsltxt">XSLTXT</a> is a compact, non-XML syntax for XSLT. Think of it as doing for XSLT what RNC does for RELAX NG. 
It's an interesting idea. It may especially appeal to Python folks. I'm not sure I like it, but then I'm, more than usually comfortable with both XSLT and XML. I even prefer RNG to RNC. XSLTXT includes translators to and from XSLTXT. It's published under the

has updated the working draft of 
 <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-i18n-html-tech-lang-20060721/">Internationalization Best Practices: Specifying Language in XHTML &amp; HTML Content</a>. 
According to the draft,
"Specifying the language of content is useful for a wide number of applications, from linguistically sensitive searching to applying language-specific display properties. In some cases the potential applications for language information are still waiting for implementations to catch up, whereas in others, such as detection of language by voice browsers, it is a necessity today. On the other hand, adding markup for language information to content is something that can and should be done today. Without it, it will not be possible to take advantage of any future developments." 
This advice is summarized in 16 "best practices:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Best Practice 1: Always declare language in the <code>html</code> tag</li>
	<li>Best Practice 2: <code>html</code>-based declarations for multilingual audiences</li>
	<li>Best Practice 3: Declare language changes inside the document</li>
	<li>Best Practice 4: Should I use the <code>lang</code> or <code>xml:lang</code> attribute?</li>
	<li>Best Practice 5: Don't rely on Content-Language for text-processing</li>
	<li>Best Practice 6: Don't use the <code>body</code> tag instead of the <code>html</code> tag</li>
	<li>Best Practice 7: When attribute and element content are in different languages</li>
	<li>Best Practice 8: Use HTTP or a  <code>meta</code> tag for metadata</li>
	<li>Best Practice 9: Provide a comma-separated list of languages</li>
	<li>Best Practice 10: Division of multilingual docs</li>
	<li>Best Practice 11: Use RFC3066bis or its successor</li>
	<li>Best Practice 12: Use short language tags</li>
	<li>Best Practice 13: Use <code>Hans</code> and <code>Hant</code> codes</li>
	<li>Best Practice 14: Pros and cons of identifying the language</li>
	<li>Best Practice 15: Using <code>hreflang</code> with CSS</li>

The W3C HTML working group has posted the first public working draft of 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-xhtml-role-20060725/">XHTML Role Attribute Module</a>.
</p>

<blockquote><p>
The role attribute takes as its value one or more white-space separated <span class="datatype"><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-modularization/abstraction.html#dt_QName">QName</a></span>s. The attribute describes the role(s) the current element plays in the context of the document. It is used by
applications and assistive technologies to determine the purpose of UI widgets. In the case of a web page it may be declarative as a function of particular elements or it may be an attribute which is
configurable by the page author. Additionally, role information may be used to define each action which may be performed on an element. This allows a user to make informed decisions on which actions
may be taken on an element and activate the selected action in a device independent way.</p>

<div class="example">
<pre>&lt;ul role="navigation wai:sitemap"&gt;
    &lt;li href="downloads"&gt;Downloads&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li href="docs"&gt;Documentation&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li href="news"&gt;News&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</pre>
</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
Defined roles include:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>main</li>
	<li>secondary</li>
	<li>navigation</li>
	<li>banner</li>
	<li>contentinfo</li>
	<li>note</li>
	<li>seealso</li>
	<li>search</li>
</ul>



<p>You can add other values for this attribute
by placing the vlaues in a namespace. (Haven't we learned yet that namespaced attribute values are a <strong>bad</strong> idea?)

DocBook 5 is 
"a significant redesign that attempts to remain true to the spirit of DocBook."

These patterns are also present directly in the RELAX NG Grammar and some validators, for example MSV, can perform both kinds of validation at the same time."
Changes in this beta are quite minor and include

The W3C Scalable Vector Graphics Working 
Group has posted a fourth
last call working draft of
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-SVGMobile12-20060721/">Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) Tiny 1.2</a>. SVG Tiny is a "modularized language for describing two-dimensional vector and mixed vector/raster graphics in XML. SVG Tiny 1.2 is the baseline profile of SVG, implementable on a range of devices from cellphones and PDAs to desktop and laptop computers, and is the core of SVG 1.2. Other SVG 1.2 specifications will extend this functionality to form supersets (for example, SVG 1.2 Full)."

<a href="http://www.formfaces.com/main.html">FormFaces 1.0</a>, a pure JavaScript XForms processor, has been released.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
FormFaces<sup>TM</sup> is a <b>pure JavaScript solution</b> that <b>utilizes AJAX</b> techniques and can be seamlessly <b>integrated with AJAX applications</b>. This means that XForms+HTML can be sent directly to the browser where JavaScript transcodes the XForms controls to HTML form controls and processes the binding directly within the browser - requiring <b>ZERO server-side processing</b> and <b>ZERO plug-ins</b>. This is extremely simple to use, just insert the following tag into your XForms+HTML document:
</p>

<p>
                              <code>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="formfaces.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></p>

<p>
 The FormFaces<sup>TM</sup> JavaScript is compatible with browsers that implement XHTML 1.0, ECMA-262 3rd Edition, and DOM Level 2 which includes <b>Internet Explorer, Netscape, Mozilla, FireFox, Opera, Konquerer, Safari,</b> and <b>NetFront</b>. To this end, the new FormFaces<sup>TM</sup> framework enables:</p>

                              <ul>
                                <li class="list"><b>Cross-browser support</b> - existing client-side browser can be used.</li>

                                <li class="list"><b>Server-side technology agnostic</b> - the same forms can be used across disparate frameworks such as Java and .Net</li>

                                <li><b>Offline mode</b> - user interaction does not require server round-trips</li>

                              </ul>

</blockquote>

<p>
This looks very interesting. I really need to explore this further and see if it actually works. This has the potential to be a real game changer. (If only XForms supported PUT and DELETE...)  
FormFaces is published under both free (GPL) and non-free licenses.

Code Synthesis has released <a href="http://codesynthesis.com/products/xsd/">xsd 2.2.0</a>, a free-as-in-speech (GPL)
W3C XML Schema language based data binding tool for C++.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given an XML
       instance description (XML Schema), it generates C++ classes that
       represent the given vocabulary as well as parsing and serialization
       code (collectively called a mapping or binding).
    </p>

    <p>Compared to APIs such as DOM and SAX, the generated code allows
       you to access the information in XML instance documents using
       your domain vocabulary instead of generic elements, attributes,
       and text. Static typing helps catch errors at compile-time rather
       than at run-time. Automatic code generation frees you for more
       interesting tasks while minimizing the effort needed to adopt
       your applications to changes in the document structure.
    </p>


    <p><i>xsd</i> supports two C++ mappings: in-memory <i>C++/Tree</i>

       and event-driven <i>C++/Parser</i>. The C++/Tree mapping consists
       of C++ classes that represent data types defined in XML Schema, a
       set of parsing functions that convert XML instance documents to a
       tree-like in-memory data structure, and a set of serialization
       functions that convert the in-memory representation back to XML....
    </p>

    <p>The C++/Parser mapping provides parser templates for data types
       defined in XML Schema. Using these parser templates you can build
       your own in-memory representations or perform immediate processing
       of XML instance documents.

2.2.0 adds  streaming XML serialization and binary serialization.

The <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> object has been implemented for many years

    implementations are not completely interoperable. Based on those early
    implementations this specification defines how a common subset of

    changes in said implementations leading to more interoperable and useful
    implementations of the <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> object.</p>

The W3C Web Services Activity.
has posted the first public working draft of 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-sawsdl-20060630/">Semantic Annotations for WSDL</a>. According to the draft,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Semantic Annotations in WSDL Version 1.0 (SAWSDL) defines how to add semantic annotations to WSDL 2.0 components. The specification defines extension attributes that can be applied to both WSDL elements and XML Schema elements to annotate input and output messages defined in a WSDL 2.0 interface.
</p>

<p>
Semantic annotations are references from an element within a WSDL or XML Schema document to a concept in an ontology. This specification defines annotation mechanisms for relating WSDL inputs and outputs to concepts defined in an outside ontology. Similarly, it defines how to annotate WSDL operations and how to categorize WSDL interfaces. Further, it defines an annotation mechanism for specifying the structural mapping of XML Schema types to and from an ontology. The annotation mechanism is independent of the ontology expression language and this specification requires no particular ontology language.

The  W3C Web Application Formats Working Group has published the first official working draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-xbl-20060619/">XML Binding Language (XBL) 2.0</a>. 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
This specification describes the ability to map elements to script, event handlers, CSS, and more complex content models. This can be used to re-order and wrap content so that, for instance, simple HTML or XHTML markup can have complex CSS styles applied without requiring that the markup be polluted with multiple semantically neutral div  elements.
</p>

<p>
It can also be used to implement new DOM interfaces, and, in conjunction with other specifications, enables arbitrary tag sets to be implemented as widgets. For example, XBL could in theory be used to implement XForms.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This version is a non-backwards-compatible "revision of Mozilla's XBL 1.0 language, originally developed at Netscape in 2000, and originally implemented in the Gecko rendering engine"  developed by Mozilla, Opera, Google, and Apple. 
(Hmm, who's missing from that list?)
It's supposed less Mozilla foxused,. more browser independent.
This is not the same as  the W3C's sXBL effort, and it's not immediately clear whether work on that will continue in parallel, or if this will replace it in the W3C standards track. Eityher way this looks very interesting, and I hope the W3c can navigate the rocky shores of browser compatibility to get something usefully implemented.

John Cowan has released  <a href="http://www.ccil.org/~cowan/XML/tagsoup">TagSoup 1.0.1</a>,
an open source, Java-language, SAX parser for nasty, ugly HTML. According to Cowan,
"Previous versions of TagSoup always ignored whitespace in elements
that don't have PCDATA as a possible child. Now, if you turn on the
ignorableWhitespaceFeature (or use the --ignorable option), that
whitespace will be returned to your application through the previously
unused ContentHandler.ignorableWhitespace callback. This isn't done by
default for backwards compatibility, and also because HTML is an SGML
application and SGML parsers routinely dropped such whitespace."
This release also fixes a couple of bugs where TagSoup could report malformed comments and public identifiers.

Sometime in the last 24 hours some virus or spammer started using 
the cafeconleche.org domain as the from address in its messages.
Consequently I began getting a plethora of bounces. 
I don't actually use any e-mail addresses in the cafeconleche.org domain so 
I just cancelled the MX record that forwards everything to my 
real e-mail address. Feel free to drop e-mails from cafeconleche.org in the bit bucket if that helps you out.
</p>

<p>
One side note: in 2006 why are spam programs still sending out non-delivery messages? About half the crap I get is from spam filters that feel obliged to tell me that they filtered my spam. Any vendor who doesn't recopgnize by now that spam and viruses use forged e-mail addresses is simply incompetent and deserves to be black-holed into oblivion.

The W3C WebCGM Working Group has posted the first public working draft of 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-webcgm20-20060623/">WebCGM 2.0</a>, an updated version of the ISO Computer Graphics Metafile standard (ISO/IEC 8632:1999).
"WebCGM 2.0 adds a DOM (API) specification for programmatic access to WebCGM objects, and a specification of an XML Companion File (XCF) architecture, for externalization of non-graphical metadata. WebCGM 2.0, in addition, builds upon and extends the graphical and intelligent content of WebCGM 1.0, delivering functionality that was forecast for WebCGM 1.0, but was postponed in order to get the standard and its implementations to users expeditiously."
Personally I thought this had been superseded by <acronym>SVG</acronym>, and was now a purely legacy format.

In related news, Michael Kay has released version 8.7.3 of Saxon, his XSLT 2.0 and XQuery processor for Java and .NET. According to Kay, "This maintenance release clears 35 documented bugs, and on .NET it adds the
capability to process a DOM Document "in situ" rather than by first copying
it to create a Saxon tree."
</p>

<p>
Saxon is published in two versions for both of which 
Java 1.4 or later (or .NET) is required.
<a href="http://saxon.sf.net/">Saxon 8.7B</a> is an open source product  
published under the Mozilla Public License 1.0 that 
"implements the 'basic' conformance level for XSLT 2.0 and XQuery."
Saxon <a href="http://www.saxonica.com/">8.7SA</a> is a 
£250.00 payware version that "allows stylesheets and queries to import an XML Schema, to validate input and output trees against a schema, and to select elements and attributes based on their schema-defined type. Saxon-SA also incorporates a free-standard XML Schema validator.
In addition Saxon-SA incorporates some advanced extensions not available in the Saxon-B product. These include a try/catch capability for catching dynamic errors, improved error diagnostics, support for higher-order functions, and additional facilities in XQuery including support for grouping, advanced regular expression analysis, and formatting of dates and numbers."

The W3C XHTML working group has posted the first public working draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-xhtml-basic-20060607/">XHTML Basic 1.1</a>. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The <acronym title="Extensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</acronym> Basic document type includes the minimal set of modules required to be an <acronym title="Extensible HyperText Markup 
Language">XHTML</acronym> host language document type, and in addition it includes images, forms, basic tables, and object support. It is designed for Web clients that do not support the full set of
<acronym title="Extensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</acronym> features; for example, Web clients such as mobile phones, <acronym title="Personal Digital Assistant">PDA</acronym>s, pagers, and
settop boxes. The document type is rich enough for content authoring.</p>

<p><acronym title="Extensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</acronym> Basic is designed as a common base that may be extended. The goal of <acronym title="Extensible HyperText Markup Language">
XHTML</acronym> Basic is to serve as a common language supported by various kinds of user agents.</p>

<p>This revision, 1.1, supercedes version 1.0 as defined in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-xhtml-basic-20001219">http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-xhtml-basic-20001219</a>. In this revision, four
new features have been incorporated into the language in order to better serve the small-device community that is this language's major user:</p>

<ol>
<li>Intrinsic Events (defined in [<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xhtml-modularization-20010410">XHTMLMOD</a>])</li>

<li>The target attribute (defined in [<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xhtml-modularization-20010410">XHTMLMOD</a>])</li>

<li>The style element (defined in [<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xhtml-modularization-20010410">XHTMLMOD</a>])</li>

<li>The inputmode attribute (defined in <a href="#s_inputmode">Section 5</a> of this document)</li>
</ol>

<p>The document type definition is implemented using <acronym title="Extensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</acronym> modules as defined in "<cite><acronym title="Extensible HyperText Markup 
Language">XHTML</acronym> Modularization</cite>" [<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xhtml-modularization-20010410">XHTMLMOD</a>].</p>

<a href="http://docbook.org/xml/5.0b6/">DocBook 5.0</a>
DocBook 5 is 
"a significant redesign that attempts to remain true to the spirit of DocBook." 
The schema is written in 
RELAX NG. A DTD and W3C XML Schema generated from the RELAX NG schema are also available. There's also a Schematron schema "that validates some extra-grammatical DocBook constraints. These patterns are also present directly in the RELAX NG Grammar and some validators, for example MSV, can perform both kinds of validation at the same time."
This beta allows MathML and SVG in <code>imagedata</code> and improves support for aspect-oriented programming source code in DocBook documents.

As you may recall, I wrote <a href="books/xmljava/">Processing XML with Java</a> in DocBook 4. 
 I've been playing with DocBook 5 lately for a couple of possible future book projects. While it's clearly an improvement over DocBook 4 in numerous ways&mdash;for instance it uses namespaces, embeds SVG and MathML, and has reasonable XInclude support&mdash;the tool chain isn't up to snuff yet. The stylesheets and various editors like Oxygen haven't adapted to life in a DocBook 5 world yet. I'll probably continue to use DocBook 5 because I'm a bleeding edge sort of guy, but most users should stick to DocBook 4 for the time being.

an open source, Java-language, SAX parser for nasty, ugly HTML.
I use TagSoup to convert JavaDoc to well-formed XHTML.

<blockquote>
<p>
Mike Bremford sent me a patch that causes TagSoup to send the system and public IDs to the LexicalHandler if there is a DOCTYPE declaration present in the input. Formerly, DOCTYPE declarations were simply ignored. This patch is too good to reject even at this stage, and with a few emendations it passed all my acceptance tests, so I've incorporated it.
</p>

<p>
In addition, the last known remaining bug was removed. In the last few releases, the script element was allowed to be a root element (a by-product of allowing it anywhere). Now it will be wrapped in an html element instead. This eliminates some random newlines that were being added at the end of such a root-level script element as well.

I'm sorry, but that last one is just plain wrong. It's like cookies but worse. 
Apparently someone noticed that cookies don't actually do what they're supposed to do  (Well, duh; but what do you expect when you completely violate one of the fundamental principles of the Web architecture?), but rather than turning around and figuring out how HTTP is supposed to work, (Hint: the lack of sessions is a feature--not a bug.) these incompetents have gone even further in the wrong direction.
I know that in 1995 a lot of people back then didn't really understand the Web. This certainly included myself and the Netscape engineers who invented cookies. However I thought we'd learned a few things in the last 10 years. At least I did. I'm sorry to see that browser vendors didn't. At least Microsoft didn't sign on for this one (though Apple, Google, and Opera did). Maybe this time <acronym>IE</acronym> will uncharacteristically serve as a bulwark of sanity against this particularly stupidity.

The W3C Web API working group has posted the first public working draft 
of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-selectors-api-20060525/">Selectors API</a>. "It is often desirable to perform script and or DOM operations on a specific set of elements in a document. [Selectors], mostly used in CSS  [CSS21] context, provides a way of matching such a set of elements. This specification introduces two methods which take a selector (technically a group of selectors) as argument and return the matched elements as result." The spec offers the following JavaScript example:
</p>

<pre>function resolver(str) {
  var prefixes = {
    xh:  "http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml",
    svg: "http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"}
  return prefixes[str];
}
var <var>a</var> = document.matchAll("xh|div &gt; svg|svg", resolver);
var <var>b</var> = document.match("div.foo.bar");</pre>


<p>
I'm not sure why they've chosen the weak CSS syntax insetad of the much more powerful and expressive XPath. Among other things, using XPath would allow colons to be used in qualified names instead of these weird vertical bars. Other things being equal, consistency of syntax should be preferred. Perhaps it needs to handle malformed HTML?

John Cowan tells me I'm all wrong about the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-access-control-20060517/">Authorizing Read Access to XML Content Using the &lt;?access-control?&gt; Processing Instruction 1.0</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Here's the scenario.  You surf to a web page containing an applet (Java
or Flash or whatever) downloaded from foo.com.  Your browser will run
that applet, but will only trust it to access content hosted on foo.com.
This is good for security on your system -- a malicious applet can't grab
confidential content from your behind-the-firewall servers and pipe it
back to the applet's host -- but it makes the applet rather inflexible:
any public data it needs to read has to be mirrored on its host.
</p>

<p>
Now comes this specification, and tells the browser that if the document
contains &lt;?access-control allow="foo.com"?>, then the browser should let
the applet read that document just as if the document resided on foo.com.
It has absolutely nothing to do with whether browsers at foo.com can
themselves read the document or not -- anyone can read the document by
running trusted code.  The PI says that this document can be read even
by untrusted code from specific sources.
</p>

<p>
It's also possible to use wildcards in the access-control PI to allow
access by applets from anywhere, or from a set of hosts.
</p>

</blockquote>


<p>
That's a little more sensible, but only a little. This is still a security problem. First of all, it allows the web page to say that it's OK to use applets (or JavaScript, or whatever) to launch a DOS attack on it. Secondly the limitations on applets talking to third party hosts aren't just for the protection of the third party hosts. They exist to protect the client system too. I'm not sure a client should routinely trust an applet to talk to server X because server Y says it's OK.

The W3C Voice Browser, Web APIs and Web Application Formats (WAF) Working Groups have worked together to release a specification so colossally brain damaged it could not possibly have been designed by a single group. I am referring to, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-access-control-20060517/">Authorizing Read Access to XML Content Using the &lt;?access-control?&gt; Processing Instruction 1.0</a>. In brief, "This note describes a mechanism being used in the industry that allows a content provider to use a processing instruction embedded within the XML prolog to specify the access policy of that content. In this model a user agent can safely extend the sandbox in which it has restricted the application to include access to the XML content if and only if the specified policy grants permission." For example,
you would put the processing instruction <code>&lt;?access-control allow="www.sun.com" deny="www.microsoft.com"?></code> in a document prolog, and Sun can read it but Microsoft can't. 
In other words, the client is supposed to trust the document it receives because that document says to trust it? Or in reverse, the server is supposed to believe that the client will obey any restrictions placed in the document? I keep thinking they can't possibly mean what they say, but they really seem to. At best this is a very poorly written specification that doesn'tt explain what it's actually trying to do. At worst, it's the single most broken security design I've seen in years, and that's saying a lot.

The W3C Semantic Web Best Practices and Deployment Working Group  and HTML Working Groups have joined forces to publish <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-xhtml-rdfa-primer-20060516/">RDFa Primer 1.0</a>.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
 Current web pages, written in HTML, are chock-full of structured data. When publishers can express the document's metadata, and when tools can read it, a new world of user functionality becomes available, letting users copy and paste structured data between applications and web sites. An event on a web page can be directly imported into a user's desktop calendar. A license on a document can be automatically detected so that the user is informed of his rights automatically. A photo's creator, camera setting information, resolution, and topic can be published to enable structured search and sharing.
</p>

<p>
RDFa is a syntax for expressing such metadata in XHTML. The rendered, hypertext data of XHTML is reused by the RDFa markup, so that publishers don't repeat themselves. The underlying abstract metadata representation is RDF, which lets publishers build their own metadata vocabulary, extend others, and evolve their vocabulary with maximal interoperability over time. The metadata is closely tied to the data it describes, so that rendered data can be copied and pasted along with its relevant structure. 
</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
Here's  asyntax example from the draft:
</p>

<pre><code>&lt;h1 property="dc:title">Vacation in the South of France&lt;/h1>
&lt;h2>created 
  by &lt;span property="dc:creator">Mark Birbeck&lt;/span>
  on &lt;span property="dc:date" type="xsd:date"
           content="2006-01-02">
    January 2nd, 2006
     &lt;/span>
&lt;/h2></code></pre>

<p>
The thing that jumps out at me are the use of namespace prefixes in attribute values. Haven't we learned by now that this is a bad idea?

John Cowan has posted the sixth release candidate of <a href="http://www.ccil.org/~cowan/XML/tagsoup">TagSoup</a>,
an open source, Java-language, SAX parser for nasty, ugly HTML.
I use TagSoup to convert JavaDoc to well-formed XHTML. 
RC6 focuses on namespaces. According to Cowan, 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
This release fixed a bunch of bugs around namespaces. The SAX 
spec was a little hard to follow, so I am now doing a subset of 
what Xerces does, in hopes that that will be compatible with 
what most SAX applications expect. In particular, the 
namespace-prefixes feature is now false by default, as it should 
be, and cannot be made true. It used to be true by default, but 
did not meet the contract that implies, namely that xmlns: 
attributes would be provided to the application.
</p>

<p>
This also involved fixing a bug in XMLWriter that made it work 
incorrectly when the namespaces feature is false. In addition, 
most people don't want namespaces in HTML mode, so --html now 
implies --nons. To get the namespaces back, use 
--no-xml-declaration --method=html instead.

</p>

<ul>
	<li><code> upd:mergeUpdates</code></li>
	<li><code>     upd:revalidate</code></li>
	<li><code>     upd:applyUpdates</code></li>
	<li><code>     Update Primitives</code></li>
	<li><code>         upd:insertBefore</code></li>
	<li><code>         upd:insertAfter</code></li>
	<li><code>         upd:insertInto</code></li>
	<li><code>         upd:insertIntoAsLast</code></li>
	<li><code>         upd:insertAttributes</code></li>
	<li><code>         upd:delete</code></li>
	<li><code>         upd:replaceValue</code></li>
	<li><code>         upd:rename</code></li>
</ul>


<p>
According to spec editor Jonathan Robie:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The major changes in the XQuery Update Facility include a change to the grammar that eliminates superfluous and inconsistent use of curly braces, and a change to the compatibility matrix to eliminatehe incompatibility between primitive operations "insert into" and "insert into as last" when these operations are applied to the same target node.
</p>

<p>
The major changes in the XQuery Update Facility Use Cases include use of the new grammar and several new use cases, including updates on recursive structures, updates that create nilled elements, and an update that moves elements and attributes from one namespace to another.

The W3C XQuery working group has updated  
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-xmlquery-full-text-use-cases-20060501/">XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0 Full-Text Use Cases</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-xquery-full-text-20060501/">XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0 Full-Text</a>. Quoting from the latter:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
As XML becomes mainstream, users expect to be able to search their XML documents. This requires a standard way to do full-text search, as well as structured searches, against XML documents. A similar requirement for full-text search led ISO to define the SQL/MM-FT <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-xquery-full-text-20060501/#sqlmm">[SQL/MM]</a> standard. SQL/MM-FT <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-xquery-full-text-20060501/#sqlmm">[SQL/MM]</a> defines extensions to SQL to express full-text searches providing similar functionality as does this full-text language extension to XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0.</p>
<p>XML documents may contain highly-structured data (numbers, dates), unstructured data (untagged free-flowing text), and semi-structured data (text with embedded tags). Where a document contains unstructured or semi-structured data, it is important to be able to search using Information Retrieval techniques such as scoring and weighting.</p>
<p>Full-text search is different from substring search in many ways:</p>
<ol class="enumar">
<li>

<p>A full-text search searches for tokens and phrases rather than substrings. A substring search for news items that contain the string "lease" will return a news item that contains "Foobar Corporation releases the 20.9 version ...". A full-text search for the token "lease" will not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is an expectation that a full-text search will support language-based searches which substring search cannot. An example of a language-based search is "find me all the news items that contain a token with the same linguistic stem as "mouse" (finds "mouse" and "mice"). Another example based on token proximity is "find me all the news items that contain the tokens "XML" and "Query" allowing up to 3 intervening words.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Full-text search must address the vagaries and nuances of language. Search results are often of varying usefulness. When you search a web site for cameras that cost less than $100, this is an exact search. There is a set of cameras that matches this search, and a set that does not. Similarly, when you do a string search across news items for "mouse", there is only 1 expected result set. When you do a full-text search for all the news items that contain the token "mouse", you probably expect to find news
items containing the token "mice", and possibly "rodents", or possibly "computers". Not all results are equal. Some results are more "mousey" than others. Because full-text search may be inexact, we have the notion of score or relevance. We generally expect to see the most relevant results at the top of the results list.</p>
<p>As XQuery and XPath evolve, they may apply the notion of score to querying structured data. For example, when making travel plans or shopping for cameras, it is sometimes useful to get an ordered list of near matches in addition to exact matches. If XQuery and XPath define a generalized inexact match, we expect XQuery and XPath to utilize the scoring framework provided by XQuery and XPath Full-Text.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The following definitions apply to full-text search:</p>
<ol class="enumar">

<li>
<p>[<a title="Full-TextQueries" id="Full-TextQueriesDef" name="Full-TextQueriesDef">Definition</a>: <b>Full-text queries</b> are performed on tokens and phrases. Tokens and phrases are produced via tokenization.] Informally, tokenization breaks a character string into a sequence of words, units of punctuation, and spaces.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<a title="Token" id="TokenDef" name="TokenDef">Definition</a>: A <b>token</b> is defined as a character, n-gram, or sequence of characters returned by a tokenizer as a basic unit to be searched. Each instance of a token consists of one or more consecutive characters. Beyond that, tokens are implementation-defined.] Note that consecutive tokens need not be separated by either punctuation or space, and tokens may overlap. [<a title="Phrase" id="PhraseDef" name="PhraseDef">Definition</a>: A <b>phrase</b>

is an ordered sequence of any number of tokens. Beyond that, phrases are implementation-defined.]</p>
<div class="note">
<p class="prefix"><b>Note:</b></p>
<p>In some natural languages, tokens and words can be used interchangeably.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tokenization enables functions and operators that operate on a part or the root of the token (e.g., wildcards, stemming).</p>
<p>Tokenization enables functions and operators which work with the relative positions of tokens (e.g., proximity operators).</p>
<p>Tokenization also uniquely identifies sentences and paragraphs in which tokens appear. [<a title="Sentence" id="SentenceDef" name="SentenceDef">Definition</a>: A <b>sentence</b> is an ordered sequence of any number of tokens. Beyond that, sentences are implementation-defined. A tokenizer is not required to support sentences.] [<a title="Paragraph" id="ParagraphDef" name="ParagraphDef">Definition</a>: A <b>paragraph</b> is an ordered sequence of any number of tokens. Beyond that, paragraphs are
implementation-defined. A tokenizer is not required to support paragraphs.] Whatever a tokenizer for a particular language chooses to do, it must preserve the containment hierarchy: paragraphs contain sentences which contain tokens.</p>

<p>The tokenizer has to evaluate two equal strings in the same way, i.e., it should identify the same tokens. Everything else is implementation-defined.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This specification focuses on functionality that serves all languages. It also selectively includes functionalities useful within specific families of languages. For example, searching within sentences and paragraphs is useful to many western languages and to some non-western languages, so that functionality is incorporated into this specification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some XML elements represent semantic markup, e.g., &lt;title&gt;. Others represent formatting markup, e.g., &lt;b&gt; to indicate bold. Semantic markup serves well as token boundaries, while formatting markup sometimes does not. Implementations are free to provide implementation-defined ways to differentiate between the markup's effect on token boundaries during tokenization.</p></li>

The Apache WebServices Commons Project has released of <a href="http://ws.apache.org/commons/axiom/">AXIOM 1.0</a>. 
Near as I can tell this is yet another tree model like DOM, JDOM, or XOM.
However it's built from StAX rather than SAX.
Most importantly Axiom can build the
object tree on demand so you don't spend memory on nodes you don't want.
That sounds good, but it's been tried before (notably in Xerces's deferred DOM) and the results have not been impressive. Maybe these folks have figured out a more practical way to do this, though. The underlying push-pull parser distinction may be important for this.</p>


<p> 
Also of note is the support for XML Optimized Packaging (XOP) and MTOM. The Axiom announcement gets this exactly backwards though. 
XOP and MTOM do not allow "XML to carry binary data efficiently and in a transparent manner." Instead they allow both XML and binary data to be bundled together in the same non-XML file. Understanding the distinction is critical for proper use of these technologies. 
</p>

<p>
The Axiom API itself is too complex. For example, here's a chunk of code from the tutorial:
</p>

<pre>OMFactory factory = OMAbstractFactory.getOMFactory();
OMNamespace ns1 = factory.createOMNamespace("bar","x");
OMElement root = factory.createOMElement("root",ns1);
OMNamespace ns2 = root.declareNamespace("bar1","y");
OMElement elt1 = factory.createOMElement("foo",ns1);
OMElement elt2 = factory.createOMElement("yuck",ns2);
OMText txt1 = factory.createOMText(elt2,"blah");
elt2.addChild(txt1);
elt1.addChild(elt2);
root.addChild(elt1);</pre>

<p>And here's the equivalent in XOM for comparison:</p>

<pre>Element root =  new Element("x:root", "bar");
Element elt1 = new Element("x:foo", "bar");
Element elt2 = new Element("y:yuck", "bar1");
Text txt1 = new Text("blah");
elt2.appendChild(txt1);
elt1.appendChild(elt2);
root.appendChild(elt1);</pre>


<p>
Of course, XOM would 
notice that the requested elements use relative namespace URIs, and thus that the document containing them does not have a valid Infoset. For all the talk about Infosets on the Axiom pages, you'd hope somebody would have noticed this. Their examples also demonstrate a lack of correct white space handling, and some serious mistakes with encoding detection. 
I haven't tried to write code with this API yet, so I can't tell if the problems are in the library itself or just the tutorial. Either way, it's disturbing. 
</p>

<!-- <p>
The documentation is lacking. I'm guessing English is not the developers' native language. Folks, "performant" is not a word. 
When are open source projects going to realize they need to recruit some writers as well as programmers before shipping 1.0?
</p> -->

<p>
Folks: if you're going to write yet another XML API, please, please ask for early review from people who have been through this before. The reason the mistakes in Axiom jump out at me is that I've seen them all dozens of times before. XML is not as simple a spec as it seems at first glance. There are a lot of tricky areas that trip up the unwary. There are some interesting new ideas here, that should be explored further. However, as a library it's clearly unsuitable for production use.

Code Synthesis has released <a href="http://codesynthesis.com/products/xsd/">xsd 2.1.1</a>, an open source (GPL)
W3C XML Schema language based data binding tool for C++.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given an XML
       instance description (XML Schema), it generates C++ classes that
       represent the given vocabulary as well as parsing and serialization
       code (collectively called a mapping or binding).
    </p>

    <p>Compared to APIs such as DOM and SAX, the generated code allows
       you to access the information in XML instance documents using
       your domain vocabulary instead of generic elements, attributes,
       and text. Static typing helps catch errors at compile-time rather
       than at run-time. Automatic code generation frees you for more
       interesting tasks while minimizing the effort needed to adopt
       your applications to changes in the document structure.
    </p>


    <p><i>xsd</i> supports two C++ mappings: in-memory <i>C++/Tree</i>

       and event-driven <i>C++/Parser</i>. The C++/Tree mapping consists
       of C++ classes that represent data types defined in XML Schema, a
       set of parsing functions that convert XML instance documents to a
       tree-like in-memory data structure, and a set of serialization
       functions that convert the in-memory representation back to XML....
    </p>

    <p>The C++/Parser mapping provides parser templates for data types
       defined in XML Schema. Using these parser templates you can build
       your own in-memory representations or perform immediate processing
       of XML instance documents.

The XML Apache Project has posted version 0.92 of <a href="http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/0.92/">FOP</a>, an open source XSL Formatting Objects to PDF/PostScript/RTF 
converter written in Java. "This third release contains many bug fix release and new features compared to 0.91beta."
Java 1.3 or later is required.
</p>

<p>
FOP's improving, and it's good enough for simple protoyping and experimenting. However it's still not close to ready for most serious production needs. There are just too many missing pieces. The most important ones for my needs are automatic table layout, floating images, and whitespace preservation in code samples. Hopefully these will be improved in future releases in the push to 1.0.

Code Synthesis has released <a href="http://codesynthesis.com/products/xsd/">xsd 2.1.0</a>, an open source (GPL)
W3C XML Schema language based data binding tool for C++.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given an XML
       instance description (XML Schema), it generates C++ classes that
       represent the given vocabulary as well as parsing and serialization
       code (collectively called a mapping or binding).
    </p>

    <p>Compared to APIs such as DOM and SAX, the generated code allows
       you to access the information in XML instance documents using
       your domain vocabulary instead of generic elements, attributes,
       and text. Static typing helps catch errors at compile-time rather
       than at run-time. Automatic code generation frees you for more
       interesting tasks while minimizing the effort needed to adopt
       your applications to changes in the document structure.
    </p>


    <p><i>xsd</i> supports two C++ mappings: in-memory <i>C++/Tree</i>

       and event-driven <i>C++/Parser</i>. The C++/Tree mapping consists
       of C++ classes that represent data types defined in XML Schema, a
       set of parsing functions that convert XML instance documents to a
       tree-like in-memory data structure, and a set of serialization
       functions that convert the in-memory representation back to XML....
    </p>

    <p>The C++/Parser mapping provides parser templates for data types
       defined in XML Schema. Using these parser templates you can build
       your own in-memory representations or perform immediate processing
       of XML instance documents.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This release improves performance and adds
 automatic handling of forward inheritance  and a new enum mapping with support for inheritance has been implemented.

<blockquote><p>Web Services Description Language is defined in XML, because XML is the
standard format for exchange of structured information. The use of XML brings
better interoperability to WSDL generators and parsers, and the use of XML
Schema makes the structure of WSDL well constrained, yet extensible. On the
other hand, XML vocabularies in general don't have clear composition rules,
so combining for example the WSDL description of a Web service, the service's
policies and other information (presumably expressed in XML) can be done in
many significantly different ways (e.g. extending WSDL, extending the policy
language, creating a special XML container for all the information etc.), and
little interoperability can be expected when such combined documents are
used.</p>

<p>For example, a policy can be combined with WSDL by adding the policy
elements in WSDL service element. Equally, a WSDL description can be combined
with a policy by adding the WSDL description as part of the policy. While the
results should be similar (WSDL with policy information), they are in fact very different for the
processing software, and a policy in WSDL cannot easily be used by software
that doesn't know WSDL.</p>

<p>In contrast, the Semantic web requires knowledge from many different
sources to be easily combined so that unexpected data connections can be
used. For this purpose there is the Resource Description Framework (RDF),
whose graph structure together with the use of URIs for identifying nodes
makes it very easy for different documents to be brought together. If a WSDL
document describes a Web service, a policy document attaches
constraints to the service and a general description specifies the author of
the service, all this information can be merged and the resulting document
will contain all the three kinds of information associated with the single
service.</p>

<p>The main objective of this specification is to present a standard RDF ([<a href="#rdf">RDF</a>]) and OWL ([<a href="#owl">OWL</a>])
vocabulary equivalent to WSDL 2, so that WSDL 2 documents can be
transformed into RDF and merged with other Semantic Web data.</p></blockquote></dd>

 The W3C 
 RDF Data Access Working Group has published three candidate recommendations about SPARQL:</p>

<ul><li>
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/CR-rdf-sparql-XMLres-20060406/">SPARQL Query Results XML Format</a></li>
<li> <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/CR-rdf-sparql-protocol-20060406/">SPARQL Protocol for RDF</a></li>
<li> <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/CR-rdf-sparql-query-20060406/">SPARQL Query Language for RDF</a> </li>
</ul>

<p>
According to the introduction to SPARQL Query Language,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
An RDF graph is a set of triples; each triple consists of a <em>subject</em>,
  a <em>predicate</em> and an <em>object. </em>RDF graphs are defined in
  <a class="norm" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-rdf-concepts-20040210/">RDF Concepts and Abstract
  Syntax</a> <a href="#CONCEPTS">[CONCEPTS]</a>. These triples can come from a variety of
  sources. For instance, they may come directly from an RDF
  document; they may be inferred from other RDF triples; or they may be
  the RDF expression of data stored in other formats, such as XML or
  relational databases. The RDF graph may be virtual, in that it is not fully 
  materialized, only doing the work needed for each query to execute.</p>

  <p><acronym title="SPARQL Protocol And RDF Query Language">SPARQL</acronym> is a
  query language for getting information from such RDF graphs. It provides
  facilities to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>extract information in the form of URIs, blank nodes, plain and typed
    literals.</li>

    <li>extract RDF subgraphs.</li>

    <li>construct new RDF graphs based on information in the queried graphs.</li>

  </ul>

  <p>As a data access language, it is suitable for both local and
  remote use. The companion <a class="inform" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-protocol/">SPARQL Protocol for RDF</a> document
  [<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/CR-rdf-sparql-query-20060406/#SPROT">SPROT</a>] describes the remote access protocol.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
Here's a simple example SPARQL query adapted from the draft:
</p>

<pre>PREFIX  dc: &lt;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/>
PREFIX  : &lt;http://example.org/book/>
SELECT  ?var
WHERE   ( :book1  dc:title  ?var )</pre>

<p>
The <code>?</code> indicates a variable name. This query stores the 
title of a book in a 
variable named <code>var</code>. There are boolean and numeric operators as well. 
Strangely you can also use a dollar sign to represent a variable name. As far as I can tell this is exaclty the same as using a question mark. Why two forms? I don't know but I can guess. This really smells of a massive and pointless argument within the working group that was resolved by agreeing to do both when only one was necessary. 
</p>

<p>
Comments on all three CRs are due by June 6.

XimpleWare has released  
<a href="http://vtd-xml.sf.net">VTD-XML 1.5</a>, a free (GPL) 
<a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/05/19/parsing.html">non-extractive</a> Java library for  processing XML that supports XPath.
This appears to be an example of what Sam Wilmot calls "in situ parsing". In other words, rather than creating objects representing the content of an XML document, VTD-XML just passes pointers into the actual, real XML.
(These are the abstract pointers of your data structures textbook, not C-style addresses in memory. In this cases the pointers are int indexes into the file.) You don't
even need to hold the document in memory. It can remain on disk. 
This should improve speed and memory usage.
Current tree models typically require at least 3 times the size of the actual document, more often more. Using a model based on indexes into one big array might allow these to reduce their requirements to twice the size of the original document or even less. VTD-XML claims 1.3 times, but I haven't verified that.
</p>

<p>
However VTD-XML currently 
only supports the built-in entity references (&amp;quot; &amp;amp; &amp;apos; &amp;gt; &amp;lt;). They're some other limits. Element names are limited to 2048 characters. Documents can't be much bigger than a billion characters, so SAX (or XOM) is still needed for really huge documents. There's also a maximum depth to the document, though exactly what it is isn't specified. 
All this means VTD-XML is  not a conformant  XML parser. Given this,  comparisons to other parsers are unfair and misleading. I've seen many products that outperform real XML parsers by subsetting XML and cutting out the hard parts. It's often the last 10% that kills the performance. :-(
The other question I have for anything claiming these speed gains is whether it correctly implements well-formedness testing, including the internal DTD subset. Will VTD-XML correctly report all malformed documents as malformed? Has it been tested against the W3C XML conformance test suite? I'm not sure.

Traditionally word processors have been far too closely tied to their file formats, and this has led to less than robust products like Microsoft Word and WordPerfect.
Irrespective of the XML nature of the format, merely having a common document format 
that is not tied to any  one program is an important step forward.
Although OpenDocument started its life as the OpenOffice file format, there are now two major office suites with independent code bases that use it by default. That should shake out any unintentional couplings between OpenOffice and OpenDocument.

I noticed something today while exploring 
<a href="http://kiskis.sourceforge.net/">KisKis - Keep It Secret! Keep It Safe!</a>, a    free-as-in-speech (GPL) 
password manager written in Java. KisKis can export and import the passwords in XML using dom4j. The problem is MetaStuff publishes dom4j under an <a href="http://www.dom4j.org/license.html">unmodified BSD license</a>
that is <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/license-list.html#OriginalBSD">incompatible with the GPL</a> due to the advertising clause. 
Unless the dom4j folks are willing to change their license to remove the advertising clause, free-as-in-speech products should avoid it. XOM, DOM, and SAX, by contrast, are all GPL-compatible. I just spent a lot of time over the last few months <a href="http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JAXEN-132">getting the advertising clause removed from the Jaxen license</a>, so this is very much on my mind right now.

IBM's alphaWorks has updated the 
<a href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/xfg">XML Forms Generator</a>, a data-driven Eclipse plug-in that "generates forms that adhere to the XForms 1.0 standard, using as a starting point either Web Service Description Language (WSDL) documents or XML instance documents having optional XML Schema backing models. The generated forms adhere to the XHTML and XForms 1.0 standards and can be viewed in popular XHTML and XForms renderers." This release adds schematron support,
can  externalize text strings for localization, can place instance data inline, and runs with Java 5.
</p>


<p>
IBM has also released the <a href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/vxd">Visual XForms Designer</a>, an Eclipse plug-in for graphicaly editing XForms.
This product sits on top of the
Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF), Graphical Editing Framework (GEF), and Eclipse Web Tools Platform (WTP) which gives me very little hope that it will actually work. 
WTP in particular is  truly hideous, buggy piece of software, not up to the standards of rest of the Eclipse platform. I'm not sure whether that's because WTP is bad software or because it's built on top of the shaky foundations of GEF and EMF. (I suspect a little of both.)
</p>

<p>
Both the XML Forms Generator and the Visual Forms Designer are
 part of the Emerging Technologies Toolkit (ETTK), which is a nice way of saying they're closed source and more than likely 
IBM will eventually abandon them without ever making them available for
production use; either as closed or open source.

I've 
posted beta 9
of <a href="http://jaxen.org/releases.html">Jaxen 1.1</a>, an open source 
(modified BSD license) XPath 1.0 engine for Java that is adaptable to many different object models including XOM, JDOM, DOM, and dom4j. 
Jaxen was originally written by James Strachan and Bob McWhirter.
Beta 9 fixes an assortment of small issues. Most importantly it
cleans up the license which was a little contradictory and confused. (Not all pieces had the same license.) The entire package is now released under the modified BSD license (no advertising clause). 
</p>

<p>
Do not be fooled by the "beta" designation. 
This release has many fewer bugs and is <em>much</em> more 
conformant to the XPath specification than the official 1.0 release. We'll probably get around to calling it 1.1 final sometime later this year after closing a few more bugs and doing a little more work on performance. 
However, there's no reason to wait for that. If you're using Jaxen 1.0, you should upgrade to this beta.

IBM has updated the  <a href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/cxde">Compound XML Document Toolkit</a>, a closed source Eclipse plugin for editing XML documents that use multiple namespaces. 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The Compound XML Document Toolkit uses XML schemas to define the semantics of constructing documents spanning one or more namespaces.  Those semantics include the order and placement of elements, the allowable child elements, and available attributes for each element.
</p><p>
Sample XML schema profiles for these XML-based standards are provided with the Compound XML Document Toolkit; documents having mark-up of the following types may therefore be created and edited immediately upon installation:

</p><ul>
	<li>XHTML 1.1 + XForms 1.0</li>
	<li>XHTML 1.1 + SVG 1.1</li>
	<li>XHTML 1.1 + MathML 2.0</li>
	<li>XHTML 1.1 + XForms 1.0 + SVG 1.1</li>
	<li>SVG 1.1 + XHTML 1.1</li>
	<li>SVG 1.1 + XHTML 1.1 + XForms 1.0</li>

	<li>XHTML Mobile 1.1 + SVG Tiny 1.2</li>
	<li>SVG Tiny 1.2 + XHTML Mobile 1.1</li>
	<li>XHTML 1.1 + SVG 1.1 + MathML 2.0</li>
	<li>XHTML 1.1 + VoiceXML 2.0</li>
	<li>XHTML 1.1 + VoiceXML 2.0 + SVG 1.1</li>
	<li>XHTML 1.1 + SMIL 2.0</li>

</ul>
<p>
The Compound XML Document Toolkit also provides also provides tools for validating compound XML documents, in addition to one-step rendering of documents being edited.</p>

<p>
CXDE is based on the rather hideous Web Tools Platform though, so it's hard to recommend as a serious editor rather than a proof of concept. Conceptually, I'm very skeptical of the schema-based, strong typing ideal that drives this project. Personally I'm much more interested in products that treat schemas as suggestions rather than strait jackets. For instance, I don't mind an editor using a schema to suggest auto-complete options; but I don't want it to freak out if I add an <code>xi:include</code> element that isn't accounted for by the schema or paste in some invalid (but well-formed) legacy HTML.

The W3C Web API Working Group 
has published the first public working draft of 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-XMLHttpRequest-20060405/">The XMLHttpRequest Object</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The XMLHttpRequest object is an interface exposed by a
    scripting engine that allows scripts to perform HTTP client
    functionality, such as submitting form data or loading data
    from a remove Web site.</p>

    <p>The XMLHttpRequest object is implemented today, in some
    form, by many popular Web browsers. Unfortunately the
    implementations are not completely interoperable. The goal of
    this specification is to document a minimum set of
    interoperable features based on existing implementations,
    allowing Web developers to use these features without
    platform-specific code. In order to do this, only features that
    are already implemented are considered. In the case where there
    is a feature with no interoperable implementations, the authors
    have specified what they believe to be the most correct
    behavior.</p>

    <p>Future versions of this specification (as opposed to future
    drafts of this version) may add new features, after careful
    examination from browser developers and Web content
    developers.</p>

    <p>This specification was originally derived from the WHAT
    <acronym title="Working Group">WG</acronym>'s Web Applications
    1.0 document. The authors acknowledge the work of the WHAT
    <acronym title="Working Group">WG</acronym> in documenting
    existing behavior.</p>

Matthew Cruickshank has released <a href="http://holloway.co.nz/docvert/">Docvert</a>, some "web service software" that  "takes multiple word processor files (typically .doc) and converts them to Oasis OpenDocument.

Web Service receives .doc file and converts it to a Oasis OpenDocument 1.0 which can then be converted to HTML, RSS, or any XML format.

The resulting OpenDocument XML is then optionally converted to HTML or any XML. This is done with XML Pipelines, an approach that supports XSLT, breaking up content over headings or sections, and saving those results to multiple files (e.g., chapter1.html, chapter2.html…).  The result is returned in a .zip file.

Docvert is easy to integrate as it uses a simple REST-style interface, and it's released under the LGPL".

The W3C Technical Architecture Working Group (TAG) has published 
The Disposition of Names in an XML Namespace. This "document addresses the question of whether or not adding new names to a (published) namespace is a sound practice."
Short answer: it depends. Slightly longer answer:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Specifications that define namespaces <strong>SHOULD</strong> explicitly state their policy with respect to changes in the names defined in that namespace.</p>
<p>For namespaces that are not immutable, the specification <strong>SHOULD</strong> describe how names may be given definitions (or have them removed) and by whom.</p>

<p>If a namespace document is provided, as <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-namespaceState-20060329/#webarch">[WebArch Vol 1]</a> recommends, the namespace change policy <strong>SHOULD</strong> be stated in the namespace document.</p>
<p>As a general rule, resources on the web can and do change. In the absence of an explicit statement, one cannot infer that a namespace is immutable.</p>

<li>All attributes in the XLink namespace are now reserved for future versions of XLink.</li>

<li>Most importantly,
the <code>xlink:type="simple"</code> attribute is no longer required.</li>

That is a simple link can now be written like this:

It's no longer necessary to write this:

The W3C Web Services Addressing Working Group has  posted the proposed recommendations of 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/PR-ws-addr-core-20060321/">Web Services Addressing 1.0 Core</a> 
and 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/PR-ws-addr-soap-20060321">Web Services Addressing - SOAP Binding</a>.
As expected, the working group pretty much ignored all the comments that warned them they were driving the wrong way down the highway (and on the wrong side of the road)
and instead focused on the comments about which radio stations to play along the way to inevitable disaster.
I don't really care if WS crashes and burns. I just hope they don't run into anybody else's car driving the other way down the road when they do it. 
</p>

<p>
The core spec 
defines abstract generic extensions to the Infoset for 
endpoint references and message addressing properties.
The binding spec describes 
how the abstract properties defined in the core spec is implemented in SOAP.
The problem is that there already is an addressing system for the Web. It's called the URI, and web services addressing just adds complexity to that for no special benefit.
In fact, it's pretty clear that it doesn't do anything except add complexity.
</p>

<p>
Here's the problem. Web Services Addressing "defines two constructs, message addressing properties and endpoint references, that normalize the information typically provided by transport protocols and messaging systems in a way that is independent of any particular transport or messaging system." In other words this is another example of the excessive genericity problem, just like DOM; and we all  remember how well that worked. One of the fundamental  problems with DOM was that the W3C tried to develop an architecture that could work for all conceivable programming languages; but developers didn't want and didn't need an API for all programming languages. they wanted an API that was tailored to their own programming language. This is why language-specific libraries like XOM and Amara are so much easier to use and more productive than DOM.  
</p>

<p>
Web Services Addressing is trying to define an addressing scheme that can work over HTTP, SMTP, FTP, and any other protocol you can imagine. However, each of these protocols already have their own addressing systems. 
Developers working with these protocols don't want and don't need a different addressing system that's marginally more compatible with some protocol they're not using in exchange for substantially less compatibility with the protocol they are using. Besides nobody's actually doing web services over anything except HTTP anyway. Doesn't it just make more sense to use the well understood, already implemented debugged HTTP architecture for this instead of inventing something new?

 The W3C 
 RDF Data Access Working Group has published the last call working draft of 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-rdf-sparql-query-20060220/">SPARQL Query Language for RDF</a>.
According to the introduction,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
An RDF graph is a set of triples; each triple consists of a <em>subject</em>,
  a <em>predicate</em> and an <em>object</em>. This is defined in
   <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-rdf-concepts-20040210/#section-Datatypes-intro">

  RDF Concepts and Abstract syntax</a>. These triples can come from a variety of sources. For instance, they may come directly from an RDF document; they may be inferred from other RDF triples; or they may be the RDF expression of data stored in other formats, such as XML or relational databases. The RDF graph may be virtual, in that it is not fully materialized, only doing the work needed for each query to execute.</p>

  <p><acronym title="Simple Protocol And RDF Query Language">SPARQL</acronym> is a
  query language for getting information from such  RDF graphs. It provides
  facilities to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>extract information in the form of URIs, blank nodes, plain and typed literals.</li>

    <li>extract RDF subgraphs.</li>

    <li>construct new RDF graphs based on information in the queried graphs.</li>
</ul>


</blockquote>

<p>
Here's a simple example SPARQL query adapted from the draft:
</p>

<pre>PREFIX  dc: &lt;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/>
PREFIX  : &lt;http://example.org/book/>
SELECT  ?var
WHERE   ( :book1  dc:title  ?var )</pre>

<p>
The <code>?</code> indicates a variable name. This query stores the 
title of a book in a 
variable named <code>var</code>. There are boolean and numeric operators as well. 
Strangely you can also use a dollar sign to represent a variable name. As far as I can tell this is exaclty the same as using a question mark. Why two forms? I don't know but I can guess. This really smells of a massive and pointless argument within the working group that was resolved by agreeing to do both when only one was necessary.

Michael Kay has released version 8.7 of Saxon, his XSLT 2.0 and XQuery processor. This release is now available for .NET as well as Java. According to Kay,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The porting of Saxon to .NET was pioneered by M. David Peterson, Pieter Siegers Kort, and others, and the process has now been brought in-house within Saxonica. Saxon is written in Java, and the same source code is used for both products. The port is achieved by cross-compiling the Java code to MSIL using the IKVMC compiler developed by Jeroen Frijters, and using a combination of classes from the GNU ClassPath library and the .NET Framework library for run-time support.
</p>

<p>
Saxon 8.7 on .NET goes beyond previous Saxon.NET releases by providing greater integration with the .NET platform: in particular the System.Xml parser and utilities. It also provides a brand-new API designed to match the stylistic conventions of .NET and to provide a uniform approach to XSLT, XQuery, XPath, and XML Schema processing.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Saxon is published in two versions for both of which 
Java 1.4 or later (or .NET) is required.
<a href="http://saxon.sf.net/">Saxon 8.7B</a> is an open source product  
published under the Mozilla Public License 1.0 that 
"implements the 'basic' conformance level for XSLT 2.0 and XQuery."
Saxon <a href="http://www.saxonica.com/">8.7SA</a> is a 
£250.00 payware version that "allows stylesheets and queries to import an XML Schema, to validate input and output trees against a schema, and to select elements and attributes based on their schema-defined type. Saxon-SA also incorporates a free-standard XML Schema validator.
In addition Saxon-SA incorporates some advanced extensions not available in the Saxon-B product. These include a try/catch capability for catching dynamic errors, improved error diagnostics, support for higher-order functions, and additional facilities in XQuery including support for grouping, advanced regular expression analysis, and formatting of dates and numbers."

No, you didn't miss a step. They went straight from no-spec at all to proposed recommendation with no working drafts, no last call, no candidate recommendattions, no nothing. This is in pretty clear violation of every rule the W3C claims to operate by. The claim is that this is just an update of  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xhtml-modularization-20010410">Modularization of XHTML™</a> and  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-xhtml-m12n-schema-20031003">Modularization of XHTML™ in XML Schema</a>.

<p><code>&lt;Foo xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xhtml:id="f1" xhtml:onkeypress="some Javascript" xhtml:class="notHTML" /></code></p>

The W3C Scalable vector Grphic working group and 
Web API working group have posted the first public working drafts of 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/NOTE-rex-reqs-20060202/">Remote Events for XML (REX) 1.0 Requirements</a> and 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-rex-20060202">Remote Events for XML (REX) 1.0</a>. REX is "XML
      grammar intended for representing events as they are defined in
      DOM 3 Events, 
      primarily but not exclusively for purposes of transmission or synchronisation
      of remote documents. Such a vocabulary would enable one endpoint to interact 
      remotely with another endpoint holding a DOM representation by sending it DOM 
      Events as if they had occurred directly at the same location." That is, it is 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
 a transport agnostic XML syntax for the transmission of DOM events as specified in the DOM 3 Events
      specification [DOM3EV] in such a way as to be compatible with streaming protocols.
</p>


<p>
      The first version of this specification deliberately restricts itself to the transmission of mutation
      events so as to remain limited in scope and allow for progressive enhancements to implementations
      over time rather than require a large specification to be deployed at once. The framework
      specified here is however compatible with the transmission of any other event type, and
      great care has been taken to ensure its extensibility and evolvability.
</p>


</blockquote>

<p>
For example, this fragment might be used to insert a new item on this page:
</p>

<pre><code><![CDATA[<rex xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2006/rex' 
  xmlns:html='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
  <event target='//html:today' name='DOMNodeInserted' position='0'>

      <p>text here</p>
    </div>
  </event>
</rex>]]></code></pre>

<p>
It's not immediately clear to me who's supposed to be sending or receiving these events.

The W3C Voice Browser Activity has published the candidate recommedation of
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/CR-semantic-interpretation-20060111/">Semantic Interpretation for Speech Recognition (SISR) Version 1.0</a>.
According to the document,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This document defines the process of Semantic Interpretation for Speech
    Recognition and the syntax and semantics of semantic interpretation tags that can be
    added to speech recognition grammars to compute information to return to an
    application on the basis of rules and tokens that were matched by the speech
    recognizer. In particular, it defines the syntax and semantics of the contents of
    Tags in the Speech Recognition Grammar Specification [SRGS].</p>

    <p>The results of semantic interpretation describe the meaning of a natural language
    utterance. The current specification represents this information as an ECMAScript
    object, and defines a mechanism to serialize the result into XML. The W3C Multimodal
    Interaction Activity [MMI] is defining an XML data format [EMMA] for containing and annotating the information in user
    utterances. It is expected that the EMMA language will be able to integrate results
    generated by Semantic Interpretation for Speech Recognition.</p>

The W3C HTML Working Group has published the proposed recommendation of  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/PR-xhtml-print-20060131/">XHTML-Print</a>. According to the abstract, "XHTML-Print is member of the family of XHTML languages defined by the Modularization of XHTML [XHTMLMOD]. It is designed to be appropriate for printing from mobile devices to low-cost printers that might not have a full-page buffer and that generally print from top-to-bottom and left-to-right with the paper in a portrait orientation. XHTML-Print is also targeted at printing in environments where it is not feasible or desirable to install a printer-specific driver and where some variability in the formatting of the output is acceptable." In essence, this subsets XHTML with the features appropriate for printing. 
For instance, frames are not supported because "Frames depend on a screen interface and therefore are not applicable to printers." 
Comments are due by February 28.

The Mozilla Project has released  <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/seamonkey/">SeaMonkey 1.0</a>. 
This is the continuation of the integrated Mozilla suite, and has XML support roughly equivalent to Firefox 1.5 (e.g. XML, XSLT, CSS, XHTML, etc.)  There's something to be said for having the e-mail client, web editor, browser, and more rolled into one application. However, there's little to be said for maintaining the same ugly user interface of the old Mozilla builds. I didn't realize it until I switched back after surfing with Firefox for some months, and then tried switching back;
but there's more to Firefox than just a stripped down Mozilla.
I can't quite put my finger on it, but Firefox just looks prettier than Mozilla/SeaMonkey does. It sounds trivial; but if you try using both, I think you'll vastly prefer Firefox.

Code Synthesis has released <a href="http://codesynthesis.com/products/xsd/">xsd 1.8.0</a>, an open source (GPL)
W3C XML Schema language based data binding tool for C++.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given an XML
       instance description (XML Schema), it generates C++ classes that
       represent the given vocabulary as well as parsing and serialization
       code (collectively called a mapping or binding).
    </p>

    <p>Compared to APIs such as DOM and SAX, the generated code allows
       you to access the information in XML instance documents using
       your domain vocabulary instead of generic elements, attributes,
       and text. Static typing helps catch errors at compile-time rather
       than at run-time. Automatic code generation frees you for more
       interesting tasks while minimizing the effort needed to adopt
       your applications to changes in the document structure.
    </p>


    <p><i>xsd</i> supports two C++ mappings: in-memory <i>C++/Tree</i>

       and event-driven <i>C++/Parser</i>. The C++/Tree mapping consists
       of C++ classes that represent data types defined in XML Schema, a
       set of parsing functions that convert XML instance documents to a
       tree-like in-memory data structure, and a set of serialization
       functions that convert the in-memory representation back to XML....
    </p>

    <p>The C++/Parser mapping provides parser templates for data types
       defined in XML Schema. Using these parser templates you can build
       your own in-memory representations or perform immediate processing
       of XML instance documents.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This release expands support for various compilers and schema features including 
base64Binary and hexBinary.

The W3C has published the last call working draft of
Scope of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-mobile-bp-20060113/">Mobile Web Best Practices 1.0</a>. According to the draft,
</p>

<blockquote><p>
The recommendations in this document are intended to improve mobile experience
of the Web on mobile devices. While the recommendations are not
specifically addressed at the desktop browsing experience it must be understood
that they are made in the context of wishing to work towards 'One Web'.</p>

<p><a name="iddiv3102145456" id="iddiv3102145456">As discussed in </a><a href="#Scope">[Scope]</a> One Web means making, as far as is reasonable, the same
information and services available to users irrespective of the device they are
using. However it does not mean that exactly the same information is available
in exactly the same way across all devices. Some services and information are
more suitable for and targeted at particular user contexts.</p><p>Some services have a primarily mobile appeal (location based services, for
example). Some have a primarily mobile appeal but have a complementary desktop
aspect (perhaps for complex configuration tasks). Still others have a primarily
desktop appeal but a complementary mobile aspect (possibly for alerting).
Finally there will remain some Web applications which have a primarily desktop
appeal (lengthy reference material, rich images, perhaps).</p><p>It is likely that application designers and service providers will wish to
provide the best possible experience in the context in which their service has
the most appeal. However, while services may be most appropriately experienced
in one context or another, it is considered best practice to provide a
reasonable experience irrespective of the device, and as far as is possible, not
to exclude access from any particular class of device.</p><p>From the perspective of this document this means that services should be available
as some variant of HTML over HTTP.</p>

The W3C Compound Document Formats Working Group has published four
last call working drafts. 
"When combining separate markup languages, specific problems have to be resolved that are not addressed by their individual language specifications, such as the propagation of events across namespaces, the combination of rendering or the user interaction model.
Compound Document is the W3C term for a document that combines multiple formats." For example, a compound document might embed SVG and MathML in DocBook
or SMIL and XForms in XHTML.

The Apache Web Services Project has posted version 0.5.1 of <a href="http://ws.apache.org/jaxme/">JaxMe 2</a>,
an open source implementation of the Java API for XML Binding.
Quoting from the web page,
</p>


<blockquote>
<p>
        JaxMe 2 is an open source implementation of
        <a href="http://java.sun.com/xml/jaxb/"><span class="codefrag">JAXB</span></a>, the specification for
        Java/XML binding. 
      </p>

      <p>A Java/XML binding compiler takes as input a schema
        description (in most cases an XML schema but it may be a DTD, a
        RelaxNG schema, a Java class inspected via reflection or a database
        schema). The output is a set of Java classes:
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A Java bean class compatible with the schema description. (If the schema was
            obtained via Java reflection, then the original Java bean class.)</li>
          <li>An unmarshaller that converts a conforming XML document into the equivalent Java bean.</li>
          <li>Vice versa, a marshaller that converts the Java bean back into the original XML document.</li>
        </ul>
      <p>

        In the case of JaxMe, the generated classes may also
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Store the Java bean into a database. Preferrably an XML database like
            <a href="http://exist.sf.net/"><span class="codefrag">eXist</span></a>,
            <a href="http://xml.apache.org/xindice/"><span class="codefrag">Xindice</span></a>, or
            <a href="http://www.softwareag.com/tamino/"><span class="codefrag">Tamino</span></a>, but it may also
            be a relational database like <a href="http://www.mysql.com/"><span class="codefrag">MySQL</span></a>.
            (If the schema is sufficiently simple. :-)</li>
          <li>Query the database for bean instances.</li>

          <li>Implement an EJB entity or session bean with the same abilities.</li>
        </ul>
</blockquote>

According to Jochen Weidman, 0.5.1 "is a bug
fix release with no major changes, except that preliminary support for
external schema bindings has been added."

<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-mobile-bp-20051220/">Mobile Web Best Practices 1.0</a>.
 According to the abstract of Scope of Mobile Web Best Practices:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Web access from mobile devices suffers from problems that make
  the Web unattractive for most mobile users. W3C's Mobile Web
  Initiative (<a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/MWI/">MWI</a> )

</blockquote>
</div>

<p>
Most of the actual practices suggested make sense, though I take issue with a couple.
They are as follows: 
</p>

<ul><li>[CONTEXT] Take all reasonable steps to find out about the device/browser (client) capabilities, adaptation and other transformation that takes place for any instance of an access to a resource. (Informative)</li><li>[CAPABILITIES] Exploit device capabilities. Do not take a least common denominator approach. (Informative)</li><li>[DEFICIENCIES] Take reasonable steps to work around deficient implementations.  (Informative)</li><li>[TESTING] Carry out testing on actual devices as well as emulators.  (Informative)</li><li>[URIS] Keep the URIs of site entry points short. (informative) </li><li>[NAVBAR] Provide minimal navigation at the top of the page. (Informative)</li><li>[BALANCE] Design the service with a broadly balanced navigation tree where numbers of links on pages is balanced against depth of navigation. (Informative)</li><li>[THEMATIC_CONSISTENCY] Ensure that links provide a thematically coherent experience when accessed from a device other than the one on which they were captured. (Informative)</li><li>[NAVIGATION] Use navigation mechanisms in a consistent manner. (Informative)</li><li>[ACCESS_KEYS] Assign access keys to links in navigational menus and frequently accessed functionality. (Normative)</li><li>[LINK_TARGET_ID] Clearly identify the target of each link.  Use clear, concise, descriptive
link text to help users decide whether to follow a link.  Identify the
implications of following a link if the target is notably large and the
user might not anticipate this from the context. (Normative)</li><li>[LINK_TARGET_FORMAT] Note the target file's format unless you know the device supports it. (Normative)</li><li>[IMAGE_MAPS] Do not use image maps unless you know the target client supports them and has sufficient screen area and an appropriate means of selection, such as a stylus or navigation keys. When using image maps under these circumstances, use client side image maps unless the regions required cannot be described with an available geometric shape. (Normative) </li><li>[SERVER_SIDE_IMAGE_MAPS] Do not use a server side image map unless you know that the client provides a means of selection within the image map. (Normative)</li><li>[POP_UPS] Do not cause pop-ups or other windows to appear and do not change the current window without informing the user. (Normative)</li><li>[AUTO_REFRESH] Do not create periodically auto-refreshing pages, unless you have
informed the user and provided a means of stopping it. (Normative)</li><li>[REDIRECTION] Do not use markup to redirect pages automatically. Instead, configure the server to perform redirects by means of HTTP 3xx codes. (Normative)</li><li>[SUITABLE] Ensure that content is suitable for use in a mobile context. (Informative) </li><li>[CLARITY] Use the clearest and simplest language appropriate for a site's content. (Informative)</li><li>[LIMITED] Limit content to what the user has requested. (Informative)</li><li>[PAGE_SIZE_USABLE] Divide pages into usable but limited size portions.  (Normative)</li><li>[PAGE_SIZE_LIMIT] Ensure that the overall size of page is appropriate to bandwidth, the memory limitations of the device and other device and delivery channel characteristics if they can be determined. (Normative)</li><li>[SCROLLING] Limit scrolling to one direction, unless secondary scrolling cannot be avoided.  (Normative)</li><li>[SCROLLING_LIMIT] Limit secondary scrolling to objects that require it, where it cannot be avoided. (Normative)</li><li>[CENTRAL_MEANING] Ensure that material that is central to the meaning of the page precedes material that is not.  (Normative)</li><li>[GRAPHICS_FOR_SPACING] Do not use graphics for spacing.  (Normative)</li><li>[LARGE_GRAPHICS] Do not use large graphics.  (Normative)</li><li>[USE_OF_COLOR] Ensure that information conveyed with color is also available without color.  (Normative)</li><li>[COLOR_CONTRAST] Ensure that foreground and background color combinations provide sufficient contrast. (Normative)</li><li>[BACKGROUND_IMAGE_SUPPORT] Do not use background images unless you know the device supports them. (Normative)</li><li>[BACKGROUND_IMAGE_READABILITY] When using background images make sure that content remains readable on the device. (Normative)</li><li>[PAGE_TITLE] Provide a short but descriptive page title.  (Normative)</li><li>[NO_FRAMES] Do not use frames. (Normative)</li><li>[STRUCTURE] Ensure that perceivable structures within the content can be programmatically determined. (informative)</li><li>[TABLES_SUPPORT] Do not use tables unless the client is known to support them. Do not use multi-layer tables. (Normative)</li><li>[TABLES_LAYOUT] Do not use tables for layout. (Normative)</li><li>[TABLES_ALTERNATIVES] Where possible, use an alternative to tabular presentation. (Informative)</li><li>[NON-TEXT_ALTERNATIVES] Provide textual alternatives for non-text elements. (Normative)</li><li>[OBJECTS_OR_SCRIPT] Do not embed objects or script in pages unless you know the device supports them. (Normative)</li><li>[IMAGES_SPECIFY_SIZE] Always specify the size of images in markup. (Normative)</li><li>[IMAGES_RESIZING] Resize images at the server. (Normative)</li><li>[VALID_MARKUP] Create documents that validate to published formal grammars. (Normative)</li><li>[MEASURES] Do not use pixel measures and do not use absolute units in markup language attribute values and style sheet property values. (Normative)</li><li>[STYLE_SHEETS_USE] Use style sheets to control layout and presentation, unless the device is known not to support them. (Normative)</li><li>[STYLE_SHEETS_SUPPORT] Organize documents so that they may be read without style sheets.  (Normative)</li><li>[STYLE_SHEETS_SIZE] Keep style sheets as small as possible.

The W3C XML Key Management Working Group has published a note about
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/NOTE-xkms-pgp-20051219/">Using XKMS with PGP</a>.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The XML Key Management Specification (XKMS 2.0) [<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/NOTE-xkms-pgp-20051219/#XKMS">XKMS</a>] aims at providing a PKI independent interface
to key management. XKMS services comprise discovery and validation of
keys as well as support for certain aspects of the key life cycle
management, including registration, reissuance and revocation.</p>

<p>XKMS employs XML Signature [<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/NOTE-xkms-pgp-20051219/#XMLSIG">XMLSIG</a>] for the
purpose of providing message security in the form of authentication
and integrity. In addition, XKMS is based on the use of
the <code>&lt;ds:KeyInfo&gt;</code> element as a means of transporting key
information used as templates for the various operations it
specifies.</p>

<p>This technical note addresses some of the issues related to the use of XKMS in
conjunction with PGP</p>

I've been getting serious about Atom and RSS lately, and using it to enable some new cool features here and <a href="http://www.elharo.com/blog/">elsewhere</a>. You may have noticed the links on Cafe au Lait to the news items on my other sites, as well as the spiffy new <a href="today.atom">full text Atom feeds</a>. More is coming. I'm finding new uses of this technology everywhere I look.</p>


<p>
Yes, I know I'm a little late to the party, but I just couldn't stomach 
the <a href="http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/BottomFeeder/">crash prone</a>, <a href="http://sage.mozdev.org/">unreadable</a>, <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/">crippled</a>, <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/">privacy invading</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.org/">Web architecture violating</a>, <a href="http://backend.userland.com/rss092">brain damaged</a>, <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rss">catty</a>, and <a href="http://www.rssowl.org/">unusable</a>
software and specs that have been passed around in this space. However now that <a href="http://www.opencommunity.co.uk/vienna2.html">Vienna</a> has crossed my personal usability threshold for a feed reader and the Atom group has begun producing <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4287">XML-sane</a>, <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/atom/draft-ietf-atompub-protocol-07.html">HTTP-savvy</a> specifications that don't trigger my gag reflex, I'm finding these technologies 
to be ready for real work. 
</p>

<p>
To explore some of the issues,
over the next few weeks I'm going to be doing a mini-usergroup tour here in the Northeast. I'll be talking about how you can use RSS and Atom to manage, read, and publish all sorts of information. Hint: it's not just about weblogs.
 Dates and locations are as follows:
</p>


<ul>
	<li>Wednesday, January 11, <a href="http://www.lugip.org/">Linux Users Group in Princeton</a>: RSS, Atom, OPML, and All That</li>
	<li>Tuesday, January 17, <a href="http://xdncd.org/">Capital District XML Developers Network</a>, Albany, New York: XOM</li>
	<li>Tuesday, January 24, <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/PrincetonJUG/">Princeton Java Users Group</a>: RSS, Atom, OPML, and All That</li>
	<li>Monday, January 30, <a href="http://www.liphp.org/">Long Island PHP Users Group</a>: RSS, Atom, OPML, and All That</li>
	<li>Wednesday, February 8, <a href="http://www.cdjdn.com/">Capital District Java Developers Network</a>, Albany, New York: Measuring JUnit Code Coverage</li>
	<li>Tuesday, February 28, <a href="http://www.nyphp.org/">New York PHP Users Group</a>: RSS, Atom, OPML, and All That</li>
</ul>

<p>
OK. XOM and JUnit Code Coverage don't have that much to do with Atom; but I'll try to work something in; maybe an Atom example or two in the XOM talk. If you'd like me to reprise one of these talks for your group, <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;elharo%40metalab%2Eunc%2Eedu?Subject=User%20Group%20Invite">drop me an email</a>. 
Hope to see you at one or more of these!

The W3C CSS Working Group has published  a new  working draft of
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-css3-cascade-20051215">CSS3 module: Cascading and inheritance</a>."This CSS3 module describes how values are assigned to properties. CSS allows several style sheets to influence the rendering of a document, and the process of combining these style sheets is called “cascading”. If no value can be found through cascading, a value can be inherited from the parent element or the property's initial value is used....The main purpose of this module is to rewrite the relevant parts of CSS2
   as a module for CSS3. With the exception of the <code class="css">'initial'</code> value and the optional title for <code class="css"><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-css3-cascade-20051215/#import">'@import'</a></code> and <code class="css"><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-css3-cascade-20051215/#media">'@media'</a></code>, all features described in this module
   also exist in CSS2. Compared to CSS2, the cascading order has been changed
   in two cases as noted in the text."

The W3C CSS Working Group has published the third public working draft of
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-css3-multicol-20051215">Multi-column layout in CSS</a>.
This proposal defines three groups of
 new properties to support multi-column layouts in CSS3. 
  The first group sets the number and width of the columns:
  </p> 
<ul>
	<li><code>column-count </code></li>
	<li><code>column-width </code></li>
	<li><code>columns </code></li>
</ul>

<p>Properties in the second group specify 
the amount of space and rules between columns: </p>
<ul>
	<li><code>column-gap </code></li>
	<li><code>column-rule </code></li>
	<li><code>column-rule-color </code></li>
	<li><code>column-rule-style </code></li>
	<li><code>column-rule-width </code></li>
</ul>

          <p>The third group controls column breaks: </p>
<ul>
	<li><code>column-break-before </code></li>
	<li><code>column-break-after </code></li>
	<li><code>column-break-inside </code></li>

Happy New Year. I've got a little present for everyone today. I've often been asked for full text feeds, and I've <a href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/oldnews/news2005August4.html">responded</a> that this
would only happen "at such time as someone writes an RSS client that gives a user experience at least equal to a real Web browser." I also stipulated that said client
 had to be open source and run on my platform of choice. Privacy invasive server side solutions 
like Bloglines need not apply. 
</p>

<p>
Well about a month ago, that happened. Steve Palmer released <a href="http://www.opencommunity.co.uk/vienna2.html">Vienna 2</a>, the first open source, client based web browser for the Mac that passes the "It doesn't suck" test. There are still a few minor user interface glitches, mostly related to keyboard shortcuts and panel focus; but overall reading feeds in Vienna is equal 
or superior to reading them in a browser. And thus I am ready to announce something new:
</p>

<p>
Cafe con Leche is now publishing a <a href="today.atom">full text feed</a>.
This includes not only the complete text of today's news. It also includes the quote of the day, all recommended reading links, and all recent news. If you prefer to read  this site in a feed reader like Vienna go right ahead. You won't miss anything. 
</p>

<p>
The feed is  <a href="http://feedvalidator.org/check.cgi?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cafeconleche.org%2Ftoday.atom">valid Atom 1.0</a>. 
Every hour or so, cron fires up an
  XSLT 1.0 stylesheet that scrapes this web page and generates the feed. 
If you'd like something added to the feed, holler.
However, if your reader has trouble handling this feed, please file a bug with the reader vendor; or download a better reader like Vienna. I don't have the time or inclination to work around every bug in every
feed reader on the planet.
</p>

<p>
Now one word of warning: Just because I'm publishing full text feeds does not mean I'm giving up my copyrights, any more than publishing a web page does. No one but me has the right to take my articles and republish them on another site. 
You're welcome to read them in your personal reader, just like you can read them in a  web browser. I'm not going to get too worried if your personal reader is server based, like Bloglines. If you want to let
someone track every article you read and every click you make, that's your business.
But otherwise, republishing this content  
without prior permission is prohibited by U.S. and international law.
The RSS summary feeds will remain available
for any site that wants to aggregate the headlines from Cafe con Leche along with other sites. Full text, though, is available exclusively here.
<!-- If you'd like to republish something I've written, 
I am more than happy to license any of this content to you 
for a reasonable fee for on or offline use. Going forward,
anyone who republishes content from this site without permissio is going to get an invoice from me. If that invoice isn't paid, they're going to hear from a collection agency, and then they;re going to hear from my attorney. -->
