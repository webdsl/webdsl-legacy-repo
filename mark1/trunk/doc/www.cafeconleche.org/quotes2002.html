With something like default values, you can perform a normalization process and produce a self-contained document where defaults are explicit. The declaration of default values defines a mapping from an XML infoset to another instance of an XML infoset. It is not necessary to add complexity to applications to deal with default values. However, the W3C XML Schema PSVI is not like this; a PSVI is not an XML infoset. You cannot perform the PSVI infoset augmentation as a separate XML to XML transformation. All applications dealing with the PSVI are dealing with a different, more complex structure than applications that deal with pure XML. Applications communicating with the PSVI become much more tightly coupled: when applications communicate using the XML infoset, they do not have to share an address space, because there is a standard serialization of an XML infoset as XML, but this does not apply with the PSVI.  I believe this is a catastrophic architectural mistake in XML Schema, and it needn't have been like this: schema infoset augmentation could and should be defined as an XML to XML transformation process.	</blockquote><p>	--James Clark on the  www-tag mailing list,  Monday, 17 Jun 2002	</p>	</dd><dt id="quote2002December19">Thursday, December 19, 2002</dt><dd>		<blockquote cite="http://www.microsoft-watch.com/article2/1,4248,766199,00.asp"><p>C, C++, Java, etc. are very much tied to the concept of objects, components, functions, etc.XML and Web Services don't have these notions, so these existing languages, or the newer versions of the .Net languages need to evolve to capture the data manipulation aspects of XML and Web Services rather than the object/compiled aspects.</p></blockquote>	<p>--Ron Schmelzer, ZapThink <br />Read the rest in <a href="http://www.microsoft-watch.com/article2/1,4248,766199,00.asp">Microsoft 'X#' On Tap? </a></p>	</dd><dt id="quote2002December18">Wednesday, December 18, 2002</dt><dd>	<blockquote cite="http://www.microsoft-watch.com/article2/1,4248,766199,00.asp"><p>Languages need to evolve or die.

This does not mean that OO isobsolete. On the contrary, OO now has a much richer companion to offerricher mechanisms for sharing coarse-grained state information. There arecertainly situations where an OO solution is not called for. But that hasalways been the case, and OO systems still have a large role to play. Themisguided thinking that the XML structures a system shares with the rest ofthe world must match the internal data structures used for processing is oneof the things that leads naive developers to do things like try to use a 1GBXML document as a database. Encapsulation is still a good thing, butenlightened developers understand that in complex environments, differentobjects or systems may need to share coarse-grained data. The data that isshared is not simply the objects externalizing their internal data. Ratherthe shared data structures become part of the interface of the object, thecontract it abides by in interacting with other systems. It may look quitedifferent from what the objects use internally to support their processingneeds.</p><p>OO was never a panacea, even though it has been hyped as such by somedogmatists. Today we hear from some dogmatists hyping XML as the panacea toreplace OO. The truth is they are very nice complements to each other forany developer smart enough to avoid dogmatism and exercise common sense inchoosing appropriate solutions.</p>	</blockquote><p>	--Michael Brennan on the xml-dev mailing list,  Tuesday, 15 Jan 2002	</p>	</dd><dt id="quote2002December16">Monday, December 16, 2002</dt><dd>		<blockquote>	The "cruft" that people complain of in RDF/XML is only there for relatively complex situations.

Quick development cycles (typically aided by GUIs)and consistent results are key features here, and Flash can certainlyprovide those. XHTML+CSS+ECMAScript+XML+XSLT may not do that asconsistently, thanks to browser variations and GUIs that tend to obscureas much as they help. </p><p> In the longer term, ease of maintenance is a much more important setof issues. Can generations of different development teams reuse the codethey've been handed while writing in additional updates? How tightlybound are the data and the processes for working with that data? Can Icollect information from different sources or send it out to differentplaces? This was a Web application, but now we want to be able to accessit from cell phones, PDAs, and CB radios. </p><p>Those longer-term issues are a lot more difficult to address, and they typically require a combination of technology capabilities and best practices. Spaghetti DHTML isn't going to have any maintenance advantages over spaghetti Flash, but a setup that uses XML as a foundation for XSLT transformations into a variety of different target media, including XHTML+CSS+ECMAScript (and possibly different versions of that) may well have an advantage over the long term over an application that uses XML or SOAP to communicate with a monolithic client. </p></blockquote>	<p>--Simon St. Laurent <br />Read the rest in <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/editors/">oreilly.com  -  -  From the Editors List </a></p></dd><dt id="quote2002December12">Thursday, December 12, 2002</dt><dd>	<blockquote cite="http://news.com.com/1200-1120-975439.html?tag=vs3_toclink">One of the things about COM and CORBA is that you need both sides of the (transaction) handshake to understand each other.

The declaration of default values defines a mapping from an XML infoset to another instance of an XML infoset. It is not necessary to add complexity to applications to deal with default values. However, the W3C XML Schema PSVI is not like this; a PSVI is not an XML infoset. You cannot perform the PSVI infoset augmentation as a separate XML to XML transformation. All applications dealing with the PSVI are dealing with a different, more complex structure than applications that deal with pure XML. Applications communicating with the PSVI become much more tightly coupled: when applications communicate using the XML infoset, they do not have to share an address space, because there is a standard serialization of an XML infoset as XML, but this does not apply with the PSVI.

This data focus however is often cited as a fundamental weakness in these approaches, the separation of data from the functions that manipulate that data is often cited as the principle cause of complexity in non OO development. Objects, through exclusive ownership of their data, reduce complexity by leveraging abstraction and encapsulation to capture a more natural and maintainable model of their problem space.

Data has effectively broken free of its object boundaries. This however does not mean a return to data modeling techniques of the past but it does present new challenges to those accustomed to OO development. The natural tendency for some OO practitioners will be to place the XML inside objects, hide it somehow and try and get things back to the familiar world of objects where they have experience, tools, methodologies and comfort. This might make sense if XML was simply a better way to represent data. XML however is much more than just data, it is an extensive and expanding set of standards and technologies.
