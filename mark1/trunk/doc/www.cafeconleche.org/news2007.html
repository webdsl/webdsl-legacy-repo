Clever Age has released the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/odf-converter">OpenXML Translator 1.0</a>, a Microsoft Word 2007 plug-in that enables Word to read and write OpenOffice Open Document Format (ODF) documents.</p>

<blockquote>
 The converter is based on XSL transformations between two XML formats, along with some pre- and post-processing to manage the packaging (zip / unzip), schema incompatibility processings and the integration into Microsoft Word. We chose to use an Open Source development model that allows developers from all around the world to participate &amp;  contribute to the project.

Along with the Add-in for Microsoft Word, we also provide a command line translator that allows doing batch conversions. This translator could also be run on the server side for certain scenarios.

IBM's developerWorks has published 
<a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-pullparsingphp.html">Pull parsing XML in PHP</a>, an introductory tutorial about PHP5's new XMLReader class:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
PHP 5 introduced XMLReader, a new class for reading Extensible Markup Language (XML). Unlike SimpleXML or the Document Object Model (DOM), XMLReader operates in streaming mode. That is, it reads the document from start to finish. You can begin to work with the content at the beginning before you see the content at the end. This makes it very fast, very efficient, and very parsimonious with memory. The larger the documents you need to process, the more important this is.
</p>
	
<p>
Unlike the Simple API for XML (SAX), XMLReader is a pull parser rather than a push parser. This means that your program is in control. Rather than being told what the parser sees when the parser sees it, you tell the parser when to go fetch the next piece of the document. You request content rather than react to it. Another way of thinking about it: XMLReader is an implementation of the Iterator design pattern rather than the Observer design pattern.

Extreme Markup Languages 2007
 which takes place from  August 7-10, 2007 in 
Montréal. Extreme is a technical 
conference devoted to markup, markup 
languages, markup systems, markup applications, 
and software for manipulating and exploiting 
markup. According to B. Tommie Usdin, 
"Extreme is an open marketplace of theories about markup and all the
things that they support or that support them: the difficult cases in
publishing, linguistics, transformation, searching, indexing, and storage
and retrieval. At Extreme, markup enthusiasts gather each year to trade
in ideas, not to convince management to buy new stuff. At Extreme we push
the edges of markup theory &amp; practice."
Typical discussions topics include:</p>

<ul>	<li>Is tag soup poisonous?</li>
	<li>Will the Semantic Web ever 
take off? Does it matter?</li>	
<li>Is draconian error handling harmful?</li>
<li>Is overlap evil?</li>	
	<li>Is XML acidic or salty?</li> 
<li>Are grammars really the right way to validate documents?</li>

Code Synthesis has released <a href="http://codesynthesis.com/products/xsd/">xsd 2.3.1</a>, a free-as-in-speech (GPL)
W3C XML Schema language based data binding tool for C++.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given an XML
       instance description (XML Schema), it generates C++ classes that
       represent the given vocabulary as well as parsing and serialization
       code (collectively called a mapping or binding).
    </p>

    <p>Compared to APIs such as DOM and SAX, the generated code allows
       you to access the information in XML instance documents using
       your domain vocabulary instead of generic elements, attributes,
       and text. Static typing helps catch errors at compile-time rather
       than at run-time. Automatic code generation frees you for more
       interesting tasks while minimizing the effort needed to adopt
       your applications to changes in the document structure.
    </p>


    <p><i>xsd</i> supports two C++ mappings: in-memory <i>C++/Tree</i>

       and event-driven <i>C++/Parser</i>. The C++/Tree mapping consists
       of C++ classes that represent data types defined in XML Schema, a
       set of parsing functions that convert XML instance documents to a
       tree-like in-memory data structure, and a set of serialization
       functions that convert the in-memory representation back to XML....
    </p>

    <p>The C++/Parser mapping provides parser templates for data types
       defined in XML Schema. Using these parser templates you can build
       your own in-memory representations or perform immediate processing
       of XML instance documents.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This release enables you to customize
 parsing constructors and serialization operators. 
It also supports some more compilers.

The  W3C Web Application Formats Working Group has published a second last call 
working draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2007/WD-xbl-20070117/">XML Binding Language (XBL) 2.0</a>. 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
This specification defines the XML Binding Language and some supporting DOM interfaces and CSS features. XBL is a mechanism for overriding the standard presentation and interactive behavior of particular elements by attaching those elements to appropriate definitions, called bindings. Bindings can be attached to elements using either CSS, the DOM, or by declaring, in XBL, that elements matching a specific selector are implemented by a particular binding. The element that the binding is attached to, called the bound element, acquires the new behavior and presentation specified by the binding.
</p>

<p>
Bindings can contain event handlers that watch for events on the bound element, an implementation of new methods and properties that become accessible from the bound element, shadow content that is inserted underneath the bound element, and associated resources such as scoped style sheets and precached images, sounds, or videos.
</p>

<p>
XBL cannot be used to give a document new semantics. The meaning of a document is not changed by any bindings that are associated with it, only its presentation and interactive behavior.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
This version is a non-backwards-compatible "revision of Mozilla's XBL 1.0 language, originally developed at Netscape in 2000, and originally implemented in the Gecko rendering engine"  developed by Mozilla, Opera, Google, and Apple. 
(Hmm, who's missing from that list?)
It's supposedly less Mozilla focused, more browser independent.
This is not the same as  the W3C's sXBL effort, and it's not immediately clear whether work on that will continue in parallel, or if this will replace it in the W3C standards track. Either way this looks very interesting, and I hope the W3c can navigate the rocky shores of browser compatibility to get something usefully implemented.

XML editor written in Java. Oxygen supports XML, XSL, DTDs, XQuery, SVG, Relax NG, Schematron, and
the W3C XML Schema Language. According to the announcement, new features in 8.1 include:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The new &lt;oXygen/> NVDL (Namespace-based Validation Dispatching Language) editor allows you to visually edit NVDL scripts. A diagram showing the script structure and allowing navigation from a mode reference to its definition is available. When editing an NVDL script the content completion offers assistance for entering a mode reference by presenting the defined modes and for entering a new mode by presetting the modes used but not defined. Also the NVDL schema that drives the content completion was annotated, so you will get documentation for the proposals offered during editing.
</p>

<p>
A new XQuery Input View has been added. When editing an XQuery file, &lt;oXygen/> detects the documents used as inputs and presents a simplified outline for each one. The input view can analyse documents that are stored on the local file system. You can use the Drag and Drop triggered popup menu to easily create XQuery FLWOR constructs or XPath expressions.
</p>

<p>
You can copy and paste sections of tabular data between Microsoft Excel and the XML Grid Editor. This allow an easy import of tabular data into an XML structure and, respectively, an easy export of tabular data from an XML document to Excel.
</p>

<p>
Other new features include indexing support for Berkeley XML DB, custom format of calendar dates for import operations, update to Xerces-J parser 2.9.0 and support for SVN version 1.4.

IBM's developerWorks has published 
<a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-xformsfirefox/">	
XForms in Firefox</a>, an introductory tutorial about writing XForm:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
XForms makes development of Web-deployed applications faster and easier. XForms' clean architecture makes applications more robust, more scalable, faster, and more secure. Except for one little detail, developing with XForms would be a no-brainer. That detail is that no current browsers actually support XForms out of the box. Needless to say, this severely limits what you can do with XForms and where you can deploy them.
</p>

<p>
However, there are workarounds. Browser plug-ins exist for both Windows® Internet Explorer® and Firefox that add XForms support to these market-leading browsers. XForms processors have also been written in Flash that can be deployed to any browser with a Flash runtime. Finally, there are server-side solutions that precompile all XForms markup to classic Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and JavaScript programs.
</p>

<p>
These solutions all have something to recommend them, but for first learning XForms the simplicity of support right in the browser really helps. You can write a piece of a form and then preview it. Then you can change it a little bit more and preview it again. If the form doesn't look quite right, tweak it a bit and reload. Server-side solutions like Chiba are good for deployment, but for learning nothing beats the rapid development cycle of a browser. Therefore, in this article I focus on using the Mozilla XForms plug-in in Firefox.

The W3C XQuery and XSL working groups have  released 
XQuery 1.0, XSLT 2 and XPath 2 as a collection of eight related recommendations:

<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/REC-xquery-semantics-20070123/">XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0 Formal Semantics</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
Now the implementation work begins. There's one good open source implementation of XQuery/XSLT 2 (Saxon), a few native XML databases that support XQuery including the open source eXist, and one product I can't quite categorize (Data Direct XQuery). No browsers support XSLT 2 nor are any likely to in the near future.  Getting them to support XSLT 1 was a major struggle. 
</p>

<p>
Despite the hundreds of pages of specs, XQuery is still really only half done. 
Updates are still necessary and may become stable later this year. 
 Even when they're finished, I'm not sure if it will really be possible to write pure XQuery apps, or if you'll still need to use database specific code for crucial operations like defining collections. 
Standard 
Java and other APIs for talking to XQuery databases are also needed, and work is under way to produce them. Nonetheless this release is a major milestone. 
As Churchill once said,  "This is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning."

Rick Jelliffe has posted a beta <a href="http://www.schematron.com/implementation.html">implementation</a> of ISO Schematron. Schematron is an XPath based schema language that focuses on assertions rather than grammars. It is liberal (anything not forbidden is permitted) where other languages are conservative (everything not permitted is forbidden). According to Jelliffe, this release:
</p>
 
<blockquote>

<p>
is the successor to the "skeleton" XSLT meta-stylesheet implementation used widely for Schematron 1.5 and 1.6.  It implements all of ISO Schematron (http://www.schematron.com) except "abstract patterns", which will be folded in this month or added using a pre-processor.
</p>

<p>
Oliver Becker's skeleton design provides an XSLT API for the output templates. So it is very easy to override the default templates and make your own customized validator, if you are an experienced XSLT programmer. Existing validators built using the old skeleton API will probably work unchanged with the new one.
</p>

<p>
The site also contains two new (beta) validators built on the skeleton. Schematron SVRL generates XML output, using the Schematron Validation Report Language that is Annex D of ISO Schematron. Schematron Terminator will terminate after the first error is found. Example scripts are on the site to show how you can validate a document using SVRL output, then use a further "testing" Schematron schema to look at the validation results and report their significance or set error codes.
</p>

<p>
Comments and testers are very welcome.  The code is early beta (not recommended for republishing or commercial use:) and is being revised daily in response to feedback from the Schematron-love-in mail list<br />
   <a href="http://eccnet.eccnet.com/mailman/listinfo/schematron-love-in">http://eccnet.eccnet.com/mailman/listinfo/schematron-love-in</a>
</p>

<p>
It is open source, with a non-viral license.
</p>

<p>
I expect it will be tested enough for serious use by the beginning of February, but it will stay in beta status until:
</p>


<ul>
	<li> A small but full-coverage test suite has been created and passed</li>
	<li> The suite passes running over Saxon 8, Saxon 6, Xerces and MSXML engines</li>
	<li> The validator accepts the EXSLT and XSLT2 query bindings as well as XSLT1.</li>
	<li> Issues arising from user comments and feature requests are handled. (I have already gone back over about five years of feature requests and suggestions to improve the code.)</li>
	<li> Abstract patterns are implemented</li>

The W3C Device Independence Working Group has posted a  working draft of  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2007/WD-cselection-primer-20070109/">Content Selection Primer 1.0</a>. According to the draft,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p> there are capabilities in other W3C and IETF specifications that allow some level of control over the particular variant of a resource that is returned to a browser in response to a request. While these capabilities can support many of the use cases commonly found on the conventional Web, practical experience has found them somewhat lacking for supporting selection of material to be used to support the myriad of different kinds of device that are now able to access the Web.
</p>

<p>
We've already noted issues with existing mechanisms where two different devices both support the same media type, but have other requirements. For example consider images encoded using the Portable Network Graphics [PNG] specification being delivered to one device that is a tiny mobile phone, and another, which is a large, personal digital assistant with a large screen. Suppose that an author is required to provide different versions of a particular image in order to satisfy design criteria for a page that must be delivered to both devices. Different variants of the image are prepared to satisfy the criteria. However, because both devices support the same image encoding, PNG, content negotiation cannot be used to provide the appropriate version in this case. The criteria used in content negotiation are simply not sufficiently fine-grained to cater for even this simple level of selection.
</p>

<p>
Solutions that support a wide variety of different types of device require the ability to make use of a wider range of different alternative content variants, and employ a much richer set of criteria in connection with selection.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Here's an example from the primer:</p>
<pre>&lt;sel:select&gt;
       &lt;sel:when expr="eg:getStyleSheetSupport() = 'excellent'"&gt;
          &lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../styles/sensational.css"/&gt;
       &lt;/sel:when&gt;
       &lt;sel:when expr="eg:getStyleSheetSupport() = 'basic'"&gt;
          &lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../styles/mediocre.css"/&gt;

       &lt;/sel:when&gt;
   &lt;/sel:select&gt;</pre>

<p>
The basic idea is that markup inline in the document 
will indicate the device classes for which given content is appropriate. 
Such hints may be necessary and useful, but I'm still skeptical that it really has to be inline. I don't see why it couldn't be part of some kind of external style sheet, much as CSS rules can be attached through external style sheets. 
I still think this mixes markup and presentation.

FOP's improving, and it's good enough for simple protoyping and experimenting. However it's still not close to ready for most serious production needs. There are just too many missing pieces.

This release has a really serious conflict with FeedBurner, so you may want to wait for 2.0.7. I'm not sure whether it's Wordpress's fault or FeedBurner's. I've heard both groups blamed. However given Wordpress's known disregard for HTTP, I know where'd I'd put my money if I had to bet.

The W3C XForms working group has posted the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-xforms11-20061212/">fifth public working 
draft of XForms 1.1</a>. "XForms 1.1 refines the XML processing platform introduced by [XForms 1.0] by adding several new submission capabilities, action handlers, utility functions, user interface improvements, and helpful datatypes as well as a more powerful action processing facility, including conditional, iterated and background execution, the ability to manipulate data arbitrarily and to access event context information." Changes since 1.0 include:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>PUT and DELETE as forms actions </li>
	<li>HTTP headers can be controlled from the XForm submission.</li>
	<li><code>power</code>, <code>luhn</code>, <code>current</code>, <code>choose</code>, <code>id</code> and <code>property</code> XPath extension functions</li>
	<li>An email address datatype</li>
	<li>An ID card number datatype</li>
	<li>A <code>prompt</code> action element</li>
	<li>An xforms-close event</li>
	<li>An xforms-submit-serialize event</li>
	<li>Inline rendering of non-text media types</li>
</ul>


<p>The major change in this draft is the addition of a truly insane idea known as <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-xforms11-20061212/index-diff.html#structure-namespace">chameleon schemas</a>.
In brief, the namespace of an XForm is allowed to change depending on which document you put it in. This more or less makes namespaces completely pointless, and is based on two mistaken beliefs:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>The purpose of namespaces is merely to disambiguate the same names that appear in two different vocabularies.</li>

	<li>The intersection of the set of users smart enough to author XForms and the set of users too stupid to understand namespace scoping rules is non-empty.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I've argued against this change, but the working group  seems hell-bent on defenestrating namespaces. This is going to make 
writing generic XForms processors and  libraries much harder.
