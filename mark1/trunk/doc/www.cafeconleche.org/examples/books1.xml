          This is the best book I know about basic algorithms 
          and data structures. 
          I refer to it frequently.

        A fascinating look at why C++ is what it is, for better or worse, by the man 
        who invented it. Even though Java is never mentioned, 
         this book should convince convince 
        you that C++ and Java really are two very 
         different languages.
