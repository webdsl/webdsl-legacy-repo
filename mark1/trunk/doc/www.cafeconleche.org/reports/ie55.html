<h2><a name="initial">Initial Report, Wednesday  July 12, 2000</a></h2>	

<p>
Microsoft's released <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/download/ie55.htm">Internet Explorer 
5.5 for Windows</a>.
This release includes a lot of XML support.
CSS support is expanded. A print preview function has been added. 
I don't yet know whether or not this supports real XSLT as opposed to 
the pseudo-XSLT
IE5 used. 
More news as I try it out.  
</p>

<p>
OK, I've installed it and ran some simple test files at it and I am sad to report that
<strong>IE 5.5 failed almost all my tests quickly, obviously, and immediately. </strong>
It does a worse job on XML pages with XSLT stylesheets
than the latest beta of MSXML3 that I had running with IE5.
Many other known bugs and annoyances
have yet to be fixed. In particular:
</p>


<ul>
<p>
<li>The open file dialog still doesn't let you select XML files. To open an XML file
you have to select All Files. </li>
</p>
<p>
<li>Some long-standing bugs in handling of entity declarations in DTDs remain.
This means IE5.5 is still unable to parse the 
<a href="http://www.w3c.org/TR/REC-xml">XML 1.0 specification</a> and many
of Jon Bosak's marked up Shakespeare plays, 
<a href="http://metalab.unc.edu/xml/examples/shakespeare/all_well.xml"><cite>All's Well that Ends 
Well</cite></a>, for just one example.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
While IE5.5 finally recognizes the
correct namespace URI for XSLT, it does not recognize the correct MIME type (text/xml, not text/xsl). 
Furthermore, it has some major problems with XSLT 1.0 stylesheets.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I cut Microsoft a lot of slack for IE5, probably more than I should have.
 What they provided in IE5 was a reasonable implementation of what was then the current draft
 specification. However, the XSLT 1.0 spec preceded IE5.5 by more than half a year, and 
 Microsoft still hasn't gotten it right! At this point,  I can only attribute their failure 
 to
 incompetence or malice. Take your pick.
