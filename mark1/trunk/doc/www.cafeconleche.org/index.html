Microsoft uses VML, which is poorly documented, poorly implemented, has strong dependencies on Microsoft libraries and has been "frozen" since the mid-1990s. When Adobe's SVG plugin support expires in 2008, how many people who are depending upon SVG for their applications (such as the city of Toronto, not a small customer by any means) will just decide to refactor their applications to work on Mozilla and jettison their reliance on IE. When XForms support becomes integrated into Mozilla as part of the core suite (mid-summer 2007) how many customers of Infopath will start to see this as a commercially viable alternative? Or when Opera and Safari follow suit? How many web developers will just say "to hell with it" because IE's JavaScript support (excuse me, JScript support) doesn't even bother to support getters or setters, and the costs of maintaining two code bases gets to be too onerous. No, the lagging users are still firmly in the MIcrosoft camp, but the leading edge has been dropping IE in favor of alternatives at a far higher rate than the ones that are going the other way.</div></blockquote><p>--Kurt Cagleon the xml-dev mailing list, Saturday, 20 Jan 2007 16:28:26 </p></quoteoftheday><h2 style="color: #AA0000" id="today">Today's News</h2><today date="Monday, February 19, 2007" id="news2007February19"><div id='February_19_2007_33160' class='2007-02-19T09:13:40Z'><p>The W3C HTML Working Group has posted a new working draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2007/WD-xml-events-20070216">XMLEvents 2</a>.

According to the draft,</p><blockquote><p>A plethora of applications and data are exposed as XML over HTTP. User agents such as Voice and Web browsers fetch and execute applications but restrict the XML content accessible to those applications merely to the URLs located in the same domain as the application. To take advantage of the rich XML content available on the Web, application developers must resort to proxying the content through the domain hosting their application thereby increasing overhead and limiting scalability.</p><p>This note describes a mechanism being used in the industry that allows a content provider to use a processing instruction embedded within the XML prolog to specify the access policy of that content. In this model a user agent can safely extend the sandbox in which it has restricted the application to include access to the XML content if and only if the specified policy grants permission.</p><p>The processing instruction is designed explicitly to enable extending the sandbox and is not designed as a restriction mechanism. The expectation is that the user agent's default policy is more strict. Therefore, it is always safe to fall-back to default policy in the event of an error.</p><p>ISSUE: The Task Force would like to enable this mechanism as an HTTP header (e.g. Content-Access-Control).

According to the draft,</p><blockquote><p>Semantic Annotations for WSDL and XML Schema (SAWSDL) defines how to add semantic annotations to various parts of a WSDL document such as input and output message structures, interfaces and operations. The extension attributes defined in this specification fit within the WSDL 2.0 extensibility framework. For example, it defines a way to annotate WSDL interfaces and operations with categorization information that can be used to publish a Web service in a registry. The annotations on schema types can be used during Web service discovery and composition. In addition, SAWSDL defines an annotation mechanism for specifying the structural mapping of XML Schema types to and from an ontology such mappings could be used during invocation, particularly when mediation is required. To accomplish semantic annotation, SAWSDL defines extension attributes that can be applied both to WSDL elements and to XML Schema elements.</p><p>Semantic annotations are references from an element within a WSDL or XML Schema document to a concept in an ontology or to a mapping. This specification defines annotation mechanisms for relating the constituent structures of WSDL input and output messages to concepts defined in an outside ontology. Similarly, it defines how to annotate WSDL operations and interfaces. Further, it defines an annotation mechanism for specifying the structural mapping of XML Schema types to and from an ontology by means of a reference to a mapping definition. The annotation mechanism is independent of the ontology expression language and this specification requires no particular ontology language. It is also independent of mapping languages and does not restrict the possible choices of such languages.</p></blockquote></div></dd><dt id="news2007February14">Wednesday, February 14, 2007 (<a href="oldnews/news2007February14.html">Permalink</a>)</dt><dd><div id='February_14_2007_36991' class='2007-02-14T10:17:31Z'><p>The W3C CSS Working Group has posted a new working draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2007/WD-css3-gcpm-20070205/">CSS3 module: Generated Content for Paged Media</a> that "describes how CSS style sheets can express named strings, leaders, cross-references, footnotes, endnotes, running headers and footers, named flows, new counter styles, page and column floats, hyphenation, bookmarks, change bars, continuation markers, named page lists, and generated lists."</p></div><hr class='empty'/><div id='February_14_2007_36421' class='2007-02-14T10:07:01Z'><p>The W3C CSS Working Group has resurrected <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2007/WD-becss-20070205/">Behavioral Extensions to CSS</a>."Behavioral Extensions provide a way to link to binding technologies, such as XBL, from CSS style sheets.
