Microsoft uses VML, which is poorly documented, poorly implemented, has strong dependencies on Microsoft libraries and has been "frozen" since the mid-1990s. When Adobe's SVG plugin support expires in 2008, how many people who are depending upon SVG for their applications (such as the city of Toronto, not a small customer by any means) will just decide to refactor their applications to work on Mozilla and jettison their reliance on IE. When XForms support becomes integrated into Mozilla as part of the core suite (mid-summer 2007) how many customers of Infopath will start to see this as a commercially viable alternative? Or when Opera and Safari follow suit? How many web developers will just say "to hell with it" because IE's JavaScript support (excuse me, JScript support) doesn't even bother to support getters or setters, and the costs of maintaining two code bases gets to be too onerous. No, the lagging users are still firmly in the MIcrosoft camp, but the leading edge has been dropping IE in favor of alternatives at a far higher rate than the ones that are going the other way.</div></blockquote><p>--Kurt Cagleon the xml-dev mailing list, Saturday, 20 Jan 2007 16:28:26 </p></dd><dt id="quote2007February17">Saturday, February 17, 2007</dt><dd><blockquote><div>Since I am (among other things) a PHP developer I know all there is to know about sloppy coding...  ;-) </div></blockquote><p>--Keryx Web on the whatwg mailing list, Saturday, 17 Feb 2007 18:31:27 </p></dd><dt id="quote2007February16">Friday, February 16, 2007</dt><dd><blockquote cite="http://www.securityfocus.com/columnists/334/2"><div>I believe we're making zero progress in computer security, and have been making zero progress for quite some time.

It's 2005, and IT managers still don't seem to know how to build networks that don't collapse when a worm gets loose on them. Security thinkers realized back in the early 80's that networks were a good medium for attack propagation and that networks would need to be broken into separate security domains with gateways between them. None of this is rocket science - I think that what we're seeing today is the results of this massive exuberance in the late 1990's in which everyone rushed to put all their mission critical assets onto these poorly protected networks that they then hooked to the Internet.

Imagine a world where every online store sells DRM-free music encoded in open licensable formats. In such a world, any player can play music purchased from any store, and any store can sell music which is playable on all players. This is clearly the best alternative for consumers, and Apple would embrace it in a heartbeat. If the big four music companies would license Apple their music without the requirement that it be protected with a DRM, we would switch to selling only DRM-free music on our iTunes store. Every iPod ever made will play this DRM-free music.</p><p>Why would the big four music companies agree to let Apple and others distribute their music without using DRM systems to protect it? The simplest answer is because DRMs haven’t worked, and may never work, to halt music piracy. Though the big four music companies require that all their music sold online be protected with DRMs, these same music companies continue to sell billions of CDs a year which contain completely unprotected music. That’s right! No DRM system was ever developed for the CD, so all the music distributed on CDs can be easily uploaded to the Internet, then (illegally) downloaded and played on any computer or player.</p><p>In 2006, under 2 billion DRM-protected songs were sold worldwide by online stores, while over 20 billion songs were sold completely DRM-free  and unprotected on CDs by the music companies themselves. The music companies sell the vast majority of their music DRM-free, and show no signs of changing this behavior, since the overwhelming majority of their revenues depend on selling CDs which must play in CD players that support no DRM system.</p><p>So if the music companies are selling over 90 percent of their music DRM-free, what benefits do they get from selling the remaining small percentage of their music encumbered with a DRM system? There appear to be none. If anything, the technical expertise and overhead required to create, operate and update a DRM system has limited the number of participants selling DRM protected music. If such requirements were removed, the music industry might experience an influx of new companies willing to invest in innovative new stores and players. This can only be seen as a positive by the music companies.</p></div></blockquote><p>--Steve Jobs <br class="empty"/>Read the rest in <a href="http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughtsonmusic/">Apple </a></p></dd><dt id="quote2007February6">Tuesday, February 6, 2007</dt><dd><blockquote cite="http://www.informationweek.com/news/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=197003052"><div><p>We seem to have sunk to a kind of playground system of forming contracts.

So all pretty straightforward. Parsing <abbr>HTML</abbr> is different. You still have an <code>inputstream</code>. You still have a <code>tokenizer</code> stage, but it’s more complicated. It has to deal with error handling, but also with input from the <code>parser</code> stage as some states within <code>tokenizer</code> do different things depending on which token has just been emitted. For instance, after you have encountered a <code>script</code> element start tag you have to consume characters and append them to the element until you see a <code>script</code> element closing tag (basically some lookahead handling after <code>&lt;/</code>). You also can’t simply tell a <code>treebuilder</code> that a start tag has been seen. Sometimes you need to insert elements directly before the last opened <code>table</code> element for instance (simply said).

Perhaps developers took this philosophy a little too far. The entire operating system now seems to have turned against the user.

So called “tilt bits” will signal an attack on the system if anything is found out of the ordinary.
