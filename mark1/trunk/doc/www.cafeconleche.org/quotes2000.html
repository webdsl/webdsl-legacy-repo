	<blockquote>
	Most of the unfulfilling argument surrounding it springs from the
assumption that, since namespace names *look* like URLs, they should *act*
like URLs -- that is, that one should be able to to point a Web Browser
at them and retrieve something useful since they look like something one
might point a Web Browser at.  This assumption, while not unreasonable,
is explicitly disclaimed by the namespaces spec.  Namespace names are
Identifiers, not Locators.

	I propose instead we have a Millennial Namespaces Treaty of Wulai (named
after the hot springs where I have been soaking today, looking out at a
waterfall on the pretty green opposing valley, feeling like a boiling egg
with no timer), where we all agree that in some limited but important
circumstances (namespace URI=schema URI) makes sense, and should be allowed,
even though the general case should not support (namespace URI=schema URI),
though in no case does (namespace=schema).  Then the discussion would be on
how to cope with this diversity both hygenically and respectfully.

	I don't really see any reason that anyone would use XHTML 
modularization; XHTML is already "extensible" in the sense that
anything in XML is -- why the need for another extensibility
scheme added onto that?  My prediction is that modularization will
seem quite useful at first, until developers realize that it does
very little for them, and it will soon be a discarded technology
full of promise but of little actual use.

Separating document structure from it's presentation may not make any

    I have no faith in Semantic Web plans -- they sound too much like the
Information-Highway plans that *lost* to the Internet and Web a decade
ago.  I see a role for RDF or something similar on the Web for pure
data, like (say) mutual fund values or GIS information -- stuff that
users plan on processing automatically by machine (and that you would
use delimited text or a spreadsheet file for right now).  In this view
RDF would simply be the data counterpart of HTML rather than a silver
bullet that will enable intelligent searching and machine
understanding.

    I'm very happy with a lot of the work I see in Topic Maps, RDF, schemas,
and other information modeling systems.  I'm deeply unhappy, however, with
the strange visions of a Grand Unified Information Model (GUIM) they seem
to produce in some people.  I'd like to take something of an Extreme
Programming view on this project, evolving vocabularies and architectures
from pieces which we can make work today without nearly as much concern for
the larger vision set forth in the various requirements of the GUIM.  I
don't think it will lead us directly to the GUIM, but it might let us get
more work done in the meantime.

not as a problem.  There's more going on than just nailed-down semantics

    The more tools you have an understanding of, the better you will be
    at resolving any problem placed before you.  XML, Java, C, even
    Fortran have their appropriate uses.  It should be our goal as
    developers to know when to use which tool.  If you only learn XML
    and Java, you will always try to use them, even when a simple script
    would be the better solution.  Not everything needs to be
    cross-platform, web accessible, and scalable.  Know the requirements
    and choose the appropriate tool to solve the problem.

    <blockquote>
    the right of anonymity, which people are beginning to
    see they might have some stake in, and what we now call privacy, by
    which this time we mean control over personal information, both
    depend upon encryption based solutions. If we are going to have the
    ability to read what we want without being surveilled in reading it,
    that's because we are using agents to do our reading, which are
    unidentifiable and which restore content to us in an encrypted
    stream. That's how we get around people who establish surveillance
    blockages or interception points to find out what we're reading and
    whether we're paying for it, doing something seditious because of
    it, or just looking at naked people, or whatever. Our ability to
    behave anonymously on the net, and our ability to control the flow
    of information about ourselves both depend on our ability to encrypt
    what we do.

According to Mark Tilden's calculations,
                    building a traditional robot typically takes
                    about eighteen months of manpower and
                    programming. BEAM robots can be built in
                    considerably less time. Somehow this does not
                    reassure me. The instruction manual is filled
                    with blurry pictures and daunting
                    explanations. ("When the voltage level
                    matches a preset point at the 1381, it sends a
                    pulse out to the 2N3904 transistor, turning it
                    on, then some power splits off through the
                    2.2.k resistor and goes into the 2N3906
                    transistor.") Hmm�

What we have here are two different structures of the
                                distribution of cultural product. You have a set of people whose
                                fundamental belief is that cultural products are best distributed
                                when they are owned, and they are attempting to construct a leak
                                proof pipe from production studio to eardrum or eyeball of the
                                consumer. Their goal is to construct a piping system that allows
                                them to distribute completely dephysicalized cultural entities which
                                have zero marginal cost and which in a competitive economy would
                                therefore be priced at zero, but they wish to distribute them at
                                non-zero prices. In the ideal world, they would distribute them at
                                the same prices they get for physical objects which cost a lot of
                                money to make, move and sell, and they would become ferociously
                                profitable. They are prepared to give on price, but at every turn, as
                                with the VCR at the beginning of the last epoch, their principle is
                                any ability of this content to escape their control will bring about the
                                end of civilization.

We're about to reach the end of what might be known as the golden age of personal computer software. Like the
automobiles of the 1950's, the software of the 1990's delighted and amused us despite its many flaws and
shortcomings. In the 1950's what was good for the car industry was good for the US? an argument that in ways
has applied to the software and "dot com" industries in the 1990's. As with car quality in the 1950's, it is widely
argued that it is a disservice to stockholders to make software more reliable than the market has demanded.
Instead of solid engineering values, fancy features and horsepower are the two factors used to sell computing
systems. While this euphoric era of desktop computing will be remembered fondly by many, its days are
numbered.
</p>

<p>
The current era of desktop computing will pass soon, just as it did for automobiles when the combination of oil
shortages and Japanese manufacturing prowess threw Detroit from the leading force in the economy into part of
the rust belt. It will only be possible to pin down the triggering factors for demise of the current "golden era" of
computer software in retrospect. But, it seems likely that the shift to a new era will involve factors such as the
globalization of the software business, the adoption of desktop computers as an essential business tool rather
than an occasional productivity enhancer, and the continuing proliferation of computers into embedded systems
that form the new infrastructure of our society. The issue of what is eventually said to cause the transition to
this new era of computing systems is, however, not as important as the fact that it is inevitable in our changing
world.

<p>
A central theme of the new era of computing will be an absolute requirement for high dependability (but,
without the traditionally exorbitant price tag usually associated with critical systems). Public computing fiascoes
such as probes crashing into Mars or on-line services of all sorts going belly up for a hours at a time are only the
tip of the iceberg of this need. Every one of us personally experiences computing system meltdowns on a regular
basis, and it would be no surprise if our children develop a quick reflex for pressing control-alt-delete before
they've memorized their multiplication tables. While stories of bad software killing people are still rare, they exist
and may portend the future. The lessons of the Y2K experience are twofold: such problems can indeed be
overcome by dint of extraordinary effort and expenditures, but just as importantly, we rely upon computers far
more than we fully realize until we're forced to step back and take notice of the true situation.
</p>

<p>
The point is that enthusiasm for computers has progressed to the point that our society is already completely
committed to using them, and is becoming utterly dependent on them working correctly and continuously. But,
commercial computer systems, as we currently build them, simply aren't worthy of our unreserved trust and
confidence.

What is changing is that higher-level languages are becoming much more important
                           as the number of computer-involved people increases. Things that began as neat but
                           small tools, like Perl or Python, say, are suddenly more central in the whole scheme of
                           things. The kind of programming that C provides will probably remain similar
                           absolutely or slowly decline in usage, but relatively, JavaScript or its variants, or XML,
                           will continue to become more central. For that matter, it may be that Visual Basic is
                           the most heavily used language around the world. I'm not picking a winner here, but
                           higher-level ways of instructing machines will continue to occupy more of the center

the fact that in that space, you can't do anything no matter
how trivial without access to the DTD.  But lots of smart people

corruption of HTML by people who don't want to learn anything more
than how to make their pages *look pretty* in their browser; we
finally have the chance to migrate from a hideous morass to a logical
foundation; we finally have the chance to do search engine and
knowledge management *right*; we finally have the chance to use markup
the way it was meant to be used: as a structurally oriented means of
applying semantics to otherwise meaningless content and leave
presentation to the receiver. XHTML becomes the vehicle for the
introduction of sanity into an insane world, by making up for the
mistakes of the past eight years through reintroducing the concepts of

<p>Netscape has been heavily <a
href="http://www.oreilly.com/news/flanagan_1100.html">criticized</a> for
its deficiencies. These criticisms do seem a little onesided however,
given that the release of Netscape 6 is overwhelmingly <em>good</em>
news for web developers, since support for things like the DOM mean that
DHTML will no longer have to be rewritten with each new browser release
(in fact many people have criticised Mozilla for this - saying that
because it doesn't support the document.all object, which is just as
proprietary as Netscape 4's layers, it therefore does not support
'DHTML').

<p>Given that Netscape's focus on standards has been unprecedented,
these criticisms are unbalanced, if not entirely unjustified (obviously
<em>any</em> standards support problem is undesirable). In particular,
it is easy to take an open bug database and pick some bugs and say that
for those bugs the product should not be released - the openness of
Mozilla does not help it from a PR point of view - when in fact every
browser, every product ships with bugs - it's just that when (for
example) previous buggy versions of Netscape shipped, there was not an
open database from which to search for its problems.

<p>Furthermore, it is important to emphasize that for every linux
distribution that comes with Netscape 6 rather than 4, for every Windows
user that upgrades their browser, and for every Netscape/AOL product
that comes with a Gecko-based rendering engine rather than Netscape 4,
there is one fewer headache for web developers, and one step closer to
the time when huge savings in terms of development time, efficiencies
from using CSS properly, can be truly realized.

<p>Rather than giving the impression, which many people have received
from the general hype surrounding Netscape, that Netscape 6 is not a
standards-compliant browser, the true picture is that it is, the most
compliant ever, but with some unfortunate, and highly noticeable thanks
to <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org">Bugzilla</a>,
bugs, but them notwithstanding, the fact is that it is much, much, much
better from a developer point of view for end users to be using Netscape
6 rather than 4, and the only way that this will happen is for Netscape
6 to be released.

with a relational database, you could simply add a new table, but that's a
manual task of changing the *schema*.  I'm not suggesting that XML is

We now have about thirty terabytes of archival material that we data mine. And that's 1.5 times the size of
      all of the books in the Library of Congress. So we're now at an interesting point, we're now beyond the
      largest collection of information ever accumulated by humans. We've gotten somewhere!
       We use as
      our original inspiration the Library of Alexandria. Because they were the first people that tried to collect it
      all. And they started to actually understand the intersection between completely different self-consistent
      belief systems. They knew what the Egyptians, Romans and Greeks, Hebrews, Hittites, Sumerians,
      Babylonians -- they knew the mythologies, because they had it all in one place. And they had the scholars to
      stare at it and try to make the disjunctions conjunctions and start to get an idea of what humans are. The
      dream is that we're in another one of those positions. They got up to five hundred thousand books. Of course,
      they were scrolls. The Library of Congress -- the largest library now -- is seventeen million. Only thirty four
      times more than what we had in 300 B.C. It indicates that the technology hasn't scaled. But now we've
      broken through into a new technology that allows us to bypass the Library of Congress in very little time,
      and the sky's the limit. What can we discover about ourselves as a species? As different peoples? Are we
      couch potatoes or do we actually have independent will? Do we have interests that go beyond the fifteen
      demographics of slotted marketing hell? And what we're finding is, people are interesting, diverse and
      peculiar. They are constantly looking for new things that are of interest to them.

    XML took a lot of static in its early days because it
was "just syntax" - there are certainly a lot of people who want to think
only in terms of object models (groves, DOMs, whatever) and see the syntax
as disposable fluff.  Me, I think syntax is crucial.  Because describing
data structures in a straightforward, interoperable way is really hard to
get right and very often fails.  At the end of the day, if you really want
to interoperate, you have to describe the bits on the wire.  That's what
XML does.
</p>

<p>
Think of it another way... a promise like "my implementation of SQL
(or posix, or DOM, or XLib) will interoperate with yours" is really
hard to keep.  A promise like "I'll ship you well-formed XML docs
containing only the following tags and attributes" is remarkably,
dramatically, repeatably more plausible in the real world.

    XML is a serialization of a logical document structure defined by the XML
Infoset. The Infoset uses the DOM as an API. If an XML document is defined
by the character stream, the document is also defined by the SAX event

from another event source).

We have this notion of "attributes" in C# that allows
                                                you to add declarative information to types and members.
                                                Just as you can say a member is public or private, you also
                                                want to be able to say this one's transacted, or this one's

                                                this generic mechanism, but then we utilize it in all of our
                                                Web services and XML infrastructure. We also give you the
                                                ability to put attributes on classes and on fields in your

                                                become "this" tagname in XML and it needs to go into
                                                "this" XML namespace. You want to be able to say a specific
                                                field in one place becomes an element, and that another
                                                becomes an attribute. You also want to control the schema
                                                of the XML that goes out; control it where you're writing
                                                your class declaration, so that all of the additional
                                                declarative information is available. When attributes are
                                                properly used in this way to decorate your C# code, the

                                                over the wire, and when it comes back we can reconstitute
                                                the object on the other side. It's all done in one place. It's

                                                completion when you build it in the IDE, and we can then

    it's plain that the W3C's vision of URIs is heavily based on using
them to name *abstractions*, and that a good part of the URI community is
having a hard time fitting this into their mental models.  I'm starting to
wonder whether overloading the notion of a URI (particularly in the URL
form) to encompass both addressing sequences of bits and identifying
abstract statements in a form of higher-order-logic is really a good idea.
Maybe the distinction between floor waxes and dessert toppings actually
serves a useful purpose in practice if not in theory and shouldn't be
blurred solely in the name of mathematical elegance.  Imagine a
programming language in which all arithmetic had to be done in terms of
set-theoretic primitives.  It would be extremely elegant, but not very
useful.

    This point needs to be re-emphasized, especially to the folks who WROTE
these specs and know what they really say and really mean: you've created a
monster that has escaped from the lab :~)  Whatever the intent and wording
of the URI spec, people use URIs (well, URLs anyway) everyday and *think*
that they know exactly what they are.  For better or worse, many many web
developers are horribly confused by the notion of an HTTP URI that
identifies an abstract resource rather than a concrete piece of data.

...before XML came along, developers either used
EDI standards like X12 or they used proprietary formats and custom programs
to handle them (usually something simple like tab-delimited or fixed-length
columns). The latter was orders of magnitude more prevalent. There were
plenty of people saying the whole world should be using X12 (or EDIFACT or
whatever), but few did because the barriers to entry were too high. The
standards were too difficult to understand for novices and too difficult to
implement. Available applications were expensive. So most IT shops simply
wrote custom point-to-point interfaces, usually low-tech scripts shuffling
files around via FTP.

Today, most developers using XML are still just trying to solve business

Now that a breakup seems more likely,
                   the omigod chorus has started singing
                   -- "Omigod, consumers will be forced to
                   make actual choices now, which is just a
                   terrible idea because life is so much
                   better if one company does everything
                   for us." This is the Ma Bell argument,
                   the notion that life was so much better
                   when only one phone company did
                   everything for us.

<p>
                   Ma Bell, you'll recall, was a regulated

<p>
    XML does *not* solve the problem of semantic heterogeneity (a topic
discussed in reams of database articles). XML never meant to; nor does it
seem a feasible task. From my perspective, one of the best things I
expected from XML was simply that it would make the *real* semantic
problems visible: it is no longer so easy to miss the substantive
differences behind a veil of syntactic obfuscation. By making the problems
visible, at least we can deal with them consciously and directly.
</p>

<p>
Well, now we're there. XML lets us all see, in plain text and schemas, just
what the differences between two competing systems were to begin with; and
companies that want to interchange, convert, or compromise can do so
explicitly and clearly. The process also helps directly: as companies and
whole industries move to XML, they get a perfect chance to review and
perhaps fix schema problems that have been there a long time.
</p>

<p>
Companies that are arch-rivals may avoid compromise, or even introduce
different schemas just to create incompatibility; I don't think there's
anything we can do about that. But there's a Darwinian process going on
here, and being gratuitously different can lead to extinction. Working
together is more efficient than working alone, and economies of scale favor
standards in the long run.
</p>

<p>
At the same time, perhaps we will find that some of the mavericks have seen
something everybody else missed, and we'll all be tweaking our schemas to
add it.

     XML revolutionizes business because it lets you use commodity components and existing Web
     infrastructures to transfer information.  There's nothing XML can do that couldn't be done by other formats
     riding other protocols, but XML will let you do it cheaper.  You never have to be locked into tools coming
     from a single vendor, and you can monitor and manage the flows using whatever tools you like.
</p>

<p>
     Effectively, this reduces the level of agreement that businesses need to reach in order to exchange
     information.  XML can travel over email, over HTTP, over whatever.  The processing involved is pretty
     generic - there are no magic tricks to be figured out.  You can layer cryptography or workflow on top of
     XML without having to change the information inside the document.  None of these layers are tightly
     bound.  There's no special X-HTTP Web servers need to support in order to transfer XML.

    RDF is nowhere near as difficult as people think.
And it is incredibly significant. I don't think it's an exaggeration to
say that RDF and RDFS will become *the* most important XML technologies
as we try to build a web of information - not presentation. In fact if

Model T was made possible by standardization, and quickly
surpassed custom-made cars within a few years. That doesn't mean
that custom car makers are out of business; there are probably
more custom car makers now than there ever were. But how many

<p> The problem with browsers has been that heretofore the

an immature industry, standardization quickly drives custom
solutions to the edge of the marketplace rather than the center.

<p> If you look at the history of tools, *real* innovations and

were newly possible. Before that you had the choice of

    If you think about it, the namespace idea is the real key to XML
success: namespaces are "versors" of an "infinite-dimension" solution
space. Topologically speaking, while SGML is an single infinite
dimension, XML is an infinite set of infinite dimensions. Mathematically
speaking, you can create a one to one relationship with all the points
of XML to SGML (like it's done considering, for example,
"xsl:stylesheet" like a one dimensional SGML element, rather than the
"stylesheet" element of the "xsl" namespace). This may lead to imply
that SGML and XML have the same "multidimentional" volume. Thus,
namespaces don't alter the topological tissue of XML (which remains flat
and one-dimentional), but simply adds "classes" of elements to allow
elements to share the same name, but have different meanings.
