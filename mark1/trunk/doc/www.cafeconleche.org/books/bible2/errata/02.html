It should read:</p><blockquote>There are some nice features and some good ideas in HTML+TIME. However, the W3C had already given its blessing to SMIL several months before Microsoft proposed HTML+TIME, and SMIL has a lot more momentum and support in the third-party, content creator community. Thus, it seems we're in for yet another knockdown, drag-out, Microsoft-vs.-everybody-else-in-the-known-universe battle which will only leave third-party developers bruised and confused. Web development really would be a lot simpler if Microsoft didn't pick up its toys and go home every time they don't get their way.</blockquote><p>If you ever suspected that Microsoft gets special treatmentfrom the press, you're right. They do, though this is sometimesover the writer's strenuous objections.  I don't know why theydo, but they do. </p><hr /><div align="center">[ <A HREF="../../index.html">Cafe con Leche</A> | Order  from  <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0764532367/cafeaulaitA/">amazon.com</A> | <A HREF="../index.html">The XML Bible Home Page</A> | <A HREF="../index.html#toc">Table of Contents</A> | <A HREF="../chapters/">Sample Chapters</A> | <A HREF="../examples/">Examples</A> | <A HREF="index.html">Errata from other Chapters</A> ]</div><hr />Copyright 2001 <a href="http://www.elharo.com/">Elliotte Rusty Harold</a><br /><a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;elharo%40metalab%2Eunc%2Eedu">elharo&#64;metalab&#46;unc&#46;edu</a><br />Last Modified July 13, 2001</body></html>
