<h1 align=center>XML: Extensible Markup Language</h1>

<CITE>XML: Extensible Markup Language</CITE> was perhaps the first book to discuss how Web page designers (as opposed to programmers)
could use XML to create compelling Web pages. However since it was written in
the first half of 1998, and published in July, 1998 it's beginning to show its age. Several chapters, particularly on XSL and XLL, are seriously out of date.
(See the note <A HREF="msxsl.html">about the missing Microsoft MSXSL</A> for more details).
<P>

<P>
I've now written what is essentially the second edition of <CITE>XML: Extensible Markup Language</CITE>. However due to the vagaries of computer book publishing and the necessity of filling holes in different series, it isn't
called <CITE>XML: Extensible Markup Language, 2nd Edition</CITE>. Instead it's called <CITE>The XML Bible</CITE>. It's also published by IDG Books and should be available in finer computer bookstores everywhere starting August 10.
<CITE>The XML Bible</CITE> costs $49.99, $10.00 more than <CITE>XML: Extensible Markup Language</CITE>; but it's over two and half times larger so you get a lot more XML for your money.  It's also completely up-to-date with all W3C
working drafts through May, 1999. There were some changes in July that aren't reflected in the printed book. Those are being addressed through <A HREF="../bible/updates/">online updates that are available now</A>. I plan to continue making updates available here as long as necessary.  
</P>

<P>
I'll be continuing to maintain this page at as the canonical site for
errata in <CITE>XML: Extensible Markup Language</CITE> and other useful information for readers of that book. However, for updates and the most current information I refer readers to <CITE><A HREF="../bible/">The XML Bible</A></CITE>. 
I've posted three complete chapters from <CITE>The XML Bible</CITE> here on Cafe con Leche that cover the most egregiously out-of-date sections of <CITE>XML: Extensible Markup Language</CITE>:

<P>
All three are completely up-to-date with the latest working drafts 
of their respective specifications.

<P>
If you still want a copy of <CITE>XML: Extensible Markup Language</CITE>, 
you can find <CITE>XML: Extensible Markup Language</CITE> 
at almost any bookstore that
carries computer books including  <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0764531999/cafeaulaitA/">amazon.com</A>. 
It's $39.99, published by IDG Books, and written by me, Elliotte
Rusty Harold.
