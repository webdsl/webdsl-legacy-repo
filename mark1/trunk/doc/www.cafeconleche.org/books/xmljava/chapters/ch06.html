At its core, SAX, the Simple API for XML,
is based on just two interfaces,  the 
<tt>XMLReader</tt> interface that
represents the parser 
and the
<tt>ContentHandler</tt> interface that 
receives data from the parser. These two interfaces alone suffice
for 90% of what you need to do with SAX. This chapter shows the
basic operation of <tt>XMLReader</tt>
and discusses <tt>ContentHandler</tt> in
detail. The next chapter explores a variety of ways to customize
the parsing process through the more advanced features of the
<tt>XMLReader</tt> interface.

    The Simple API for XML, SAX, was invented in late 1997/early 1998
    when Peter Murray-Rust and several 
    authors of XML parsers written in Java
    decided there wasn&#8217;t
    much point to maintaining multiple similar yet incompatible
    APIs to do exactly the same thing. 
    Murray-Rust was the first to suggest what he called 
    &#8220;YAXPAPI&#8221;.
    The reason Murray-Rust wanted Yet Another XML Parser API 
    was that he was thoroughly sick of  supporting multiple,
    incompatible XML parsers for his parser-client application JUMBO.
    Instead, he wanted
    a standard API everyone could agree on.
    Parser authors Tim Bray 
    and David Megginson quickly signed on to the project,
    and work began in public on the xml-dev
    mailing list where many people participated.
    Megginson wrote the initial draft of SAX. 
    After a short beta period, SAX 1.0 was released on May 11, 
    1998.
  </p><p>
    SAX was designed around  abstract
    interfaces rather than concrete classes so
    it could be layered on top of parsers&#8217; existing
    native APIs.
    SAX is not the most sophisticated XML API imaginable,
    but that&#8217;s part of its beauty. The ease with which SAX could
    be implemented by many parser vendors with very different 
    architectures contributed to its success and rapid
    standardization.
  </p><table class="sidebar" border="0"><tr><td width="10%"></td><td width="80%" style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans" cellpadding="5"><p class="title" style="font-size: larger" align="center"><b>SAX in other languages</b></p><p>
    SAX has been unofficially ported to several other 
    object oriented languages
    including C++, Visual Basic, Python, and Perl. The general patterns and
    names of most functions remain the same. However, the details of 
    implementation change quite a bit. For instance, C++ doesn&#8217;t
    have interfaces, but does have multiple inheritance, so 
    <tt>ContentHandler</tt>, <tt>XMLReader</tt>
    and the like become classes containing nothing but pure
    virtual functions. The C++ string classes can&#8217;t handle
    Unicode so parsers must use pointers to arrays of custom types such as
    <tt>XMLCh</tt> instead.
    Unfortunately, there&#8217;s no standard C++ binding
    for SAX so the custom classes
    vary from one parser to the next, and you can&#8217;t easily port
    C++ SAX programs between different compilers and platforms
    in either binary or source form.
  </p><p>
   Although supporting the &#8220;Desperate Perl Hacker&#8221;
   was a goal of the original XML working group,
   Perl has always lagged other languages quite a bit when it 
   comes to XML. The initial problem was the lack of support for
   Unicode, a sine qua non for XML. 
   Today modern Perls have decent Unicode support. To really handle XML
    you  need at least version 5.005_52 of Perl,
    preferably,  5.6.1 or later and ideally 5.8.
    
    </p><p>
   There are several XML parsers available for Perl, though
   far and away the most popular is
   Larry Wall and Clark Cooper&#8217;s XML::Parser. 
   This is a wrapper around James Clark&#8217;s 
   <a href="http://www.jclark.com/xml/expat.html" target="_top">expat</a> 
   XML parser written in C.
   However, this parser isn&#8217;t really SAX compatible though it&#8217;s used in a
   lot of legacy code.
   New projects should use  <a href="http://sax.perl.org/" target="_top">XML::SAX</a> 
   instead. 
   </p><p>
   However, even with this module,
   in my opinion Perl is still not as ideal a language for processing
   XML as you might expect. Perl&#8217;s strength is its ability
   to work with the 
   implicit structure in text documents such as tab delimited text files
   and comma separated values files. However, XML documents tend to
   have very explicit structure that is easily addressed by a
   language like Java. 
   Perl&#8217;s strengths don&#8217;t come into play; but you 
   still suffer the numerous well-known disadvantages of working with Perl,
   The inevitable 
   obfuscation of Perl code seems to me too high a price to pay.
  </p><p>
    Python probably has the best support for SAX and XML of any of the
    non-Java languages.
    XML parsing including a SAX port has been a standard
    part of Python since version 2.0. Furthermore, Python has a
    standard Unicode string type. This is not quite the same as
    Python&#8217;s regular string type, but Python&#8217;s weak typing means
    this isn&#8217;t nearly as big an inconvenience as it is in C++.
    However, the fact remains that SAX is designed in and for Java,
    and Java is certainly the most convenient language with
    which to write SAX programs.

    Although SAX is very much a de facto standard, it has not gone through
    any formal standardization process. Its development
    was open to anyone interested. All you had to do was
    join the xml-dev mailing list and participate in the
    discussions. The end result was explicitly placed in the
    public domain. It is free to be implemented or extended by
    anyone for any purpose without permission from anybody. 
    It is not copyrighted or trademarked. As far as is known,
    no parts of it are patented by anyone either. 
  </p><p>
    In late 1999, work began on SAX2. This was a radical reformulation
    of SAX that, while maintaining the same basic event-oriented
    architecture, replaced almost every class in SAX1. The main
    impetus for this radical shift was the need to make SAX
    namespace aware. However many other new capabilities were added in
    SAX2 including filters and optional support for 
    lexical events and DTDs.
    SAX2 was finished in May 2000, and
    has proven even more successful than SAX1. Indeed SAX2 is the
    most complete XML API available anywhere. In 2002, all major
    parsers that support SAX at all support SAX2. There is no
    reason to learn or concern yourself with the older classes
    and interfaces from SAX1, and henceforth I will discuss SAX2
    exclusively. 
  </p><p>  
    For the first few years of
    its life, the official SAX distribution and documentation
    was maintained by David Megginson. However, he
    recently passed the torch to David Brownell who has begun work
    on SAX 2.1. At the time of this writing, SAX 2.1 seems unlikely
    to be as radical a shift relative to SAX2
    as SAX2 was relative to SAX1. Version 2.1 will add 
    a few bits of information
    from the XML document that are not exposed by SAX2 such as
    the encoding declaration. However, no SAX2 classes,
    interfaces, or methods 
    will be deprecated in SAX 2.1; and only programmers with very 
    special needs will need to concern themselves with the new
    functionality in SAX 2.1.
