   One night five developers, all of whom wore very thick glasses
   and had recently been hired by Elephants, Inc.,
   the world&#8217;s largest purveyor of elephants and elephant supplies, 
   were familiarizing themselves with the 
   company&#8217;s order processing system
   when they stumbled into a directory full of
   XML documents on the main server.
&#8220;What&#8217;s this?&#8221; the team leader asked excitedly.
None of them had ever heard 
 of XML before so they decided to split up the files between
 them and try to figure out just what this strange and wondrous
 new technology actually was. 
</p><p>
The first developer, who specialized in 
optimizing Oracle databases,
 printed out  a stack of FMPXMLRESULT documents generated by the 
 FileMaker database where all the orders were stored,
and began poring over them.
&#8220;So this is XML! Why, it&#8217;s nothing novel.
As anyone can see who&#8217;s able, an XML document is nothing but a
table!&#8221;
</p><p>
&#8220;What do you mean, a table?&#8221; replied the second programmer, 
well versed in object oriented theory and occupied with 
 a collection of  XMI documents that encoded
UML diagrams for the system. 
&#8220;Even a Visual Basic programmer could see that
XML documents aren&#8217;t tables. 

Duplicates aren&#8217;t allowed in a table relation,
unless this is truly some strange mutation. 
Classes and objects is what these document are. 
Indeed, it should be obvious on the very first pass.
 An XML document is an object and a DTD is a class.&#8221;
</p><p>
&#8220;Objects? A strange kind of object, indeed!&#8221; 
said the third developer,
a web designer of some renown, who had loaded the XHTML user documentation for 
the order processing system into Mozilla.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t see any types at all. If you think this is an object, then it&#8217;s
your software I refuse to install. 
But with all those stylesheets there, it should be clear to anyone not sedated,
that  XML is just HTML updated!&#8221;
</p><p>
&#8220;HTML? You must be joking&#8221; said the fourth, a computer
science professor on sabbatical from MIT, who was engrossed in an XSLT
stylesheet that validated all the other documents against a Schematron schema. 
&#8220;Look at the clean nesting of hierarchical structures, each tag
matching its partner as it should. I&#8217;ve never seen HTML that looks
this good. What we have here is S-expressions, which 
is certainly nothing new. Babbage invented this back in 1882!&#8221; 
</p><p>
&#8220;An S expression?&#8221; queried
 the technical writer, who was occupied
with  documentation for the project written in 
DocBook. 
&#8220;Maybe that means something to those in your learned profession. 
But to me, this looks just like a FrameMaker MIF file. 
However, locating the GUI is taking me awhile.&#8221;
</p><p>
  And so they argued into the night, none of them willing to give
  an inch, all of them presenting still more examples to prove
  their points, none of them bothering to look at the others&#8217;
  examples. 
   Indeed, they&#8217;re probably still arguing today.
   You can even hear their shouts from time to time on xml-dev. 
   Their mistake, of course, was in trying to force XML into the
   patterns of technologies they were already familiar with
   rather than taking it on its own terms.
   XML can store data, but it is not a database.
   XML can serialize objects, but an XML document is not an
   object.
   Web pages can be written in XML,
   but XML is not HTML.
   Functional (and other) programming languages can be written in
   XML, but XML is not a programming language. 
   Books are written in XML, but that doesn&#8217;t make XML
   desktop publishing software.
</p><p>
   XML is  something truly new that has not been seen  before in
   the world of computing. There have been precursors to it,
   and there are always fanatics who insist on seeing XML
    through database (or object, or functional, or
   S-expression) colored glasses. But XML is none of these
   things. It is something genuinely unique and new in the world of
   computing; and it can only be understood when you&#8217;re willing to accept it on
   its own terms, rather than forcing it into yesterday&#8217;s pigeon
   holes. 
 </p><p>
    There are a lot of tools, APIs, and applications in the world 
    that try to pretend XML
    is something more familiar to programmers; that it&#8217;s just 
    a funny kind of database, or just like an object,
    or just like remote procedure calls.
    These APIs are occasionally useful in very restricted and
    predictable environments. However, they are
    not suitable for processing XML in its most general format.
    They work well in their limited domains, but they fail when
    presented with XML that steps outside the artificial
    boundaries they&#8217;ve defined. 
    XML was designed to be extensible, but it&#8217;s a sad fact that
    many of the tools designed for XML aren&#8217;t nearly as
    extensible as XML itself. 
  </p><p>
    This book is going to show you how to handle XML in its full
    generality. It pulls no punches. It does not pretend that XML is
    anything except XML, and it shows you how to design your programs
    so that they handle real XML in all its messiness:
    valid and invalid, mixed and unmixed, typed and untyped,
    and both all and none of these at the same time.
    To that end, this book focuses on those APIs that don&#8217;t try
    to hide the XML. In particular, 
    there are three major Java APIs that correctly model XML,
    as opposed to modeling
    a particular class of XML documents or 
    some narrow subset of XML. These are:
  </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>SAX, the Simple API for XML</p></li><li><p>DOM, the Document Object Model</p></li><li><p>JDOM, a Java native API</p></li></ul></div><p>
    These APIs are the core of this book. In addition I cover 
    a number of preliminaries and supplements to the basic APIs including: 
  </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>XML syntax</p></li><li><p>DTDs, schemas, and validity</p></li><li><p>XPath</p></li><li><p>XSLT and the TrAX API</p></li><li><p>JAXP, a combination of SAX, DOM, and TrAX with a few factory classes</p></li></ul></div><p> And, since we&#8217;re going to need a few examples of XML
applications to demonstrate the APIs with, I also cover XML-RPC,
SOAP, and RSS in some detail. However, the techniques this book
teaches are hardly limited to just those three applications.
</p><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e124"></a>Who You Are</h2></div></div><p> This book is written for experienced Java programmers who
want to integrate XML into their systems. Java is the ideal
language for processing XML documents. Its strong Unicode support
in particular made it the preferred language for many early
implementers. Consequently, more XML tools have been written in
Java than in any other language. More open source XML tools are
written
in Java than in any other language. More programmers process XML
in Java than in any other language. </p><p>
<i>Processing XML with Java</i> will teach you how to:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Save XML documents from applications written in Java</p></li><li><p>Read XML documents produced by other programs</p></li><li><p>Search, query, and update XML documents</p></li><li><p>Convert legacy flat data into hierarchical XML</p></li><li><p>Communicate with network servers that send and receive XML data</p></li><li><p>Validate documents against DTDs, schemas, and business rules</p></li><li><p>Combine functional XSLT transforms with traditional imperative Java code</p></li></ul></div><p>
This book is meant for  Java programmers who need to do anything 
with XML. It teaches the fundamentals and advanced topics, leaving 
nothing out. It is a comprehensive course in processing XML with Java 
that takes developers from little knowledge of XML to 
 designing sophisticated XML applications and parsing 
complicated documents. The examples cover a wide range of possible 
uses including file formats, data exchange, document transformation, 
database integration, and more. 
</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e158"></a>What You Need to Know</h3></div></div><p>
  This is not an introductory book with respect to either Java or
  XML. I assume you have substantial prior experience with
  Java and preferably some experience with XML.
  On the Java side, I will freely use 
  advanced features of the language and its class library without 
  explanation or apology. Among other things, I assume
  you are thoroughly familiar with:
  </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Object oriented programming including inheritance and polymorphism</p></li><li><p>Packages and the CLASSPATH. You should not be surprised by classes
    that do not have <tt>main()</tt> methods or that are not in the default package. </p></li><li><p>I/O including streams, readers, and writers.
    You should understand that <tt>System.out</tt> is a horrible example of what 
    really goes on in Java programs. 
    </p></li><li><p>The Java Collections API including hash tables, maps, sets, iterators, and lists. 
    </p></li></ul></div><p>
    
    In addition, in one or two places in this book I&#8217;m going to 
    use some SQL and JDBC.
    However, these sections are relatively independent of the rest of the book;
    and chances are if you aren&#8217;t already familiar with SQL, then you don&#8217;t
    need the material in these sections anyway. 
  </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e184"></a>What You Need to Have</h3></div></div><p> XML is deliberately architecture, platform, operating
system, GUI, and language agnostic (in fact, more so than Java).
It works equally well on Mac OS, Windows, Linux, OS/2,
various flavors of Unix,
and more. It can be processed with Python, C++, Haskell,
ECMAScript, C#, Perl, Visual Basic, Ruby, and of course Java. No
byte order issues need concern you if you switch between PowerPC, X86, or
other architectures. Almost everything in this book should work
equally well on any platform that&#8217;s capable of running
Java. </p><p> Most of the material in this book is relatively
independent of the specific Java version. Java 1.4 bundles SAX,
DOM, and a few other useful classes into the core JDK. However,
these are easily installed in earlier JVMs as open source
libraries from the Apache XML Project and other vendors. For the
most part, I used Java 1.3 and 1.4 when testing the examples; and
it&#8217;s possible that a few classes and methods have been used that
are not available in earlier versions. In most cases, it should
be fairly obvious how to backport them. All of the basic XML APIs
except TrAX should work in Java 1.1 and later. TrAX requires Java
1.2 or later. </p></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="index.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="index.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="pr01s02.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Processing XML with Java&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;How to Use This Book</td></tr></table></div><hr xmlns:dt="http://xsltsl.org/date-time"><table xmlns:dt="http://xsltsl.org/date-time" width="100%" summary="Cafe con Leche footer"><tr><td width="34%" align="left">Copyright 2001, 2002 Elliotte Rusty Harold</td><td width="32%" align="center"><a href="mailto:elharo@metalab.unc.edu">elharo@metalab.unc.edu</a></td><td width="34%" align="right">Last Modified
