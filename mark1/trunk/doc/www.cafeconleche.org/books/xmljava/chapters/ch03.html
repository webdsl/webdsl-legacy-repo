No one ever believes me when I tell them how easy it is to develop 
programs that write XML documents. In fact, writing a program to
output an XML document is unbelievably trivial. It&#8217;s something
an eight-year old typing BASIC in their first class
at computer camp can do. In Java, it&#8217;s even easier than that due to
Java&#8217;s strong Unicode support.
You don&#8217;t need to know any special APIs like DOM or SAX or JDOM.
All you have to know is how to <tt>System.out.println()</tt>. 
If you want to store your XML document in a file, you can
use the 
<tt>FileOutputStream</tt> class instead. 
If you want to serve the document dynamically over a network, it
helps to know something about servlets;
but in the end it all reduces to writing bytes onto 
an output stream.
</p><p>
  In this chapter, I&#8217;m going to develop a program that
  writes Fibonacci numbers into an XML document.
  I chose this example because the Fibonacci numbers are a well-known 
  series that&#8217;s very easy to generate algorithmically
  so the examples will be nicely self-contained. 
  However, the principles of XML you learn here will be much more
  broadly applicable to other, more complex systems.
  The key idea is that data arrives from some source,
  is encoded in XML, and is then output.
  Where the input comes from, whether an algorithm, a file,
  a network socket, user input, or some other source,
  really doesn&#8217;t concern us here. 
</p><p>
  I&#8217;m going to show you how to use classes you&#8217;re already familiar with like
  <tt>OutputStreamWriter</tt>, <tt>String</tt>, 
  and <tt>HTTPServlet</tt> to generate XML documents.
  I am going to beat this idea into the ground until you are absolutely convinced that
  there is nothing special about XML documents that requires any fancy tricks to
  produce them. Once you&#8217;ve finished this chapter you&#8217;ll be thoroughly  
  immunized against the snake-oil peddlers who want to sell you
  multi-hundred thousand dollar software to do what you can do 
  with your existing systems for free.

    As far as we know, the Fibonacci series was first
  discovered by Leonardo of Pisa around 1200 C.E.
  Leonardo was trying to answer the question,
  
  &#8220;<i>Quot paria coniculorum in 
  uno anno ex uno pario germinatur?</i>&#8221;, or, 
  in English, &#8220;How many pairs of rabbits are born in one year from one pair?&#8221;
    To solve his problem, 
  Leonardo estimated that rabbits have a 
  one month gestation period, and can first mate at the age of one 
  month, so that each female rabbit has its first litter at two months. 
  He made the simplifying assumption that each litter consisted of exactly
  one male and one female.  
</p><p>
  Leonardo begins with one pair of baby rabbits, a male and a female. 
  At the end of the first month,
  these two have reached puberty and mate. There&#8217;s still one pair of rabbits.
  At the end of the second month, the female gives birth to a new pair of rabbits.
  There are now two pairs of rabbits, one pair of adults and one pair of babies. 
  The adult pair mates again, so that they will
  produce one more pair at the end of the third month, at which point there are now
  three pairs of rabbits. One of these pairs has just been born, but the other two
  are old enough to mate, which, being rabbits, they do.
  At the end of the third month, two of the three pairs have babies producing five pairs of rabbits.
  Meanwhile all rabbits born in previous months mate, so that at the end of the fourth month
  there will be three more pairs of rabbits. Leonardo realized that 
  the number of pairs at the end of each month was the sum of
  the number of pairs the preceding month and the number of pairs the 
  month before that. The rabbits don&#8217;t simply double in population
  each month because it takes two months before a rabbit can have 
  its first litter. Nonetheless, the numbers do grow only slightly
  more slowly than exponentially; and
   the process continues indefinitely, at least 
  until you run out of rabbit food or the rabbits take over the world, 
  whichever comes first. 
  The number of pairs each month&#8212;1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...&#8212;
  has come to be known as the Fibonacci series
  after Leonardo&#8217;s Latin nickname, Fibonacci (short for 
  <i>filius Bonacci</i>,
  son of Bonacci).
  </p><p>
   The rabbits aren&#8217;t so important, but the math is. 
   Each integer in the series is formed
   by the sum of the two previous integers. The first two integers in the series
   are 1 and 1.<sup>[<a name="d0e4909" href="#ftn.d0e4909">1</a>]</sup> The Fibonacci series turns up in some very unexpected places
   including decimal expansions of &#960;, the golden ratio,
   the Mandelbrot set,  the number of petals on many flowers,
   the number of spirals on pine cones and pineapples,
   the number of chambers in a Nautilus shell, and many more.
  </p><p>
   It&#8217;s very easy to calculate the Fibonacci sequence
   by computer. A simple <tt>for</tt> loop will do. For example,
   this code fragment prints the first 40 Fibonacci numbers: 
  </p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">    int low = 1;
    int high = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i &lt;= 40; i++) {
      System.out.println(low);
      int temp = high;
      high = high+low;
      low = temp;
    }</pre></div><p>
   However, the Fibonacci numbers do grow very large very quickly,
   and exceed the bounds of an <tt>int</tt> shortly before the fiftieth
    generation.
   Consequently, it&#8217;s better to use the 
   <tt>java.math.BigInteger</tt>
   class instead, as <a href="ch03.html#FibonacciNumbers.java" title="Example&nbsp;3.1.&nbsp;A program that calculates the Fibonacci numbers">Example&nbsp;3.1</a> demonstrates:
  </p><div class="example"><a name="FibonacciNumbers.java"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;3.1.&nbsp;A program that calculates the Fibonacci numbers</b></p><pre class="programlisting">import java.math.BigInteger;

public class FibonacciNumbers {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
  
    BigInteger low  = BigInteger.ONE;
    BigInteger high = BigInteger.ONE;
    for (int i = 1; i &lt;= 10; i++) {
      System.out.println(low);
      BigInteger temp = high;
      high = high.add(low);
      low = temp;
    }
    
  }

}
</pre></div><p>
   When run, this program produces the first ten Fibonacci numbers:
  </p><pre class="screen">
<tt>C:\XMLJAVA&gt;</tt><b><tt>java FibonacciNumbers</tt></b>
<tt>1
1
2
3
5
8
13
21
34
55</tt></pre><p>
   It would be straightforward to read
    the number of Fibonacci numbers to generate from the command line.
    However, since user interfaces aren&#8217;t the focus of this book,
    I don&#8217;t want to obscure the important parts with too much extraneous 
    fluff. 
  </p></div><div class="footnotes"><br><hr width="100" align="left"><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a name="ftn.d0e4909" href="#d0e4909">1</a>] </sup>
   In some variations, the first two 
   integers are 0 and 1. Aside from the initial zero, 
   this produces the same series.</p></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch02s08.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="index.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ch03s02.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Summary&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;Writing XML</td></tr></table></div><hr xmlns:dt="http://xsltsl.org/date-time"><table xmlns:dt="http://xsltsl.org/date-time" width="100%" summary="Cafe con Leche footer"><tr><td width="34%" align="left">Copyright 2001, 2002 Elliotte Rusty Harold</td><td width="32%" align="center"><a href="mailto:elharo@metalab.unc.edu">elharo@metalab.unc.edu</a></td><td width="34%" align="right">Last Modified
