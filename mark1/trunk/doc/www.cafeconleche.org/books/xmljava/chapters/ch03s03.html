    Most of the time you don&#8217;t 
    want to dump an XML document to <tt>System.out</tt>.
    Instead you want to write it in a file or onto
    a network socket. You might even store it in a string
    and pass it to some other process. What connects all
    these possible targets in Java is the 
    <tt>java.io.OutputStream</tt> class.
    Files, sockets, and even strings can all be treated
    as just another kind of stream.
  </p><p>
    XML documents are text. The text is made up of Unicode characters.
    When those Unicode characters are actually written 
    onto a stream, you need to pick a character encoding
    that specifies how each character is converted into bytes. 
    This encoding can be
    one of the Unicode encodings such as UTF-8 or UTF-16
    or it can be a local code page such as ISO-8859-1 or
    MacRoman. Characters that don&#8217;t exist in the local code page
    can be escaped using numeric character references. 
    The encoding declaration will be set to indicate the character set in use.
    The normal way Java converts characters into bytes in a specific encoding
    is by chaining an <tt>OutputStreamWriter</tt> to an  <tt>OutputStream</tt>.
    As chars and strings are written onto the <tt>OutputStreamWriter</tt>,
    they are converted to bytes in the specified encoding which are then written
    onto the underlying <tt>OutputStream</tt>.  
  </p><p>
    Let&#8217;s suppose you want to dump the Fibonacci numbers into a file
    called <tt>fibonacci.xml</tt> in the current working directory.
    First you would open a <tt>FileOutputStream</tt> to that file,
    like this:
  </p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">OutputStream fout = new FileOutputStream("fibonacci.xml");</pre></div><p>
    If performance is at all a concern, you would immediately chain
    this <tt>FileOutputStream</tt> to a <tt>BufferedOutputStream</tt>
    like this:
  </p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">OutputStream bout = new BufferedOutputStream(fout);</pre></div><p>
    Then you would chain the <tt>BufferedOutputStream</tt> to 
    an <tt>OutputStreamWriter</tt>. You&#8217;d pass the Java name of the
    encoding you want as the second argument to the
    <tt>OutputStreamWriter()</tt> constructor.
    For example, this line chooses the ISO-8859-1, Latin-1 encoding, though it uses Java&#8217;s 
    name for this encoding, &#8220;8859_1&#8221;:
  </p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">OutputStreamWriter out = new OutputStreamWriter(bout, "8859_1");</pre></div><p>
    Finally, you&#8217;d write the output onto that <tt>OutputStreamWriter</tt>, making
    sure to include the right encoding declaration using the XML name for
    the encoding. <a href="ch03s03.html#FibonacciFile.java" title="Example&nbsp;3.9.&nbsp;A Java program that writes an XML file">Example&nbsp;3.9</a> demonstrates. 
  </p><div class="example"><a name="FibonacciFile.java"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;3.9.&nbsp;A Java program that writes an XML file</b></p><pre class="programlisting">import java.math.BigInteger;
import java.io.*;


public class FibonacciFile {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
   
      BigInteger low  = BigInteger.ONE;
      BigInteger high = BigInteger.ONE;      
      
      try {        
        OutputStream fout= new FileOutputStream("fibonacci.xml");
        OutputStream bout= new BufferedOutputStream(fout);
        OutputStreamWriter out 
         = new OutputStreamWriter(bout, "8859_1");
      
        out.write("&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" ");
        out.write("encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\"?&gt;\r\n");  
        out.write("&lt;Fibonacci_Numbers&gt;\r\n");  
        for (int i = 1; i &lt;= 10; i++) {
          out.write("  &lt;fibonacci index=\"" + i + "\"&gt;");
          out.write(low.toString());
          out.write("&lt;/fibonacci&gt;\r\n");
          BigInteger temp = high;
          high = high.add(low);
          low = temp;
        }
        out.write("&lt;/Fibonacci_Numbers&gt;\r\n"); 
        
        out.flush();  // Don't forget to flush!
        out.close();
      }
      catch (UnsupportedEncodingException e) {
        System.out.println(
         "This VM does not support the Latin-1 character set."
        );
      }
      catch (IOException e) {
        System.out.println(e.getMessage());        
      }

  }

}
</pre></div><p>
    One change from the <tt>System.out</tt> version
     is that
    the line breaks have to be encoded explicitly.
    They&#8217;re not really necessary for this XML document,
    but the examples are prettier if the XML isn&#8217;t just one long line
    of text. I recommend using a carriage-return/linefeed pair 
    (<tt>\r\n</tt>)
    as your line
    break. This is the native format for DOS and Windows, and most 
    Unix and Macintosh text editors can handle it.
    More importantly it is the standard line ending for network protocols
    such as HTTP and SMTP.
    XML  parsers do normalize all line breaks to a single linefeed on input,
    so the proper choice of line break for an XML document
    is not nearly as fraught as for some other types of files.
    Nonetheless, picking  carriage-return/linefeed does help
    when processing or transmitting XML documents with non-XML-aware
    tools.
  </p><p>
    Although most XML parsers written in Java support exactly those
    encodings that are available in Java,
    they don&#8217;t use the same names. Java tends to use underscores where
    XML uses hyphens in encoding names, or to eliminate the hyphens completely.
    The reason is that earlier Java virtual machines used 
    reflection to locate the classes that
    convert between different encodings, so its encoding names had to be
    legal Java class names. 
    <a href="ch03s03.html#encoding_table" title="Table&nbsp;3.1.&nbsp;Standard Character Sets and Encodings">Table&nbsp;3.1</a> lists the Java and XML equivalents of the
    standard character sets and encodings. Later versions of Java often allow
    multiple names for the same encoding, especially in Java 1.4.
    Here I&#8217;ve picked the names that are supported across the broadest 
    range of virtual machines.

    I have deliberately omitted XML legal encodings that are not yet supported by Java
    such as ISO-8859-10, ISO-8859-11, ISO-8859-14, and ISO-8859-16.
    It&#8217;s not hard to add them in Java 1.4; but since they&#8217;re not available by default, 
    you&#8217;re better
    off picking UTF-8 or one of the other encodings of Unicode. 
  </p><p>
    The exact list of encodings Java supports varies from virtual machine to
    virtual machine and
    version to version. Java 1.4 is a major leap forward in support
    for many character sets, as well as for different aliases for character
    set names. However, since the standard Unicode and ISO encodings 
    let you handle most environments today, there&#8217;s little reason to use
    other encodings in XML documents.
  </p><p>
    Some parsers, including Xerces-J, have an option to recognize the Java names,
    as well as all the other encodings Java supports.
    This can be useful when you&#8217;re reading XML documents sent to you by other 
    people and systems. However, you should not generate documents that
    use these encodings. The standard encodings in <a href="ch03s03.html#encoding_table" title="Table&nbsp;3.1.&nbsp;Standard Character Sets and Encodings">Table&nbsp;3.1</a>
    should be sufficient for any document you need to create, and are a lot more
    cross-platform compatible than platform-specific code pages such as Cp1252
    and MacRoman. In a few cases you might prefer to use
    standard non-Unicode, non-ISO national character sets such as 
    KS C 5601 for Korean or KOI8-R for Cyrillic. These are OK too, but still
    a little less well recognized around the world than the standard encodings
    shown in <a href="ch03s03.html#encoding_table" title="Table&nbsp;3.1.&nbsp;Standard Character Sets and Encodings">Table&nbsp;3.1</a>.
    The general principle is to be conservative in what you generate, 
    but liberal in what you accept.
    Try to stick to the most standard encodings when writing documents,
    but accept any encoding you recognize when reading documents.
  </p><p>
    Other character sets you should not use in XML but that are
    available in Java include UTF-16BE and UTF16-LE. These are big-endian and
    little-endian encodings of Unicode without an explicit byte order mark.
    XML documents in UTF-16 must have an explicit byte order mark.
    It may not be omitted. UTF-8 documents may have a byte order mark,
    but in general should not for maximum compatibility with
    other software.
