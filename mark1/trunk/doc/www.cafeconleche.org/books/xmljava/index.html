<h1 class="title">Processing XML with Java</h1>

<p>
Welcome to <cite>Processing XML with Java</cite>,
a complete tutorial about 
writing Java programs that read and write XML documents.
This is the most comprehensive and up-to-date book about
integrating XML with Java (and vice versa) you can buy. It contains over 
1000 pages of detailed information on SAX, DOM, JDOM, JAXP, TrAX, XPath, 
XSLT, SOAP, and lots of other juicy acronyms. This book is written for Java programmers 
who want to learn how to read and write XML documents from their code.
The paper version is published by
Addison-Wesley, and can be found at fine bookstores everywhere
including <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN%3D0201771861/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/">Amazon</a> 
and  
<a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0201771861">Barnes &amp; Noble</a>. 
The list price is 
$54.95, but most bookstores are offering their usual discounts.
</p>

<p>
Normally, this is the point where I'd spend a few paragraphs describing just what's in the book and
how important it is to your education, your career, and your love life; 
but this time I've done something a little different. 
The entire book is available online. 
You can read every chapter and every page so you can see for yourself  how well this book answers your questions such as,
"<a href="http://cafeconleche.org/books/xmljava/chapters/ch06s07.html">Why 
does SAX truncate  the text in my documents after a few thousand characters?</a>"
"<a href="http://cafeconleche.org/books/xmljava/chapters/ch13.html">How do I 
serialize a DOM <code>Document</code> object
 in an implementation-independent way?</a>" or, 
 "<a href="http://www.mentalwardfilm.com/falcon1.htm">Why doesn't 
 my significant other understand the importance of a building a life size Millennium Falcon in our backyard?</a>" 
Consequently, I'll forego the usual hype. Check the book out for yourself.
The entire book is
here at Cafe con Leche. You can read every word of it,
all seventeen chapters and two appendixes.
If you like it, please buy a copy. 
I promise it's cheaper than printing all 1100+ pages on your laser printer. 
</p>

However, as I'm writing it, I'm going to be posting the entire book
here at Cafe con Leche. You can read every word of it, more or less
as I write it. Right now the first draft  is available. 
 This is composed of seventeen chapters and two appendixes,
organized as follows:

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>
I've extracted out all the <a href="examples/index.html">examples</a> 
into individual files.
You can download them as a <a href="xmljava_examples.zip">zip archive</a> if you like.
</p>

<!--
<p>
Several of the examples in the book communicate with web services
running on 
http://www.elharo.com. Unfortunately, between the time the book went to press and now,
an upgrade to that server necessitated by security concerns
broke a number of URLs published in the book. The services are still running,
just not at quite the same URLs.
I think in all cases you can access them by
changing /fibonacci to /fibonacci/servlet. 
For instance, Example 3-10, most of the examples in Chapter 5,
and Example 6-10
 attempt to communicate with
a servlet running at http://www.elharo.com/fibonacci/XML-RPC.
Instead you can connect to http://www.elharo.com/fibonacci/servlet/XML-RPC.
In Example 3-11, you would change http://www.elharo.com/fibonacci/SOAP
to http://www.elharo.com/fibonacci/servlet/SOAP and so forth.
</p>

<p>
Or at least you would be able to if I hadn't broken Tomcat 
completely in an effort to fix the URLs. 
Neither the servlets themselves nor Tomcat
are running on that box right now. I think it may be time to 
throw out the Qube and replace it with a a generic Redhat system running
generic Apache. I'm less and less thrilled with the Qube's weirdness 
on a daily basis. I don't want to do that because the Qube occupies less space and draws 
less power, but I realy do need to get this running again. 
Bleah.
</p>

<p>
I do not know why the new version of the Java Development Kit for the Cobalt Qube
will not let me map the servlets to the shorter URLs. I just know that it won't.
If you anyone has a supposition as to how I might fix this so that 
the shorter URLs work again, please let me know.
I've been tearing my hair out trying to fix this.
This is using a special version of Tomcat 3.2.1 for Sun's 
Cobalt Qube.

<h2>Contacting the Author</h2>
<p>
Your commentary and feedback is much desired, both on major issues
(e.g. "Why don't you cover JAXB?") and minor ones 
("<i>Cat</i> is misspelled in the first sentence of page 42.")
Please send all feedback directly to me
at <a href="mailto:elharo@metalab.unc.edu">elharo@metalab.unc.edu</a>.
</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>
This is not an introductory book.
It assumes that you're completely familiar with Java including
objects, classes, polymorphism,
I/O, network programming, and more. It also assumes that
you're familiar with XML at about the level
of the <cite><a href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/bible2/">XML Bible, 
2nd Edition</a></cite>. In many ways this book picks up where that one left
off.
</p>

<h2>Copying these Files</h2>

<p>
I'd like to ask that you not mirror these files on
your own servers. It's difficult to keep multiple, 
unoffical mirrors in sync, and I don't
want to deal with questions based on out of date copies.
This site is hosted on the very fast, very well-connected 
IBiblio servers near the 
Internet backbone and should have enough bandwidth for everyone.
If you want to save a copy on your local hard drive for your own
use, feel free, However, please 
don't pass out copies of your own copies to anyone else.
Instead refer your friends and colleagues to this web site.
</p>

<!--
<p>
For now the files are available as you see them here in HTML.
Once I get the stylesheets more debugged, I'll probably
make a bundle of the full files available in
Docbook, PDF, and other HTML formats as well.
However, right now I'm concentrating on writing.
Some of these tasks are going to have to wait until
the book is more complete and changing less quickly. 
</p>
-->

<h2>Colophon</h2>

<p>
This entire book was written in XML from start to finish.
The specific XML application used is DocBook 4.2.0.
I use the <a href="http://www.jedit.org/">jEdit</a> text editor 
on Windows and Linux to write.
 XInclude is used to merge the individual chapters and examples
 together.
Michael Kay's SAXON XSLT processor and Norm Walsh's
XSL stylesheets for Docbook 1.52.2 produce the HTML and XSL-FO
output. I use FOP 0.20.4 to convert the XSL-FO files to PDFs. 
The DocBook source files were pulled into Adobe FrameMaker to 
layout the printed book.
