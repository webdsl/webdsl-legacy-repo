already stated in the preface, this is not an introductory book or an
XML tutorial. I assume that you're familiar with the basic structure
of an XML document as elements that contain text, that you know how
to ask a parser to read an XML document in your language of choice,
that you can attach a style sheet to a document as necessary and so
forth.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">However, I
have noticed over the last few years that certain words and phrases
have taken on a diverse set of meanings, and are often used
inconsistently. Sometimes this just confuses people, but occasionally
it's led to serious process failures. Some of this has been caused by
authors and trainers (embarrassingly sometimes including the author
of this book) who weren't sufficiently careful with their use of
words such as <I>element</I> and <I>tag</I>.  However, some of the
confusion rests with the XML working groups at the W3C who are often
not consistent with each other or even within the same specification.
Before we proceed with the detailed rules, it is worth taking the
time to define our terms carefully, make sure we agree which words
mean what, as well as recognizing those areas where there are genuine
disagreements about the meaning of common technical terms.

these terms often causes much misunderstanding regarding how various
APIs and tools work. For instance, if you think that a character
reference is an entity reference, you may find yourself wondering why
the SAX startEntity method is never invoked for character references
in your documents. When you ask a question about this on a mailing
list, you may not phrase your question in a way that others can
understand. You might even spend several hours carefully devising a
test case and filing a bug report on a feature that's operating
exactly as it should.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">The
answers to many apparently difficult questions become almost obvious
when you're careful to state exactly what you mean. Thus it behooves
us to define our terms carefully.</P>

	<LI><H1 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Element vs. Tag</H1>
</OL>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">An element
is not a tag and a tag is not an element. An element begins with a
start-tag, includes some content, and then finishes with an end-tag.
Tags delimit elements. They are part of elements, but not themselves
elements, any more than a piece of bread is a sandwich. The tags are
like slices of bread. The element is the entire sandwich made up of
bread, mustard and mayonnaise,  meat and/or cheese. The tags are just
the bread. For example, &lt;Headline&gt; is a start-tag. &lt;/Headline&gt;
is an end-tag. &lt;Headline&gt;Record Crowd Hears Beth
Giggle&lt;/Headline&gt; is a complete element. Elements may contain
other elements. Tags may not contain other tags. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">There is
one degenerate case. A single empty-element tag may represent an
entire element. For instance, &lt;Headline/&gt; is both a headline
tag and a headline element. However, this is a special case. It is
not true in general. Semantically the empty-element tag is completely
equivalent to the two-tag version &lt;Headline&gt;&lt;/Headline&gt;,
and most APIs will not bother to inform you which of the two forms
was actually present in the document. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">In brief,
the structure of an XML document is formed by nested elements. The
individual elements are delimited by tags.</P>

	<LI><H1 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Attribute vs. Attribute Value</H1>
</OL>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">An
attribute is a property of an element. It has a name and a value, and
is normally a part of the element's start-tag. (It can also be
defaulted in from the DTD.) For example, consider this element:</P>
<PRE LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">&lt;Headline page=&quot;10&quot;&gt;Record Crowd Hears Beth Giggle&lt;/Headline&gt;</PRE><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">
The headline element has a page attribute with the value 10. The
attribute includes both the name and the value. The attribute value
is simply the string 10. Either single or double quotes may surround
the attribute value. The type of quote used is not significant. This
element is exactly the same as the previous one:</P>
<PRE LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">&lt;Headline page='10'&gt;Record Crowd Hears Beth Giggle&lt;/Headline&gt;</PRE><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">
If an element has multiple attributes, their order is not important.
These two elements are equivalent:</P>
<PRE LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">&lt;Headline id=&quot;A3&quot; page=&quot;10&quot;&gt;Record Crowd Hears Beth Giggle&lt;/Headline&gt;
<SPAN LANG="en-US">&lt;Headline page=&quot;10&quot; id=&quot;A3&quot;&gt;Record Crowd Hears Beth Giggle&lt;/Headline&gt;</SPAN></PRE><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">
Parsers do not tell you which attribute came first. If order matters,
you need to use child elements instead of attributes:</P>
<PRE LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">&lt;Headline&gt;
<SPAN LANG="en-US">  &lt;id&gt;A3&lt;/id&gt; &lt;page&gt;10&lt;/page&gt;</SPAN>

<SPAN LANG="en-US">&lt;/Headline&gt;</SPAN></PRE><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">
It's not exactly a terminology confusion, but a few technologies
(notably the W3C XML Schema Language) have recently dug themselves
into deep holes by attempting to treat attributes and child elements
as variations of the same thing. They are not. Order is only one of
the differences between child elements and attributes. Other
important differences include type, normalization, and the ability or
inability to express substructure.

	<LI><H1 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Entity vs. Entity Reference</H1>
</OL>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">An entity
is a storage unit that contains a piece of an XML document. This
storage unit may be a file, a database record, an object in memory, a
stream of bytes returned by a network server, or something else. It
may contain an entire XML document or just a few elements or
declarations.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">Entity
references point to these entities. There are two kinds of entity
references, general entity references and parameter entity
references. A general entity reference begins with an ampersand; for
instance &amp;amp; or &amp;chapter1;. These normally appear in the
instance document. For example, you might define the chapter1 entity
in the DTD like this:</P>
<PRE LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">&lt;!ENTITY SYSTEM chapter1 &quot;http://www.example.com/chapter1.xml&quot;&gt;</PRE><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">
Then in the document you could reference it like this:</P>
<PRE LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">&lt;book&gt;
<SPAN LANG="en-US">  &amp;chapter1;</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">...</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">&lt;/book&gt;</SPAN></PRE><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">
&amp;chapter1; is an entity reference. The actual content of the
document found at  http://www.example.com/chapter1.xml is an entity.
They are related, but they are not the same thing.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">Parameter
entities and parameter entity references follow the same pattern. The
difference is that parameter entities contain DTD fragments instead
of instance document fragments and parameter entity references begin
with a percent sign instead of an ampersand. However, it's still the
case that the entity reference stands in for and points to the actual
entity.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">XML APIs
are schizophrenic about whether they report entities, entity
references, neither, or both. Some, like XOM, simply replace all
entity references with their corresponding entities and don't tell
you that anything has happened. Others, like JDOM, only report
entities they have not resolved. Still others such as DOM and SAX can
report both entities and entity references, though this often depends
on user preferences and the abilities of the underlying parser; and
normally the five predefined entity references &amp;amp;, &amp;lt;,
&amp;gt;, &amp;quot; and &amp;apos; are not reported.</P>
<OL START=4>
	<LI><H1 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Entity Reference vs. Character
	Reference</H1>
</OL>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">Not
everything that begins with an ampersand is an entity reference.
<I>Entity references</I> are only used for named entities, including
the five predefined entity references such as &amp;lt; and any
entities defined with ENTITY declarations in the DTD such as
&amp;chapter1; in the example above. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">By
contrast character references use a hexadecimal or decimal Unicode
value to refer to a particular character, not a name. Each always
refers to a single character, never to a group of characters. For
example, &amp;#xA0; is a hexadecimal character reference referring to
the non-breaking space character. &amp;#160; is a decimal character
reference referring to that same character. However, XHTML's &amp;nbsp;
is an entity reference referring to that character.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">Almost
always, even APIs that faithfully report all entity references do not
report character references. Instead, the parser silently merges the
referenced characters into the surrounding text. Your code should
never depend on whether a character was typed literally or escaped
with a character reference. Almost all of the time, it shouldn't
depend on whether the character was escaped with an entity reference
either.</P>

plain text, another quote child element, some more plain text, the

together, including all the content of child elements such as quote,
is the para element's content.

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">The para
element has two child elements, both named quote. However, these are
not the only children of the element. This element also contains a
comment, lots of character data, and an entity reference. These are
considered to be children of the para element as well, though
different APIs and systems differ in exactly how they represent these
and how many text children there are. At one extreme, each separate
character can be a separate child. At the other extreme, each text
node contains the maximum contiguous run of text after all entity
references are resolved so the para element has exactly four text
node children.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">On the
flip side, the foreignphrase element and other content inside the
quote elements are not children of the para element though they are
descendants of it.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">The common
reason for confusing children with child elements is forgetting about
the very real possibility of mixed content. However, even when a

It may look like this element only has child elements. However, if
you're counting child nodes you have to count the white space too.
There are at least ten text node children containing only white

no child elements. Bottom line: elements are not the only kind of

and stop parsing. They may not attempt to guess what the document
author intended. They may not fix the error and continue. They have
to drop the document on the floor.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">Validity
is stronger constraint than well-formedness, but it's not required in
order to process XML documents. Validity describes which elements and
attributes are allowed to appear where. It indicates whether a
document adheres to the constraints listed in the document type
definition (DTD) and the document type declaration (DOCTYPE). Even if
a document does not adhere to these constraints, it may still be
usefully processed in some cases. The decision of whether and how to
reject invalid documents is made by the client application, not by
the parser.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">The word
valid is also sometimes used to refer to validity with respect to a
schema rather than a DTD. In cases, where this seems likely to be
confusing, particularly where one is likely to want to validate a
document against a DTD and against some other schema, the word
<I>schema-valid</I> is used. As with DTD validity, whether and how to
handle a schema-invalid document is a decision for the client
application. A schema-validating parser will inform the client
application that a document is invalid. However, it will continue to
parse it. The client application gets to decide whether to accept the
document or not.</P>

type definition is a collection of ELEMENT, ATTLIST, ENTITY and

Whether the DTD is internal, external, or both, it is never the same
thing as the document type declaration. The document type declaration
specifies the root element. The DTD does not. The DTD specifies the

declaration does not. Most APIs routinely expose the contents of the
document type declaration but not those of the document type

for various technical reasons the following construct, which appears

<PRE LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;</PRE><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">

	<LI><H1 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Character Set vs. Character
	Encoding</H1>
</OL>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">XML is
based on the Unicode character set. A character set is a collection
of characters assigned to particular numbers called code points.
Currently Unicode 3.2 defines more than 90,000 individual characters.
Each character in the set is mapped to a number such as 64, 812, or
87000. These numbers are not ints, shorts, bytes, longs or any other 
numeric data type. They are simply numbers. Other character sets such
as SJIS and Latin-1 contain different collections of characters which
are assigned to different numbers, though there's often substantial
overlap with the Unicode character set. That is, many character sets
assign some or all of their characters to the same numbers Unicode
assigns those characters to.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">A
character encoding represents the members of a character set as bytes
in a particular way. There are multiple encodings of Unicode
including UTF-8, UTF-16, UCS-2, UCS-4, UTF-32, and several other more
obscure ones. Different encodings may encode the same code point
using a different sequence of bytes and/or a different number of
bytes. They may use big-endian or little-endian data. They can even
use non-twos complement representations. They may use two bytes or
four bytes for each character. They may even use different numbers of
bytes for different characters.  
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">Changing
the character set changes which characters can be represented. For
instance, the ISO-8859-7 set includes Greek letters. The ISO-8859-1
set  does not. Changing the character encoding does not change which
characters can be used. It merely changes how each character is
encoded in bytes. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">XML
parsers always convert characters in other sets to Unicode before
reporting them to the client application. In effect, they treat other
character sets as different encodings of some subset of Unicode.
Thus, XML doesn't ever really let you change the character set. This
is always Unicode. It only lets you adjust how those characters are
represented.

</OL>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">A URI
identifies a resource. A URI reference identifies a part of a
resource. A URI reference may contain a fragment identifier separated
from the URI by an octothorpe (#). A plain URI may not. For example,
http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/ is a URI.
http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/#Philosophy is a URI reference.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">Most XML
related specifications such as Namespaces in XML are actually defined
in terms of URI references rather than URIs. For example, the W3C XML
Schema language simple type xsd:anyURI actually indicates that
elements with that type are URI references. In casual conversation
and writing, most people don't bother to make the distinction.
Nonetheless, it can be important. For example, the system identifier
in the document type declaration can be a URI but not a URI
reference.</P>

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">I've heard
it claimed that relative URIs are URI references, not true URIs, and
the authors of the XML specification seem to have believed this.
However, the URI specification, RFC 2396, does not support this
belief. It clearly describes both relative URIs and relative URI
references. Perhaps the authors intended to require all URIs to be
absolute; but if this is the case, they failed to do so. The only
difference between a URI and a URI reference is that the latter
allows a fragment identifier while the former does not.</P>

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">Currently,
the IETF is working on Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs).
These are similar to URIs except that they allow non-ASCII characters
such as &zeta;  and &eacute; that must be percent escaped in URIs.
The specification is not finished yet, but several XML specifications
are already referring to this. For instance, the XLink href attribute
actually contains an IRI, not a URI.</P>

	Language</H1>
</OL>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">The word
<I>schema</I> is a generic term for a document that specifies the
layout and permissible content of a class of documents. It actually
entered computer science in the context of database schemas. For XML,
there are multiple different schema languages with their own
strengths and weaknesses including DTDs, RELAX NG, Schematron, and,
of course, the W3C XML Schema Language. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">There is a
tendency among developers to use only the word schemas, or perhaps
the only slightly less generic XML Schemas, when referring to the W3C
XML Schema Language. This needs to be resisted because the W3C XML
Schema Language is neither the only such language, nor, in most
people's opinions, the simplest, the most powerful, or the best
designed. It is merely one language promulgated by one group of
inventors. It has some good points and some bad points, but we should
not implicitly ignore all the other languages (some of which are
demonstrably simpler and/or more powerful than the W3C XML Schema
Language) by using the generic term to refer to the specific.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">Unfortunately,
the W3C has not chosen to assign its schema language an appellation
less cumbersome than &quot;W3C XML Schema Language.&quot;
Consequently, to avoid repeating this phrase incessantly, I will
occasionally succumb to temptation and use the word schemas to mean
the W3C XML Schema Language. However, I will only do this in those
chapters that discuss this language exclusively, and I will make that
very clear at the outset of the chapter. Think of the word schema as
more of a pronoun for the schema language currently being discussed
than as a proper noun for the W3C's entry into the field.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">Words have
meanings. XML is a very precisely defined language, so its words have
very precise meanings. It pays to use those words correctly. There
are indeed some confusing aspects to XML. It doesn't make sense to
make the problem worse by adding to the confusion. Using the right
words for the right concepts can simplify many unnecessarily complex
problems to save the brain power for the things that are genuinely
hard.</P>
