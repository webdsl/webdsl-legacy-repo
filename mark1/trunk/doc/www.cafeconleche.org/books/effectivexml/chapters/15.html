Build on top of structures, not syntax</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm; font-style: normal">Entity
references, CDATA sections, character references, empty-element tags
and the like are just syntax sugar. They make it a little easier to
include certain hard-to-type constructs in XML documents. They do not
in any way change a document's information content. Many parsers will
not even tell you whether such syntax sugar was used or not. Your
documents should convey the same meaning if each of these is replaced
with an equivalent representation of the same content.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm; font-style: normal">XML
processing can be thought of as a five layer stack as shown in Figure
15-1. Each layer of data is processed to generate the successively
more abstract, more useful layer that follows it. Binary data is
converted into characters. Characters are converted into syntax.
Syntax is processed to form structures. Finally structures are
interpreted to form semantics. Each layer has its place and each
layer is necessary. However, it's important not to mix them. A
program processing XML can safely operate on only a single layer.
Programs that attempt to operate in multiple layers simultaneously
risk corrupting the clean, well-formed nature of XML. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm; font-style: normal">Normally
processing begins with binary data that is translated into Unicode
text according to a particular encoding. It be necessary to decrypt,
decompress, or otherwise transform the binary data before passing it
to the parser. It may also be necessary to first strip off and
interpret metadata from the binary stream to locate the XML document.
For example when reading an XML document from a web server over a
socket, you would have to read and remove the HTTP header while
storing the information the header contained about the document's
content type and encoding. (See Item 45.) Once the beginning of the
document has been located, the parser will read ahead far enough to
detect the encoding. Once it's confident it knows the encoding, it
backs up to the beginning of the document and begins converting bytes
into Unicode characters. This may happen before the XML parser begins
its work, and is technically not a part of XML, though for
convenience most XML parsers at least have options to perform some of
this work, especially encoding detection. In Java the APIs for the
binary layer are java.io.InputStream and java.io.OutputStream.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm; font-style: normal">The
Unicode characters form the lexical layer. In Java the APIs for this
layer are java.io.Reader and java.io.Writer. These are not
specifically XML APIs because this data is not necessarily XML until
well-formedness has been verified. The only well-formedness check
that can be performed at this level is verifying that the characters
are all legal in an XML document; for example, that there are no
vertical tabs or unmatched halves of surrogate pairs in the data
stream. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm; font-style: normal">The
parser then reads the raw Unicode characters to recognize the
low-level syntax of an XML document: tags, text, entity references,
CDATA section delimiters, and so forth.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1anc" HREF="#sdfootnote1sym"><SUP>1</SUP></A>
This is the layer where most of the well-formedness rules defined by
XML's BNF grammar are checked. There are very few existing APIs that
truly expose the constructs in this layer, partially because it's not
always recognized as a separate layer and partially because few
programs really need to operate at this level, mostly just
source-code-level XML editors. However, a number of APIs have dug
holes for themselves by mixing a few pieces of this layer in with the
next higher structure layer. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm; font-style: normal">The
parser combines these low-level syntax items into higher-level
information structures: elements, attributes, text nodes, processing
instructions, and so forth. During this process, the parser checks
the XML well-formedness constraints that the XML specification calls
out separately because they cannot be encoded in the BNF grammar. The
most important of these is that each start-tag has a matching
end-tag. At this point many of the details about exactly how the
information was encoded are deliberately lost. For instance, the
parser will merge the text inside a CDATA section with the text
outside the CDATA section without in any way noting which characters
came from inside and which from outside. Most common XML APIs operate
primarily at the structure level. These include SAX, DOM, JDOM, and
XOM. Both DOM and SAX parsers can optionally mix in a lot of syntax
layer information, but neither is required to support this.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm; font-style: normal">Finally,
the parser passes the information about these high-level structures
to the client program that invoked the parser. This client program
then acts on these structures to produce semantic objects and data
structures that are appropriate for its local process. This is the
domain of data binding APIs such as JAXB, Castor and Zeus. These
attempt to completely hide the fact that the data came from XML and
treat it as some kind of programming object.</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm; font-style: normal">A
clean program that processes XML works exclusively with a single
layer. Almost  always the appropriate layer to work with is the
structure layer. In this layer, a well-designed program exclusively
processes the elements, attributes, text, and other post-parse
content. It is responsible for transforming from the structure layer
to the semantic layer. It does not involve itself with syntactic
issues such as whether a dollar sign was typed as $, &amp;#36;,
&amp;dollar;, &amp;#x24;, or even &lt;![CDATA[$]]&gt;. It has even
less interest in lexical and binary layer issues such as which
character encoding the document uses. The parser handles all of this
before the program ever sees the document. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm; font-style: normal">Note</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm; font-style: normal">There
is perhaps one exception to this rule. Source code level, generic XML
editors such as XML Spy, XED, or jEdit do need access to the syntax
layer in order to preserve the appearance of the document. For
instance, they do not want to change a named entity reference to a
numeric character reference or vice versa. They may even allow for
partially malformed documents because users may want to type content
after start-tags before they type the end-tags. Thus these tools tend
to operate on the syntax layer rather than the structure layer.
However, XML editors are a very special case in the realm of XML
software. The very unusual needs of these tools should not influence
the design of other, more conventional applications.</P>

</UL>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm; font-style: normal">Let's
explore some of the problems that commonly arise as a result of these
layer confusions.</P>
<H1 CLASS="western">Empty-Element Tags</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm; font-style: normal">Developers
trained in database theory often latch onto the empty-element tag
(e.g. &lt;para/&gt;) as a way of indicating a null value, which they
rightly consider to be distinct from 0 or the empty string. From
their perspective this makes sense. &lt;para&gt;AA&lt;/para&gt; is a
para element whose value is the string &quot;AA&quot;. &lt;para&gt;A&lt;/para&gt;
is a para element whose value is the string &quot;A&quot;.
&lt;para&gt;&lt;/para&gt; is a para element whose value is the empty
string. Finally &lt;para/&gt; is the para element whose value is
null.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm; font-style: normal">This
is all perfectly sensible, but it does not reflect the way XML
parsers actually behave. An XML parser will produce exactly the same
data from &lt;para&gt;&lt;/para&gt; as from &lt;para/&gt;. There is
no detectable difference between the two. They both have the same
value, and that value is the empty string, not null.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm; font-style: normal">The
right way to indicate a null element is by attaching an extra
attribute to the element. In particular the W3C XML Schema Language
defines an attribute for exactly this purpose, xsi:nil. The customary
xsi prefix is mapped to the namespace URL
http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance, and as always the prefix
can change as long as the URL stays the same. For example, this para
element genuinely has a null value:</P>
<PRE CLASS="western">&lt;para xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot; 
      xsi:nil=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;</PRE><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm; font-style: normal">
A schema aware parser may actually report the value of this element
as being null. However it's more likely you'll have to explicitly
test each empty element for the presence of an xsi:nil attribute. For
example, in DOM to convert an Element object known to be empty to a
string, you might write code something like this:</P>
<PRE CLASS="western">String elementText;
String isNil = element.getAttributeNS(
 &quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;, nil);
if (&quot;true&quot;.equals(isNil)) {
 elementText = null;
}
else {  // either there is no xsi:nil attribute or its value is false
  elementText = &quot;&quot;;
}</PRE><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm; font-style: normal">
It is an error to set xsi:nil=&quot;true&quot; on a non-empty
element. However, the difference between two tags and one is not
important. This para element is also nil:</P>
<PRE CLASS="western">&lt;para xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot; 
      xsi:nil=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/para&gt;</PRE><H1 CLASS="western">
CDATA Sections</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm; font-style: normal">CDATA
sections are probably the most frequently abused drugs in the XML
pharmacy. The normal reason for this abuse is to embed
non-well-formed HTML inside an XML document. For example, the
description element in a catalog entry might contain an entire web
page for a product:</P>
<PRE CLASS="western">&lt;Vehicle&gt;
  &lt;price&gt;30000&lt;/price&gt;
  &lt;inStock&gt;4&lt;/inStock&gt;

&lt;/Vehicle&gt;</PRE><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm; font-style: normal">
Given this structure, it's temptingly easy to write code that
extracts the contents of the description element and writes the raw
text into a file or onto a network socket that expects to receive
HTML. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm; font-style: normal">Even
worse is the case where the CDATA section is not the exclusive
contents of an element, but is instead one of several children, so
that it becomes almost a pseudo-element. For example, imagine that
the above catalog entry did not contain a separate description
element child, just a CDATA section holding HTML:</P>

This sort of structure causes major problems for all sorts of XML
tools. It severely limits the validation that can be performed with a
DTD or a schema. It is extremely difficult to transform properly with
XSLT. DOM parsers may or may not separate out the CDATA sections from
the surrounding text, and SAX parsers might not even notice the CDATA
sections.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm; font-style: normal">The

&lt;/Vehicle&gt;</PRE><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm; font-style: normal">
If you want to get the text from the HTML, you'll have to serialize
the root html element, just like you'd serialize any other XML
element. In DOM3 you can use the DOMWriter class.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm; font-style: normal">The
general rule for CDATA sections is that nothing should change if the
CDATA section is replaced by its content text with all &lt; and &amp;'s
suitably escaped. CDATA sections are meant as a convenience for human
authors, especially ones writing books about markup like the one you
hold in your hands right now. They are not meant to replace elements
for indicating the structure and semantics of content or as a means
of hiding malformed markup inside an XML document.</P>
<H1 CLASS="western">Character and Entity References</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm; font-style: normal">Entity
and character references are also often abused. Many XML parser APIs
sometimes let you see which entity any given character came from
(though not all do, and in SAX and DOM this ability is not
implemented by all parsers). However you shouldn't rely on this, and
no parsers will tell you whether each character came from raw text or
a character reference. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm; font-style: normal">The
classic example of what not to do here is mix XML's escaping
mechanisms with your application's escaping mechanism. For instance,
an application could specify that a string of text beginning with a
literal dollar sign ($, Unicode character 36) is a variable
reference. For example, this Para element includes a variable
reference:</P>
<PRE CLASS="western">&lt;Para&gt;Hello $name&lt;/Para&gt;</PRE><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm; font-style: normal">
This is fine. However, it does require some means to escape the
dollar sign when it's used as just a dollar sign. I've occasionally
seen applications that attempt to use XML character references for
such escaping. For example, this would not be a variable reference:</P>
<PRE CLASS="western">&lt;Para&gt;Hello &amp;#36;name&lt;/Para&gt;</PRE><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm; font-style: normal">
This is a bad design that makes it impossible to parse these
documents correctly with standard APIs like SAX and DOM or standard
parsers like Crimson and &AElig;lfred because they won't distinguish
between a literal $ and &amp;#36;. Instead a custom parser is
required. This makes development much harder than it needs to be. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm; font-style: normal">The
mistake is tying application level semantics (how to tell what's a
variable and what isn't) to syntactic aspects of the document that
the parser hides. The correct approach is to define a new escaping
mechanism that's visible above the XML parser layer instead of below
it. For example, you could declare that all variables begin with a $,
whichever way that character was typed. However, a double dollar sign
would be converted to a single plain text dollar sign. For example,
these Para elements would both contain a variable reference:</P>
<PRE CLASS="western">&lt;Para&gt;Hello $name&lt;/Para&gt;
&lt;Para&gt;Hello &amp;#36;name&lt;/Para&gt;</PRE><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm; font-style: normal">
However, these two would not:</P>
<PRE CLASS="western">&lt;Para&gt;Hello $$name&lt;/Para&gt;
&lt;Para&gt;Hello &amp;#36;&amp;#36;name&lt;/Para&gt;</PRE><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm; font-style: normal">
Design your processing software and XML applications so that they
only depend on those aspects of XML that parsers reliably report:
element boundaries, text content, attribute values, and processing
instructions. Do not write markup that depends on syntax that the
parser may resolve before reporting to the client application: CDATA
sections, entity references, attribute order, character references,
comments, whether attributes are defaulted from the DTD or included
in the instance document, etc. You may indeed be able to write
software that supports such lower level syntax using one particular
parser or API. However, you won't be able to validate it with
standard schema languages, and I guarantee that you'll confuse
document authors who won't always follow your rules. Worst of all,
many and perhaps most XML parsers and APIs won't be able to fully
process  your documents, even if you can. Build applications on top
of the structure layer, and let the parser do the hard work of
sorting out the syntax.
