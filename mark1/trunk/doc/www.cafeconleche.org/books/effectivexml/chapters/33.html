<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">While SAX
programs are almost always faster and more memory efficient than the
DOM equivalents, performance is not a god to be worshiped above all
others. There are many times when using DOM makes sense. In
particular, for many classes of applications, programmers will find
DOM much easier to work with. If shaving off 10% of execution time or
90% of space matters less to you than saving 10% of development time,
then you need to consider whether DOM might better fit the problem at
hand than SAX.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">In
particular, the following characteristics indicate that a problem
might be profitably addressed by DOM:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">The
	documents are small relative to the available memory; roughly 10% of
	the heap size or less.</P>
	<LI><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">Processing
	requires random access to widely separated parts of the tree. For
	instance, you need access to the last elements in the document
	before you can figure out what to do with the first elements.</P>
	<LI><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">The
	program needs to navigate backwards and up in the tree, as well as
	forwards and down.</P>
	<LI><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">The
	program needs to access all the data in the document, not just a
	subset of it. The program's own data structures essentially
	reproduce the complexity of the XML document. 
	</P>
	<LI><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">The
	developers find working with a tree structure to be easier and more
	natural than working with an event sequence.</P>
	<LI><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">The
	program has to be portable across languages. (I can't honestly say
	I've ever encountered this requirement in practice, but this need
	explains a lot of the weirdness in DOM.)</P>
</UL>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">All of
these are fuzzy. If speed matters more to you than product
development time or memory usage, you may choose to use SAX even for
a system that uses data structures as complex as the XML document
itself and requires random access to the tree. The only criterion
that's really carved in stone is memory. If the program needs to
process documents that are large compared to the available memory,
then you really have to use a streaming API such as SAX. Otherwise, a
lot depends on your comfort level and the need for each
characteristic.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">If my
recommendation for DOM sounds a lot more reticent than that for SAX,
there's a good reason. DOM can be just plain weird. It is very much
like the proverbial horse designed by committee, and, to be perfectly
honest, camels don't smell as bad as DOM. DOM is packed with gotchas.
Here's a representative sampling of just a few:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">DOM
	requires code to specify namespace URIs when creating new Element
	and Attr objects, and to add xmlns and xmlns:prefix attributes to
	elements where necessary. This is not an either/or. You must do them
	both, and DOM makes no efforts to make sure they don't accidentally
	conflict with each other.</P>
	<LI><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">Nodes
	cannot be moved from one document to another.</P>
	<LI><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">There
	are separate methods to add an Attr object to an Element object
	depending on whether or not the attribute is in a namespace.</P>
	<LI><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">Every
	node class has a getValue() method, but more often than not this
	just returns null.</P>
	<LI><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">Every
	node has a namespaceURI and localName properties, even ones like
	comments and text nodes that have neither names nor namespace URIs.</P>
	<LI><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">Types
	are represented by integer constants rather than by classes.</P>
	<LI><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">The
	document type declaration can only be set when the document is
	created, and from thereon after is read-only.</P>
</UL>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">I could go
on--I haven't even begun to consider issues like naming conventions
and the use of short constants that may make sense to programmers in
some languages but not others--but I'll restrain myself. DOM is such
an incredibly baroque API that most experienced XML developers turn
to it only as a last resort.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">Most of
the reasons to use DOM are really reasons to use a tree-based API
that holds the document in memory. There's no particular reason this
has to be DOM instead of JDOM, XOM, dom4j, or any of the numerous
other tree-based APIs. Microsoft implements DOM in MSXML, but has
added so many additional non-standard methods that the resulting API
really isn't DOM at all. Indeed the proliferation of alternate
tree-based object models for XML is a symptom of the widespread
dissatisfaction with DOM in the developer community. By way of
contrast, the much cleaner SAX API has the field of push parsing XML
almost completely to itself. There are a few rough spots in SAX, but
not of them have itched developers enough to make them replace it. By
contrast, DOM itches developers worse than the fleas of a thousand
camels.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">Considered
relative to other tree-based APIs, where does DOM stand out? I've
talked about its unique weaknesses. What, if any, are its unique
strengths? Believe it or not, there are a few that occasionally
suggest or even mandate its use:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">You
	want the option to change implementations to find the one that
	performs best on your workload. DOM is the only tree-based API that
	is independently implemented by many vendors.</P>
	<LI><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">You
	need to interface with APIs and libraries that expect to receive DOM
	objects. DOM predates all the efforts to replace it, so it is much
	more broadly supported than alternative APIs.</P>
	<LI><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">Company
	rules, government regulations, or contractual obligations require
	you to use standard APIs where available. DOM is a W3C
	recommendation. None of the competing APIs are any form of ISO,
	OASIS, IETF, IEEE, or W3C standard. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">In brief,
DOM is more standard and more broadly supported than other APIs; and
thus may be important in situations where you need to exchange code
with diverse programmers. However, it is not the cleanest, most
efficient, fastest, or most productive API you can use to process
XML.</P>
