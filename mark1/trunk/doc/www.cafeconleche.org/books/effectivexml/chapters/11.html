Make structure explicit through markup</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in">All
structure in an XML document should be indicated through XML tags,
not through other means. XML parsers are designed to process tags.
They do not see any other form of structure in the data, explicit or
implicit. Using anything except tags and their attributes to
delineate structure makes the data much harder to read. In essence,
programmers who write software to process such documents must invent
mini-parsers for the non-XML structures in the data. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in">For
example, in the bank statement XML application, a transaction could
theoretically be represented like this:</P>
<PRE LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">&lt;Transaction&gt;Withdrawal 2003 12 15 200.00&lt;/Transaction&gt;</PRE><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in">
This would require applications reading the data to know that the
first field is the kind of transaction, the second field is the year,
the third is the month, the fourth is the date, an the last is the
amount. In most cases a client application would have to split this
data along the white space to further process it. On the other hand,
the client application has less work to do and can operate more
smoothly if it's presented with data marked up like this:</P>
<PRE LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">&lt;Transaction type=&quot;withdrawal&quot;&gt;
  <SPAN LANG="en-US">&lt;Date&gt;2003-12-15&lt;/Date&gt;</SPAN>
  <SPAN LANG="en-US">&lt;Amount&gt;200.00&lt;/Amount&gt;</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">&lt;/Transaction&gt;</SPAN></PRE><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in">
Here each useful unit of information can be seen as the complete
content of an element or an attribute. 
</P>
<OL>
	<LI><H1 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-after: avoid">
	Tag Each Unit of Information</H1>
</OL>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in">The key
idea is that what's between two tags should be the minimum unit of
text that can usefully be processed as a whole. It should not need to
be further subdivided for the common use-cases. An Amount element
contains a complete amount, and nothing else. The amount is a single
thing, a whole unit of information, in this case a number. It does
not have internal structure that any application is likely to care
about.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in">Occasionally
the question of what constitutes a unit may depend on where and how
the data is used. For example, consider the Date element in the above
Transaction. It contains implicit markup based on the hyphen. It
could instead be written like this:</P>
<PRE LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">&lt;Date&gt;
  <SPAN LANG="en-US">&lt;Year&gt;2003&lt;Year&gt;</SPAN>
  <SPAN LANG="en-US">&lt;Month&gt;12&lt;/Month&gt;</SPAN>
  <SPAN LANG="en-US">&lt;Day&gt;15&lt;/Day&gt;</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">&lt;/Date&gt;</SPAN></PRE><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in">
Whether this is useful or not depends on how the dates will be used.
If they're merely formatted on a page as is, or passed to an API that
knows how to create Date objects from strings like 2003-12-15 then
you may not need to separate out the month, day, and year as separate
elements. Generally, whether to further subdivide data depends on the
use to which the information is put and the operations that will be
performed on it. If dates are intended purely to notate a particular
moment in history, then a format like &lt;Date&gt;2003-12-15&lt;/Date&gt;
is appropriate. This would be useful for figuring out if it's time to
drink a bottle of wine, determining whether a worker is eligible for
retirement benefits, or calculating how much time remains on a car's
warranty, for example. In none of these cases is the individual day
of month, month, or even year very significant. Only the combination
of these quantities matters. That dates are even divided into these
quantities in the first place in mostly a fluke of astronomy and the
planet we live on, not something intrinsic to the nature of time.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in">On the
other hand, consider weather data. Since weather varies with the
seasons and has a roughly periodic structure tied to the years and
the months, it does make sense to compare weather from one February
to the next, without necessarily considering the year. Other real
world data tied to annual and monthly cycles includes birthdays, pay
periods, and financial results. If you're modeling this sort of data
you will want to be able to separate months, days, and years from
each other. In this case, more structured markup such as
&lt;date&gt;&lt;year&gt;2003&lt;/year&gt;&lt;month&gt;12&lt;/month&gt;&lt;day&gt;15&lt;/day&gt;&lt;/date&gt;
is appropriate. The question is really whether processes manipulating
this data are likely to want to treat the text as a single unit of
information or a composite of more fundamental data.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in">On the
other hand, just because you don't need to extract the individual
components of a date does not mean that no one who works with the
data will need to do that. Generally, I prefer to err on the side of
too much markup rather than too little. Larger chunks of data can
normally be formed by manipulating the parent or ancestor elements
when necessary. It is easier to remove structure when processing than
to add it.  
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in">The
classic example of what not to do is Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG).
SVG uses huge amounts of non-XML based mark-up. For example, consider
this polygon element:</P>
<PRE LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">&lt;polygon points=&quot;350,75 379,161 469,161 397,215 423,301 
                 <SPAN LANG="en-US">350,250 277,301 303,215 231,161 321,161&quot; /&gt;</SPAN></PRE><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in">
In particular, look at the value of the points attribute. That's not
just a string of characters. Instead it's a sequence of x, y
coordinates. An SVG processor cannot simply work with the attribute
value. Instead it first has to divide the attribute value into
matching pairs and decide which are x's and which are y's. The proper
approach would have been to define the coordinates as child elements,
like this:</P>
<PRE LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">&lt;polygon&gt;
  <SPAN LANG="en-US">&lt;point x=&quot;350&quot; y=&quot;75&quot;/&gt; </SPAN>
  <SPAN LANG="en-US">&lt;point x=&quot;379&quot; y=&quot;161&quot;/&gt; </SPAN>
  <SPAN LANG="en-US">&lt;point x=&quot;469&quot; y=&quot;161&quot;/&gt; </SPAN>
  <SPAN LANG="en-US">&lt;point x=&quot;397&quot; y=&quot;215&quot;/&gt; </SPAN>
  <SPAN LANG="en-US">&lt;point x=&quot;423&quot; y=&quot;301&quot;/&gt; </SPAN>
  <SPAN LANG="en-US">&lt;point x=&quot;350&quot; y=&quot;250&quot;/&gt; </SPAN>
  <SPAN LANG="en-US">&lt;point x=&quot;277&quot; y=&quot;301&quot;/&gt; </SPAN>
  <SPAN LANG="en-US">&lt;point x=&quot;303&quot; y=&quot;215&quot;/&gt; </SPAN>
  <SPAN LANG="en-US">&lt;point x=&quot;231&quot; y=&quot;161&quot;/&gt; </SPAN>
  <SPAN LANG="en-US">&lt;point x=&quot;321&quot; y=&quot;161&quot;/&gt; </SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">&lt;/polygon&gt;</SPAN></PRE><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in">
This way the XML processor would present the coordinates to the
application already nicely parsed. This also demonstrates the
important point that attributes don't support structure very well
(See Item 12). Structured data normally needs to be stored in element
hierarchies. Only the lowest, most unstructured pieces should be put
in attributes. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in">The
reasoning behind this bad decision was to avoid excessive file-size
and verbosity. However, terseness of markup is an explicit non-goal
of XML. If you really care that much about how many characters a user
must type, you shouldn't be using XML in the first place. In this
case, however, terseness truly has no benefits. Almost all practical
SVG is either generated by a computer program or drawn in a WYSIWYG
application such as Adobe Illustrator. Software can easily handle a
more verbose, pure XML format. Indeed, it would be considerably
easier to write such SVG-processing and generating software if all
the structures were based on XML. File size is even less important.
SVG documents are routinely gzipped in practice anyway, which rapidly
eliminates any significant differences between the less and more
verbose formats. (See Item 53, Compress if space is  a problem).</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in">SVG goes
even further in the wrong direction by incorporating the non-XML CSS
format. For example, a polygon can be filled, stroked and colored
like this:</P>
<PRE LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">&lt;polygon style=&quot;fill: red; stroke: blue; stroke-width: 10&quot; 
         <SPAN LANG="en-US">points=&quot;350,75 379,161 469,161 397,215 423,301 </SPAN>
                 <SPAN LANG="en-US">350,250 277,301 303,215 231,161 321,161&quot; /&gt;</SPAN></PRE><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in">
Fortunately for the most important and common styles, SVG also allows
an attribute based alternative. For example, this is an equivalent
polygon:</P>
<PRE LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">&lt;polygon fill=&quot;red&quot; stroke=&quot;blue&quot; stroke-width=&quot;10&quot; 
         <SPAN LANG="en-US">points=&quot;350,75 379,161 469,161 397,215 423,301 </SPAN>
                 <SPAN LANG="en-US">350,250 277,301 303,215 231,161 321,161&quot; /&gt;</SPAN></PRE><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in">
Nonetheless, because the CSS style attribute is allowed, an SVG
renderer needs both an XML parser and a CSS parser. It's easier to
write a CSS parser than an XML parser, but it's still a non-trivial
amount of work. Furthermore, it's much harder to detect violations of
CSS. Its less draconian error handling makes it easier to produce
incorrect SVG documents that may not be noticed by authors. SVG is
less interoperable and reliable than it would be if it were pure XML.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in">XSL
Formatting Objects (XSL-FO), by contrast, is an example of how to
properly integrate XML formats with legacy formats such as CSS. It
maintains the CSS property names, values, and meanings. However, it
replaces CSS's native structure with an XML equivalent. XSL-FO
doesn't have polygons, but here's a paragraph whose  color is blue,
whose background color is red, and whose border is ten pixels wide:</P>
<PRE LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">&lt;fo:block color=&quot;blue&quot; background-color=&quot;red&quot; border=&quot;10px&quot;&gt;
  <SPAN LANG="en-US">The text of the paragraph goes here.</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">&lt;/fo:block&gt;</SPAN></PRE><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in">
This has all the advantages of familiarity with CSS but none of the
disadvantages of non-XML structure. The semantics of CSS are retained
while the syntax is changed to more convenient XML.</P>

	Avoid Implicit Structure</H1>
</OL>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in">You need
to be especially wary of implicit markup, often indicated by white
space. For example, consider the simple case of a name:</P>
<PRE LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">&lt;Name&gt;Lenny Bruce&lt;/Name&gt;</PRE><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in">
The name is sometimes treated as a single thing, but quite often you
need to extract the first name and last name separately, most
commonly to sort by last name. This seems easy enough to do: just
split the string on the white space. The first name is everything
before the space. The last name is everything after the space. Of
course this algorithm falls apart as soon as you add middle names:</P>
<PRE LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">&lt;Name&gt;Lenny Alfred Bruce&lt;/Name&gt;</PRE><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in">
You may decide that you don't really care about middle names, that
they can just be appended to the first name. You're just going to
sort by last name anyway. However, now consider what happens when the
last name contains white space:</P>
<PRE LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">&lt;Name&gt;Stefania de Kennessey&lt;/Name&gt;</PRE><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in">
The obvious algorithm assigns people the wrong last name. This can be
quite offensive to the person whose name you've butchered, not that I
haven't seen a lot of na&iuml;ve software that does exactly this. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in">What about
titles? For example, consider these names:</P>
<PRE LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">&lt;Name&gt;Mr. Lenny Bruce&lt;/Name&gt;
<SPAN LANG="en-US">&lt;Name&gt;Dr. Benjamin Spock&lt;/Name&gt;</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">&lt;Name&gt;Timothy Leary, PhD&lt;/Name&gt;</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">&lt;Name&gt;William Kunstler, Esq.&lt;/Name&gt;</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">&lt;Name&gt;Ms. Anita Hoffman&lt;/Name&gt;</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">&lt;Name&gt;Prof. John H. Exton, M.D., PhD&lt;/Name&gt;</SPAN></PRE><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in">
Given a large list of likely titles you can probably design an
algorithm that accounts for these, but what seemed like a simple
operation is rapidly complexifying in the face of real-world data. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in">Finally,
let's recall that not all cultures put the family name last. For
example, in Japan the family name normally comes first:</P>
<PRE LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">&lt;Name&gt;Kawabata Yasunari&lt;/Name&gt;</PRE><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in">
Thus when sorting Japanese names you sort by first name rather than
last name. Do you really want to try to design a system that can
guess whether a string is a Japanese name or an English one? To make
matters worse, often, but not always, when Japanese names are
translated into English the order of the names is reversed:</P>
<PRE LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">&lt;Name&gt;Yasunari Kawabata&lt;/Name&gt;</PRE><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in">
In fact, Japanese written in Kanji normally doesn't even use white
space between the family and given name:</P>
<PRE LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">&lt;Name&gt;<SPAN LANG=""><FONT FACE="MS Mincho, Times, serif"><FONT COLOR="#000080">川端康成</FONT></FONT></SPAN>&lt;/Name&gt;</PRE><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in">
The problem is a lot messier than it looks at first glance.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in">All of
this goes away as soon as you use explicit markup to identify the
different components of a name, instead of relying on software to
sort it out:</P>
<PRE LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">&lt;Name&gt;&lt;Given&gt;Lenny&lt;/Given&gt; &lt;Family&gt;Bruce&lt;/Family&gt;&lt;/Name&gt;
<SPAN LANG="en-US">&lt;Name&gt;&lt;Given&gt;Lenny&lt;/Given&gt; &lt;Middle&gt;Alfred&lt;/Middle&gt; &lt;Family&gt;Bruce&lt;/Family&gt;&lt;/Name&gt;</SPAN>

Another example of abuse of white space occurs in narrative documents
that attempt to treat white space as significant, as in this poem:</P>

Here the line breaks indicate the end of a verse, and the blank lines
indicate the end of a stanza. However, this can be problematic when
the content is displayed in an environment where the lines are
wrapped or the white space is otherwise adjusted for typographical
reasons. Furthermore, these white space based constraints can't be
validated, either with respect to XML (Every stanza contains one or
more verses) or poetry (the first stanza of a sonnet has eight
verses; the second has six). Authors are likely to make mistakes when
the white space is too significant. It's much better to make the
stanza and verse division explicit like this:</P>

source code, whether in Python or in other languages, is a special
case. It has a huge amount of structure that just does not lend
itself to expression in XML. Furthermore parsers for this structure
exist and are as common and useful as parsers for XML. (They're
generally bundled as parts of compilers.) Most importantly, there are
only two normal uses for source code embedded in XML documents:</P>

Obviously, this is going too far. It would be far more troublesome to
process than a simple, unmarked up number. After all, almost everyone
who wants to use a number treats it as an atomic quantity rather than
a composition of four single digits. However, this does suggest a
good rule of thumb for where to stop inserting tags. Anything that
will normally be treated as a single atomic value should not be
further divided by mark up. However, if a value is composed of
smaller parts that will need to be addressed individually, they
should be marked up.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in">Here are a
few other common edge cases, and my thoughts on why I would or
wouldn't further divide them:</P>
<DL>
	<DT LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Numbers with units such as 7px,
	8.5kg, or 108db</DT><DD LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">
	Neither the unit nor the number means anything in isolation. It
	doesn't help much to know that a mass is denoted in kilograms
	without knowing how many kilograms. Similarly, there's not much
	point to knowing that the mass is 3.2 if you don't know whether
	that's 3.2 grams, 3.2 kilograms, or 3.2 metric tons. Thus I prefer
	to write such quantities as &lt;mass&gt;7.5kg&lt;/mass&gt; and
	&lt;speed&gt;32mph&lt;/speed&gt;.</DD><DT LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">
	Time</DT><DD LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">
	The division of time into hours, minutes, and seconds is very
	similar to the date case. Indeed a date is just a somewhat more
	coarsely grained measure of time, and times can be appended to dates
	to more precisely identify a moment. However, <I>durations</I> of
	time are a different story. These include quantities such as the
	flight time from San Jose to New York<SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">
	or the number of minutes that can be recorded on a video tape in SP
	mode</SPAN>. Here's it is the total time that matters, not the
	beginning point and end point. The division of time into 24 hours
	per day, 60 minutes per hour, and 60 seconds per minute is a
	historical relic of Babylonian astronomy and their base-60 number
	system, not anything fundamentally related to natural quantities, a
	point which is proved by the fact that durations can be flattened to
	a total number of minutes or seconds rather than using three
	different units. Thus I tend to treat a duration as a single
	quantity and write it using a form like &lt;FlightTime&gt;6h32m&lt;/
	FlightTime&gt; instead of a more structured form such as
	&lt;FlightTime&gt;&lt;hours&gt;6&lt;/hours&gt;&lt;minutes&gt;32&lt;/minutes&gt;&lt;/
	FlightTime&gt;. 
	</DD><DT LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">
	Lists</DT><DD LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">
	Both DTDs and schemas define list data types that can describe
	content separated by white space. In DTDs, these include attributes
	declared to have type IDREFS and ENTITIES. In schemas this includes
	any element or attribute declared with a list type. I really don't
	like this. This may be the only way to store plural quantities such
	as a list of entities or numbers in attributes. However, when faced
	with potentially plural things I prefer to use child elements.
	Overuse of attributes leads to markup that's hard to manage.</DD><DT LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">
	URLs</DT><DD LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">
	A URL (or URI) has a lot of internal structure. For instance, the
	URL
	http://www.cafeconleche.org:80/books/xmljava/chapters/ch09s07.html#d0e15480
	has a protocol, a host (which itself has a host name, a domain name,
	and a top-level domain), a port, a file path, and a fragment
	identifier. Theoretically, you could mark this up like so:</DD></DL>
<PRE LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">&lt;url&gt;
  <SPAN LANG="en-US">&lt;protocol&gt;http&lt;/protocol&gt;</SPAN>
  <SPAN LANG="en-US">&lt;host&gt;www.cafeconleche.org&lt;/host&gt;</SPAN>
  <SPAN LANG="en-US">&lt;port&gt;80&lt;/port&gt;</SPAN>
  <SPAN LANG="en-US">&lt;file&gt;/books/xmljava/chapters/ch09s07.html&lt;/file&gt;</SPAN>
  <SPAN LANG="en-US">&lt;fragment&gt;d0e15480&lt;/fragment&gt;</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">&lt;/url&gt;</SPAN></PRE>

	<DD LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">
	However, in practice this is almost never done, and with good
	reason. Almost every use of a URL, from passing it to a method in a
	programming API to copying it and pasting into the browser location
	bar to painting it on the side of a building, expects to receive an
	entire URL, not a piece of one. In those rare cases where you need
	to divide a URL into its component parts, most APIs provide adequate
	support. Thus it's best not to subdivide the URL beyond what
	everyone expects.</DD><DT LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">
	In general, however, if I suspect that an element might usefully be
	further divided, I will divide it. XML has the opposite of the
	Humpty-Dumpty problem: it's much easier to put the pieces back
	together again when content is split by tags than it is to break it
	apart when there aren't enough tags. Having too much markup in your
	data is rarely a practical problem. Having too little markup is much
	more cumbersome.</DT></DL>
