<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=5><B>1.
Include an XML declaration</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">Although XML
declarations are optional, every XML document should have one. An XML
declaration helps both human users and automated software identify
the document as XML. It identifies the version of XML in use,
specifies the character encoding, and can even help optimize the
parsing. Most importantly, it's a crucial clue that what you're
reading is in fact an XML document in environments where file type
information is unavailable or unreliable.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">The following are all
legal XML declarations:</P>
<PRE>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;ISO-8859-1&quot; standalone=&quot;no&quot;?&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; standalone=&quot;yes&quot;?&gt;</PRE><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">
The XML declaration must be the first thing in the XML document. It
cannot be preceded by any comments, processing instruction, or even
white space. The only thing that may sometimes  precede it is the
optional byte order mark.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">The XML declaration is
not a processing instruction, even though it looks like one. If
you're processing an XML document through APIs like SAX, DOM, or
JDOM, then the method calls you use to read and write the XML
declaration will not be the same as the method calls you use to read
and write processing instructions. In many cases, including SAX2,
DOM2, XOM, and JDOM, the information from the XML declaration may not
be available at all. The parser will use it to determine how to read
a document, but it will not report it to the client application.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">Each XML declaration
has up to three attributes:</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">version</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">The version of XML in
use. Currently this always has the value 1.0, though there may be an
XML 1.1 in the future. (See Item 3)</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">encoding</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">The character set in
which the document is written.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">standalone</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">Whether or not the
external DTD subset makes important contributions to the document's
infoset. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">Like other attributes,
these may be enclosed in single or double quotes, and any amount of
white space may separate them from each other. Unlike other
attributes, order matters. The version must always come before the
encoding which must always come before the standalone declaration.
The version is required. The encoding and standalone declaration are
optional.</P>
<H1 CLASS="western">Version</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">The version attribute
always has the value 1.0. If XML 1.1 is released in the future (and
it may not be) then this will probably also be allowed to have the
value 1.1. Regardless, you should always use 1.0, never 1.1. 1.0 is
more compatible, more robust, and offers all the features XML 1.1
does. Item 3 discusses this in more detail.</P>
<H1 CLASS="western">Encoding</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">The encoding
declaration specifies which character set and encoding the document
is written in. Sometimes this identifies an encoding of the Unicode
character set such as UTF-8 and UTF-16, and other times it identifies
a different character set such as ISO-8859-1 or US-ASCII, which for
XML's purposes serves mainly as an encoding of a subset of the full
Unicode character set.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">The default encoding is
UTF-8 if no encoding declaration or other metadata is present. UTF-16
can also be used if the document begins with a byte order mark.
However, even in cases where the document is written in the UTF-8 or
UTF-16 encodings, an encoding declaration helps people reading the
document recognize the encoding, so it's useful to specify it
explicitly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">Try to stick to
well-known standard character sets and encodings if possible such as
ISO-8859-1, UTF-8, and UTF-16. You should always use the standard
names for these character sets. Table 1-1 lists the names defined by
the XML 1.0 specification. All parsers that support these character
sets should recognize these names. For character encodings not
defined in XML 1.0, choose a name registered with the IANA. You can
find a complete list at
http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets/. However, you should
avoid non-standard names. In particular watch out for Java names like
8859_1 and UTF16. Relatively few parsers not written in Java
recognize these, and even some Java parsers don't recognize them by
default. However, all parsers including those written in Java should
recognize the IANA standard equivalents like ISO-8859-1 and UTF-16.</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">For similar reasons,
avoid declaring and using vendor-dependent character sets such as
Cp1252 (U.S. Windows) or MacRoman. These are not as interoperable
across the heterogeneous set of platforms XML supports as the
standard character sets.</P>
<H1 CLASS="western">The Standalone Declaration</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">The standalone
declaration has the value yes or no. If no standalone declaration is
present, then no is the default.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">A yes value means that
no declarations in the external DTD subset affect the content of the
document in any way. Specifically:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">No default
	attribute values are specified for elements 
	</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">No entity
	references used in the instance document are defined 
	</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">No attribute
	values need to be normalized</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">No elements
	contain ignorable white space.</P>
</UL>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">If these conditions
hold, then the parser may choose not to read the external DTD subset,
which can save a significant amount of time when the DTD is at a
remote and slow web site.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">A non-validating parser
will not actually check that these conditions hold. For example, it
will not report an error if an element does not have an attribute for
which a default value is provided in the external DTD subset.
Obviously the parser can't find mistakes that are only apparent when
it reads the external DTD subset if it doesn't read the external DTD
subset. A validating parser is supposed to report a validity error if
standalone has the value yes and any of these four conditions are not
true. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">It is always acceptable
to set standalone to no, even if the document could technically stand
alone. If you don't want to be bothered figuring out whether all of
the above four conditions apply, just set standalone=&rdquo;no&rdquo;
(or leave it unspecified because the default is no). This is always
correct.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">The standalone
declaration only applies to content read from the external DTD
subset. It has nothing to do with other means of merging in content
from remote documents such as schemas, XIncludes, XLinks, application
specific markup like the img element in XHTML, or anything else. It
is strictly about the DTD.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">Whatever values you
pick for the version, encoding, and standalone attributes, and
whether you include encoding and standalone attributes at all, you
should provide an XML declaration. It only takes a few bytes, and
makes it much easier for both people and parsers to process your
document.</P>
