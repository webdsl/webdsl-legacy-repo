Catalog Common Resources</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">Many XML
processes use system IDs (in practice URLs) to locate the standard
DTDs, schemas, style sheets, and other supporting files for
applications like DocBook, XHTML, and SVG. However, this can put
quite a load on the central server and means your application may
have to wait on a potentially slow remote server you don't control.
You might not even be able to process your documents when the central
(which you don't have any control over) is down to hardware failure,
a system crash, or network outages. Alternately you can use XML
catalogs to remap public IDs and URLs. A catalog can convert  public
IDs like -//OASIS//DTD DocBook XML V4.2//EN into absolute URLs like
http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/4.2/docbookx.dtd. It can
replace remote URLs like 
http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/4.2/docbookx.dtd with local
URLs like file:///home/elharo/docbook/docbookx.dtd. This offers fast,
reliable access to the DTDs and schemas without making the documents
less portable across systems and networks.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">Catalogs
provide the extra level of indirection that makes XML processing much
more flexible. They allow URNs (Uniform Resource Names) to be used
just as easily as URLs. Even if you're only using URLs, they allow
documents to be much more easily moved between systems. For instance,
when I move the text of my manuscripts from my Linux desktop to my
Windows laptop, I can change the location of the DTD just by editing
one catalog file. I don't have to edit every chapter document
separately to tell the XML parser and the XSLT processor where to
find the right DTD.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">Of course,
not all requests have to (or should) go through a catalog. If the
catalog doesn't have an entry for a particular public ID or URL, then
the parser can fall back to the original remote URL. For instance, it
could load the XHTML DTD from the W3C web site. However, it only
needs to make a network connection if the resource isn't available
locally. This saves both processing time and network bandwidth. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">You can
even use catalogs to choose different stylesheets or schemas
depending on your needs. For instance, by editing the catalog, you
can test several different possible schemas or style sheets to see
which one you prefer. You might even choose between a style sheet
that generates HTML and one that generates XHTML.

	Catalog Syntax</H1>
</OL>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">A catalog
is just an XML document in the syntax defined by the OASIS XML
Catalogs standard
(http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/entity/spec-2001-08-06.html).
The root element of this document is catalog which is in the
urn:oasis:names:tc:entity:xmlns:xml:catalog namespace. The catalog
element contains public elements that remap PUBLIC IDs and system
elements that remap SYSTEM IDs. Example 47-1 shows a simple catalog
that maps the public ID for DocBook to a file in the local file
system:</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">Example
47-1: A catalog document</P>
<PRE LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
<SPAN LANG="en-US">&lt;catalog xmlns=&quot;urn:oasis:names:tc:entity:xmlns:xml:catalog&quot;&gt;</SPAN>

<SPAN LANG="en-US">  &lt;public publicId=&quot;-//OASIS//DTD DocBook XML V4.2//EN&quot;</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">          uri=&quot;file:///usr/local/xml/docbook/docbookx.dtd&quot;/&gt;</SPAN>

<SPAN LANG="en-US">&lt;/catalog&gt;</SPAN></PRE><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">
The public element maps the public ID -//OASIS//DTD DocBook XML
V4.2.0//EN to the local URL 
file:///usr/local/xml/docbook/docbookx.dtd. The beginning of each
chapter has this document type declaration:</P>
<PRE LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">&lt;!DOCTYPE chapter PUBLIC &quot;-//OASIS//DTD DocBook XML V4.2//EN&quot; 
<SPAN LANG="en-US">     &quot;http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/4.2/docbookx.dtd&quot;&gt;</SPAN></PRE><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">
Its system ID points to the remote DTD on the OASIS web site.
However, that won't be used. The parser looks for the public ID in
the local catalog.xml file. When it finds it, it uses the URL from
the catalog instead of the one in the document itself. However, if
the catalog doesn't contain a mapping for the public ID, then it will
use the URL included in the document itself.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">As well as
public IDs, you can remap system IDs. This is useful for loading
content that doesn't have a public ID, such as stylesheets referenced
by an xml-stylesheet processing instruction or multiple source
documents loaded by the document() function in XSLT.  This is done
with the system element. For example, this system element remaps the
DocBook XSL stylesheet at Sourceforge to a local copy stored in
/usr/local/xml/docbook-xsl/:</P>
<PRE LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">&lt;system systemId=
<SPAN LANG="en-US">  &quot;http://docbook.sourceforge.net/release/xsl/current/html/docbook.xsl&quot; </SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">   uri=&quot;file:///usr/local/xml/docbook-xsl/html/docbook.xsl&quot;/&gt;</SPAN></PRE><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">
The rewriteURI element can remap a whole set of URLs from a
particular server. This is very much like the mod-rewrite module in
the Apache web server. For example, this maps all the DocBook
stylesheet URLs to a local directory on a Unix box:</P>
<PRE LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">    &lt;rewriteURI
<SPAN LANG="en-US">        uriStartString=&quot;http://docbook.sourceforge.net/release/xsl/current/&quot;</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">        rewritePrefix=&quot;file:///usr/local/xml/docbook-xsl/&quot; /&gt;</SPAN></PRE><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">
For various technical reasons, if you're remapping the URLs in DTD
system identifiers, you use a rewriteSystem element instead of a
rewriteURI element:</P>
<PRE LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"> &lt;rewriteSystem
<SPAN LANG="en-US">        systemIdStartString=&quot;http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/4.2/&quot;</SPAN>

	Using Catalog Files</H1>
</OL>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">The
details of how to load a catalog file when processing  a document
vary from parser to parser and tool to tool. Not all XML processors
yet support catalogs, but most of the important ones do. The Gnome
Project's xsltproc, Michael Kay's Saxon, and the XML Apache Project's
Xerces-J and Xalan-J all support catalogs. Notably lacking from this
list are the C++ versions of Xerces and Xalan and Microsoft's MSXML.
And of course it isn't hard to integrate catalog processing into your
own applications with just a little bit of open source code.</P>
<OL START=3>
	<LI><H2 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0cm; page-break-after: avoid">
	libxml2</H2>
</OL>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Daniel Veillard's libxml2 XML parser
for C supports catalogs, as does his libxslt processor that sits on
top of libxml2. libxml2 reads the catalog location from the
XML_CATALOG_FILES  environment variable, which contains a white space
separated list of file names. This can be set in all the usual ways.
For example in bash or other Bourne shell derivatives, to specify
that libxml should use the catalog file found at
/usr/local/xml/catalog.xml you would simply type:</P>
<PRE LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">% XML_CATALOG_FILES=/usr/local/xml/catalog.xml
<SPAN LANG="en-US">% export XML_CATALOG_FILES</SPAN></PRE><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">
In Windows, you'd set this environment variable in the System control
panel. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">This
property can also be set to a white space separated list of file
names to indicate that libxml should try several different catalogs
in sequence. For example, this setting requests that libxml first
look in the file catalog.xml in the current working directory and
then in the file /usr/local/xml/docbook/docbook.cat:</P>
<PRE LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">% XML_CATALOG_FILES=&quot;catalog.xml /usr/local/xml/docbook/docbook.cat&quot;
<SPAN LANG="en-US">% export XML_CATALOG_FILES</SPAN></PRE><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">
If you expect to use the same catalog file consistently, you could
set XML_CATALOG_FILES in your .bashrc file.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Once this environment variable is
set, libxml will consult the catalog for all documents it loads,
whether you're calling the library from your own C++ source code,
from the XSLT stylesheet with the document() function, or using the
command line tools xmllint and xsltproc.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">If you're having trouble with the
catalog, you can put libxml in debug mode by setting the
XML_DEBUG_CATALOG variable. (No value is required. It just needs to
be set.) libxml will then tell you when it recognizes a catalog entry
and what it's actually loading when. I often find this useful for
discovering small, inobvious mismatches between the IDs used in the
instance documents and those used in the catalog. For instance, when
I was writing this chapter, this helped me uncover a mismatch between
the public ID in the catalog and the documents. The catalog was using
-//OASIS//DTD DocBook XML V4.2.0//EN and the source documents were
using -//OASIS//DTD DocBook XML V4.2//EN. The strings really do have
to match exactly. 4.2 is not the same as 4.2.0 when resolving public
IDs.</P>
