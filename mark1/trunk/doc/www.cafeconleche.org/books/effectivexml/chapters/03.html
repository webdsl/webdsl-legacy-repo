expands the set of characters allowed in XML names (i.e. element
names, attribute names, entity names, ID-type attribute values, and
so forth) to allow characters that were not defined in Unicode 2.0,
the version that was extant when XML 1.0 was first defined. However
Unicode 2.0 is fully adequate to cover the needs of markup in
English, French, German, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, Danish,
Dutch, Arabic, Turkish, Hebrew, Farsi, Thai, Hindi, and most other
languages you're likely to be familiar with as well as several
thousand you aren't. However, Unicode 2.0 did miss a few important
living languages including  Mongolian, Yi, Cambodian, Amharic,

intended to enable.  Whereas XML 1.0 was conservative (Everything not
permitted is forbidden) XML 1.1 is liberal (Everything not forbidden

<OL START=2>
	<LI><H1 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">C0 Control Characters</H1>
</OL>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The first 32 Unicode characters with
code points from 0 to 31 are known as the C0 controls. They were
originally defined in ASCII to control teletypes and other monospace
dumb terminals. Aside from the tab, carriage return, and line feed
they have no obvious meaning in text. Since XML is text, it does not
include binary characters such as NULL (#x00), BEL (#x07), DC1 (#x11)
through DC4 (#x14) and so forth. These non-characters are historical
relics used to control teletypes and glass terminals. XML 1.0 does
not allow them. This is a good thing. Although dumb terminals and
binary-hostile gateways are far less common today than they were
twenty years ago, they are still used and passing these characters
through equipment that expects to be seeing plain text can have nasty
consequences including disabling the screen. (One common problem that
still occurs is accidentally paging a binary file on a console. This
is generally quite ugly, and often disables the console.)</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">A few of these characters
occasionally do appear in non-XML text data. For example, the form
feed (#x0C) is sometimes used to indicate a page break. Thus moving
data from a non-XML system such as a BLOB or CLOB field in a database
into an XML document can unexpectedly cause malformedness errors.
Text may need to be cleaned before it can be added to an XML
document. However, the far more common problem is that a document's
encoding is misidentified, for example defaulted as UTF-8 when it's
really UTF-16. In this case, the parser will notice unexpected nulls
and throw a well-formedness error.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">XML 1.1 fortunately still does not
allow raw binary data in an XML document. However, it does allow you
to use character references to escape the C0 controls such as form
feed and bell. The parser will resolve them into the actual
characters before reporting the data to the client application. You
simply can't include them directly. For example, this document uses
form feeds to separate pages:</P>

However, this style of page break died out with the line printer.

Better yet, you might not change the markup at all, just write a
stylesheet that assigns each poem to a separate page. Any of these
options would be superior to form feeds. Most uses of the other C0
controls are equally obsolete.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">There is one exception. You still
cannot embed a null in an XML document, not even with a character
reference. Allowing this would have caused massive problems for C,
C++, and other languages that use null-terminated strings. The null
is still forbidden, even with character escaping, which means it's
still not possible to directly embed binary data in XML. You have to
encode it using Base-64 or some similar format first. (See Item 20).

</OL>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">There is a less common block of C1
control characters between 128 (#x80) and 159 (#x9F). These include
start of string, end of string, cancel character, privacy message,
and a few other equally obscure characters. For the most part these
are even less useful and less appropriate for XML documents than the
C0 control characters. However, they were allowed in XML 1.0 mostly
by mistake. XML 1.1 rectifies this error (with one notable exception
I'll address shortly) by requiring that these control characters be
escaped with character references as well. For example, you can no
longer include a &quot;break permitted here&quot; in element content
or attribute values. You have to write it as &amp;#x82; instead.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">This actually does have one salutary
effect. There are a lot of documents in the world which are labeled
as ISO-8859-1 but which actually use the non-standard Microsoft
character set Cp1252 instead.  Cp1252 does not include the C1
controls. Instead it uses this space for extra graphic characters
such as &euro;, <FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&OElig;, and </FONT><FONT FACE="Clearlyu">&trade;</FONT>.
This causes significant interoperability problems when moving
documents between Windows and non-Windows systems, and it's not
always one that's easy to detect. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">By making escaping of the C1 controls
mandatory, such mislabelled documents will now be obvious to parsers.
Any document that contains an unescaped C1 character which is labeled
as ISO-8859-1 is malformed. Documents that correctly identify
themselves as Cp1252 will still be allowed.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The downside to this improvement is
that there is now a class of XML documents which is well-formed XML

change XML 1.1 makes is of no use to anyone, and should never have
been adopted. XML 1.1 allows the Unicode next line character (#x85,
NEL) to be used anywhere a carriage return, linefeed, or carriage
return-linefeed pair is used in XML 1.0 documents. Note that a NEL
doesn't mean anything different than a  carriage return or linefeed.
It's just one more way of adding extra white space. However, it is
incompatible not only with the installed base of XML software, but
also with all the various text editors on Unix, Windows, the Mac,
OS/2, and almost every other non-IBM platform on Earth. For instance,
you can't open an XML 1.1 document that uses NELs in emacs, vi,
BBEdit, UltraEdit, jEdit, or most other text editors and expect it to
put the line breaks in the right places. Figure 3.1 shows what
happens when you load a NEL-delimited file into emacs. Most other

everybody else on the planet has been using for the last twenty years
at least. Instead they use character #x85, NEL (next line).</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">If you're
one of those few developers writing XML by hand with a plain console
editor on an IBM mainframe, then you should upgrade your editor to
support the line ending conventions the rest of the world has
standardized on. If you're writing C code to generate XML documents
on a mainframe, you just need to use \x0A instead of  \n to represent
the line end. (Java does not have this problem.) If you're reading
XML documents, the parser should convert the line endings for you.
There's no need to use XML 1.1.</P>

</OL>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">For
reasons of compatibility with legacy character sets such as
ISO-8859-1 (as well as occasional mistakes) Unicode sometimes
provides multiple representations of the same character. For example,
the e with accent acute, &eacute;, can be represented as either the
single character #xE9 or with the two characters #x65 followed by
#x301 (combining accent acute). XML 1.1 suggests that all generators
of XML text should normalize such alternatives into a canonical form.
In this case, you should use the single character rather than the
double character. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">However,
both forms are still accepted. Neither is malformed. Furthermore,
parsers are explicitly prohibited from doing the normalization for
the client program. They may merely report a non-fatal error if the
XML is found to be unnormalized. In fact, this is nothing that
parsers couldn't have done with XML 1.0, except that it didn't occur
to anyone to do it. Normalization is more of  a strongly recommended
best practice than an actual change in the language.</P>

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">There's
one other new feature that's effectively part of XML 1.1. XML 1.1
also introduces namespaces 1.1, which adds the ability to undeclare
namespace prefix mappings. For example, consider this API element:

A system that was looking for qualified names in element content
might accidentally confuse the public:void  and  private:int  in the
cpp element with qualified names instead of just C++ syntax (albeit
ugly C++ syntax that no good programmer would write). Undeclaring the
public and private prefixes allows them to stand out for what they
actually are, just plain unadorned text.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">In
practice, however, very little code looks for qualified names in
element content. Some code does look for these things in attribute
values, but in those cases it's normally clear whether or not a given
attribute can contain qualified names or not. Indeed this example is
so forced precisely because prefix undeclaration is very rarely
needed in practice, and never needed if you're only using prefixes on
element and attribute names.  
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">That's it.
There is nothing else new in XML 1.1. It doesn't move namespaces or
schemas into the core. It doesn't  correct admitted mistakes in the
design of XML such as attribute value normalization. It doesn't
simplify XML by removing rarely used features like unparsed entities
and notations. It doesn't even clear up the confusion about what
parsers should and should not report. All it does is change the list
of name and whitespace characters. This very limited benefit comes at
an extremely high cost. There is a huge installed base of XML 1.0
aware parsers, browsers, databases, viewers, editors, and other tools
that doesn't work with XML 1.1. They will report well-formedness
errors when presented with an XML 1.1 document.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">The
disadvantages of XML 1.1 (including the cost in both time and money
of upgrading all your software to support it) are just too great for
the extremely limited benefits it provides most developers. If you're
more comfortable working in Amharic, Mongolian, Yi, Cambodian,
Amharic, Dhivehi, or Burmese and you only need to exchange data with
other speakers of one of these languages (for instance, you're
developing a system exclusively for a local Amharic-language
newspaper in Addis Ababa where everybody including the IT staff
speaks Amharic), then you can set the version attribute of the XML
declaration to 1.1. Everyone else should stick to XML 1.0.
