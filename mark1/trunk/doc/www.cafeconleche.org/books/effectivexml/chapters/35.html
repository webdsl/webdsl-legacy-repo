<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">Whether you're writing
code with DOM, JDOM,dom4j, Sparta, or some other tree-based API, one
of the primary tasks is navigating the document to locate particular
nodes, whether for query or update. XPath is a very powerful, very
robust language for navigating XML documents. It often works better
than explicitly specified navigation using methods such as
getChildNode() or getNextSibling().</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">Navigation in a
tree-based API is a surprisingly complex and error-prone operation.
For example, consider a simple contacts file that includes names and
phone numbers that claims to follow the DTD in Example 35-1:</P>

This is very straight-forward, very simple record-like data. What can
go wrong when processing files like this? Actually, quite a lot,
especially when you realize that not all instance documents are
likely to be so simple or so valid. In fact, all too often you'll
find yourself working with documents like Example 35-3 instead, even
if you're promised data that precisely adheres to the DTD in Example
35-1. Invalid data is a fact of life. It's not acceptable to just
throw up your hands in disgust because someone sent you a document
that's slightly different from what you expected.</P>

Some of these problems are mitigated by particular APIs. XOM resolves
all entity references. DOM requires parsers to place the maximum
possible contiguous run of text in each text node. MSXML throws away
white space only nodes by default. Nonetheless all APIs suffer from
at least several of these problems. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">Validation would catch
some of these problems, though arguably they're not mistakes. For
instance, if people do have multiple phone numbers, but the schema
only allows one, then it's the schema that's mistaken, not the
document. The instance document more correctly reflects reality than
the schema does. The same can be said of a program that assumes every
person has exactly one phone number. The software should be changed,
not the document.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">Is it possible to write
programs that behave correctly even in the face of unexpected changes
in document structure? Surprisingly the answer is yes, it is.
Well-written programs can handle a lot of cases their designers did
not explicitly plan for. The trick is to write programs that fit
document structures loosely rather than tightly. The program should
ask only for the information it needs without tying that to
information it doesn't really care about. For example, if you want to
find Joe Smith's phone numbers, then you need to ask for the Phone
siblings of the Name element whose value is &quot;Joe Smith&quot;.
You don't want to ask for the Phone sibling of the Name element whose
first text node is Joe Smith that's a child of a Contact element
which is a child of the Contacts element which is the root element of
the document. That's too specific. There are too many extra
conditions such as &quot;The root element is Contacts&quot; that
don't have anything to do with what you really want to know.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">It is not possible, of
course, to write perfectly robust software. For instance, there's no
way to find Joe Smith's phone number if it's not in the document
somewhere. However, you can write software that behaves reliably on a
much broader class of documents, and fails gracefully when the
information truly isn't there.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">XPath is a fourth
generation declarative language that allows you to specify which
nodes you want to process without specifying exactly how the
processor is supposed to navigate to those nodes. XPath's data model
is very well designed to support exactly what almost all developers
want from XML. For instance, it merges all adjacent text including
that in CDATA sections, allows values to be calculated that skip over
comments and processing instructions` and include text from child and
descendant elements, and requires all external entity references to
be resolved. In practice, XPath expressions tend to be much more
robust against unexpected but perhaps insignificant changes in the
input document. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">For example, consider a
very simple DOM code fragment that prints all the names in the
contacts file. 
</P>
<PRE CLASS="western">Element contactsElement = doc.getDocumentElement();
NodeList contacts = contactsElement.getChildNodes();
      
for (int i = 0; i &lt; contacts.getLength(); i++) {
  Node current = contacts.item(i);
  if (current.getNodeType() == Node.ELEMENT_NODE) {
     Element contact = (Element) current;
     NodeList children = contact.getChildNodes();
     for (int j = 0; j &lt; contacts.getLength(); j++) {
       Node candidate = children.item(j);
       if (candidate.getNodeType() == Node.ELEMENT_NODE) {
          // Assuming name is the first child element 
          String name = candidate.getFirstChild().getNodeValue();
          System.out.println(name);
          // Assuming there's only one name per contact
          break;
       }

You can see that it lost half of Joe Smith's name, as well as missing
Ben Reilly completely. It also lost track of Jonathan Li and replaced
David Smith with his phone number.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">With a little effort,
we can improve the DOM code to fix most of the problems. The most
important improvement we can make is relying on element names rather
than positions. The second most important improvement is using the
getElementsByTagName() method to search the entire tree rather than
just some expected parts of it. The third most important improvement
(and the most difficult to implement correctly) is not assuming all
text nodes are adjacent. The final fix is removing the assumption
that there's only one name per contact. The improved code follows:</P>
<PRE CLASS="western">      NodeList names = doc.getElementsByTagName(&quot;Name&quot;);
      
      for (int i = 0; i &lt; names.getLength(); i++) {
          Node name = names.item(i);
          String value = getFullText(name);
          System.out.println(value);
      }
  
   // ...
  
    public static String getFullText(Node node) {
        StringBuffer result = new StringBuffer(12);
        NodeList children = node.getChildNodes();
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; children.getLength(); i++) {
          Node child = children.item(i);
          int type = child.getNodeType();
          if (type == Node.TEXT_NODE) {
            result.append(child.getNodeValue());
          }
          else if (type == Node.CDATA_SECTION_NODE) {
            result.append(child.getNodeValue());
          }
          else if (type == Node.ELEMENT_NODE) {
            result.append(getFullText(child));
          }
          else if (type == Node.ENTITY_REFERENCE_NODE) {
            result.append(getFullText(child));
          }
        }
        return result.toString();
    }</PRE><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">
As you can see, this is somewhat more complex. Note especially the
recursion that's necessary to accumulate the complete text of the
node. Complexity would increase further in an API that doesn't have
an equivalent to getElementsByTagName(), a fairly unique feature of
DOM. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">Is there perhaps an
easier way? Yes, there is; and that way is XPath. Now consider this
XPath expression:</P>
<PRE CLASS="western">/Contacts/Contact/Name</PRE><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">
It's about ten times simpler than the DOM version, but accomplishes
almost as much. This returns the desired content even if the Name
elements contain CDATA sections and child elements, and no matter how
many of them appear in any given Contact element. This particular,
XPath expression would still fail if the hierarchy were not just what
was expected; for instance, if the root element were something other
than Contacts or if a Name element were not an immediate child of a
Contact element. However, an XPath expression that uses the
descendant axis would be even more robust. This XPath expression
still succeeds:</P>
<PRE CLASS="western">//Name</PRE><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">
There are numerous ways to integrate XPath processing into your
programs. Most XSLT processors such as Xalan, libxslt, and MSXML
include APIs you can use to merge XPath expressions with your own
code. Unfortunately, there is as yet no standard API for XPath
queries. For example, using Xalan, the above query might look like
this:</P>
<PRE CLASS="western">NodeList results = XPathAPI.selectNodeList(doc, &quot;//Name&quot;);
for (int i = 0; i &lt; results.getLength(); i++) {
  Node result = results.item(i);
  XObject value = XPathAPI.eval(result, &quot;string()&quot;);
  System.out.println(value.str());
}</PRE><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">
In MSXML XPath evaluation is built-into the DOM implementation
classes, which makes for slightly more concise if less portable code.
For example, here's the same XPath search implemented in JavaScript
such as you might use from Internet Explorer:</P>
<PRE CLASS="western">var results = doc.selectNodes(&quot;//Name&quot;);
for (i=0; i &lt; results.length; i++) {
  var node = results.item(i);
  alert(node.text);
}</PRE><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">
Many Java APIs are supported by the Jaxen XPath library
(http://jaxen.sourceforge.net/) including DOM, JDOM, and dom4j. Using
Jaxen on top of DOM, the above query would look something like this:</P>
<PRE CLASS="western">XPath expression = new org.jaxen.dom.DOMXPath(&quot;//Name&quot;);
Navigator navigator = expression.getNavigator();
List results = expression.selectNodes(doc);
Iterator iterator = results.iterator();
while (iterator.hasNext()) {
  Node result = (Node) iterator.next();
  String value = StringFunction.evaluate(result, navigator);
  System.out.println(value);
}</PRE><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">
There are a few things you need to be wary of when integrating XPath
with your more traditional code. First of all, XPath queries return
node-sets, not single nodes. You should be prepared to iterate
through the result, even if you only expect a single node. This
handles cases both where the expected node is missing and where
there's more than you expected. Avoid methods like selectSingleNode()
in MSXML and Xalan that hide such results from the library client.
They significantly reduce robustness. If you absolutely insist that
there can be only one result, then by all means validate the document
against a schema which requires this (Item 38) before processing the
document, and reject it if it fails the schema. Do not simply assume
that all documents passed to the program meet the constraints. Such
assumptions fail far more often than most developers initially
expect, and over a time period of several years almost all such
assumptions fail.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">Secondly, be aware that
you may take a performance hit for choosing XPath, especially if you
use the tree-walking descendant and descendant-or-self axes. The
following axis also tends to be slow. Some (but not all) XPath
engines have major performance problems with the ancestor and
ancestor-or-self axes. You can use the child axis and more explicit
descent instead. However, as noted above this does reduce your
program's robustness. Like all other performance issues, this should
be evaluated within the context of a particular program, system,
library, and use-case. Some systems have CPU power to spare. Others
may be so CPU or memory-limited that the cost of even the most basic
XPath processing is prohibitive. Sometimes switching to a different
XPath engine can produce an order of magnitude improvement in
processing particular XPath expressions. I recommend designing
processing for maximum robustness, and only optimizing the XPath
expressions when and if profiling proves this is a significant
bottleneck.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">Personally, I'm willing
to trade performance for robustness, and I find the opposite opinion
(a willingness to trade correctness for performance) completely
incomprehensible. XPath based navigation is both easier to write and
easier to write correctly than explicit navigation. It produces much
more robust software. If you'd rather process more documents faster,
at the cost of processing some of them incorrectly, you can do so;
but please at least test the performance of an XPath based
alternative before you rule it out.</P>
