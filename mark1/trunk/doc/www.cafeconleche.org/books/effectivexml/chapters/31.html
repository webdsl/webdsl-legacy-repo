<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">Parsers,
DOM implementations, XSLT engines,  and other XML-related tools vary
widely in speed, efficiency,  specification conformance, and
bugginess. Sometimes these characteristics are innate characteristics
of the code and the skill of the programmers who wrote it. Other
times the relative quality depends on the environment. For instance,
early versions of the Xerces XML parser for Java, written by IBM,
tended to perform very well on IBM's Java virtual machine and very
poorly on Sun's Java virtual machine, while the Crimson parser
written by the Sun team had almost precisely opposite performance
characteristics. And still other times, the relative performance of
tools depends on the documents they process. For instance, some DOM
implementations are tuned for relatively small document sizes while
others are tuned for very large documents. Benchmarks based primarily
on large or small documents can come to very different conclusions
about the same tools.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">One of the
best ways to improve performance is to try out different libraries on
your code and pick the one that performs the best for your
application in your environment. However, this only works if you
haven't tied yourself too closely to one parser's API. In SAX2 and
DOM3 it's normally possible to write completely parser independent
code. Do so. For Java, JAXP extends this capability to DOM2. Always
prefer implementation independent APIs like DOM and SAX to parser
dependent APIs like the Xerces Native Interface or ElectricXML.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">A few APIs
such as XOM and JDOM fall somewhere in the middle. They allow you to
choose a different parser, but not a different implementation of
their core classes. If parsing is the bottleneck, this can be
helpful. However, if the bottleneck lies elsewhere, for instance an
inefficient use of strings that bedeviled one JDOM beta, then you're
pretty much stuck with it.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">Unfortunately,
not all standard APIs are as complete as you might wish, so you may
sometimes need to tie yourself to a specific implementation. If this
proves necessary, try to clearly delineate the implementation
dependent parts of your code, and keep those parts as small as
possible.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">Let us now
investigate the details of writing implementation independent code
with different APIs and tools.</P>
<OL>
	<LI><H1 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">SAX</H1>
</OL>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">SAX
enables you to write code that is completely independent of the
underlying parser. The major issue is that you use the
XMLReaderFactory.createXMLReader() method to construct new instances
of the XMLReader interface rather than calling the constructor
directly. For example, this is the correct way to load a SAX2 parser:</P>
<PRE LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">XMLReader parser = XMLReaderFactory.createXMLReader();</PRE><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">
This is the wrong way to load a SAX  parser:</P>
<PRE LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">XMLReader parser = new org.apache.xerces.parsers.SAXParser();</PRE><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">
The first statement loads the parser named by the org.xml.sax.driver
system property. This is easy to adjust at runtime. The second always
loads Xerces, and can't be changed without recompiling. Both
statements may actually create the same object, but the first leaves
open the possibility of using a different parser, without even
recompiling the code. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">You can
hard code the parser you want as a string if you really want to rely
on a specific parser:</P>
<PRE LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">XMLReader parser = XMLReaderFactory.createXMLReader(&quot;org.apache.xerces.parsers.SAXParser&quot;);</PRE><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">
Ideally, however, the string containing the fully package qualified
class name should be part of a resource bundle or other configuration
file that is separate from the code itself, so it can be modified
without recompiling.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">Note</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">This
doesn't work quite as well in other languages as it does in Java. For
instance C and C++ bind early rather than late so you probably need
to recompile to switch to a different parser. Furthermore, although
SAX is fairly common in C and C++ parsers, there is no official
standard for it, so there are often subtle differences between
implementations. Editing code may be required. Languages like Python
and Perl fall somewhere in between Java and C++ in terms of ease of
switching parsers. This doesn't reflect any fundamental limitations
in these languages, just that the programmers who wrote the first
parsers and defined SAX preferred to work in Java. Nonetheless, even
if you're not working in Java, you should still endeavor to write
code that's as parser independent as possible in order to minimize
the amount of work you have to do when swapping out one parser for
another.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">End Note</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">Furthermore,
unless you have very good reasons to limit the choice of parser, you
should always provide a fallback to the default parser if you fail to
load a specific parser by name. Exactly which parsers are available
can vary a lot from environment to environment, especially in Java
1.3 and earlier. For example,</P>
<PRE LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">XMLReader parser;
<SPAN LANG="en-US">try {</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">  parser =</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">    XMLReaderFactory.createXMLReader(&quot;org.apache.xerces.parsers.SAXParser&quot;);</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">}</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">catch (SAXException ex) { // Xerces not found</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">  parser = XMLReaderFactory.createXMLReader();</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">}</SPAN></PRE><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">
As long as you stick to the core classes in the org.xml.sax and
org.xml.sax.helpers packages, your code should be reasonably portable
to any parser that implements SAX2. And although technically
optional, every SAX2 parser I've ever encountered also implements the
optional interfaces in the org.xml.sax.ext packages; that is,
LexicalHandler and DeclHandler.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">One area
in which SAX parsers do differ is support for various features and
properties. Although SAX2 defines  over a dozen standard features and
properties, only two must be implemented by all conformant processors
(http://xml.org/sax/features/namespaces and
http://xml.org/sax/features/namespace-prefixes). The others are all
optional, and some parsers do omit them. If you attempt to set or
read a feature or property which the parser does not understand, it
will throw a SAXNotRecognizedException. If it recognizes the feature
or property name, but cannot set that feature/property to the
requested value, it will throw a SAXNotSupportedException. Both are
subclasses of SAXException. Be sure to catch these, and respond
appropriately. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">Sometimes,
the feature or property is optional for processing, and you can just
ignore a failure to set it. For example, if you attempt to set a
LexicalHandler object and fail, you may not be able to round-trip the
document. However, you'll still get all the information you really
care about:</P>
<PRE LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">try {
<SPAN LANG="en-US">  parser.setProperty(&quot;http://xml.org/sax/properties/lexical-handler&quot;,</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">                      new MyLexicalHandler());</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">}</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">catch (SAXNotRecognizedException ex) { </SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">  // no big deal; continue normal processing</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">}</SPAN></PRE><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">
Other times, you may want to give up completely. For example, if your
code depends on interning of names for proper operations--for
instance, it compares element names using the == operator--then 
you'll want to make sure that the 
http://xml.org/sax/features/string-interning property is true, and
not continue if it isn't: 
</P>
<PRE LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">try {
<SPAN LANG="en-US">  parser.setFeature(&quot;http://xml.org/sax/features/string-interning&quot;, true);</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">}</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">catch (SAXException ex) { </SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">  System.exit();</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">}</SPAN></PRE><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">
And still other times, you may want to take some intermediate course.
For example, if the parser doesn't support validation, you might try
to load a different parser that does:</P>
<PRE LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">XMLReader parser = XMLReaderFactory.createXMLReader();
<SPAN LANG="en-US">try {</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">  parser.setFeature(&quot;http://xml.org/sax/features/validation&quot;, true);</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">}</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">catch (SAXNotRecognizedException ex) {</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">  try { // Load a parser that is known to validate</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">    parser = </SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">     XMLReaderFactory.createXMLReader(&quot;org.apache.xerces.parsers.SAXParser&quot;);</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">     parser.setFeature(&quot;http://xml.org/sax/features/validation&quot;, true);</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">  }</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">  catch (SAXException se) {</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">    // Xerces is not in the classpath</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">    System.exit();</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">  }</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">}</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">// continue with parsing and validating...</SPAN></PRE><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">
In all cases, however, you should not assume that you can actually
set the feature or property you're trying to set. Be prepared for the
attempt to fail, and respond accordingly. This will help your code
either work properly or fail gracefully no matter which parser is
used. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">Another
area in which parsers differ is support for SAX 2.0.1 This minor
upgrade to SAX adds Locator2, Attributes2, and EntityResolver2
interfaces that fill a few small holes in SAX 2.0. These interfaces
are not yet broadly supported (and arguably cannot be supported in a
JAXP-compliant environment). Thus, you need to be more careful when
using them. However, you can test for availability before using them
using instanceof. For example, this code prints the encoding if and
only if the Locator passed to setDocumentLocator() is a Locator2
object:</P>
<PRE LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">public void setDocumentLocator(Locator locator) { 
<SPAN LANG="en-US">  if (locator instanceof Locator2) {</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">    Locator2 locator2 = (Locator2) locator;</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">    System.out.println(&quot;Encoding is &quot; + locator2.getEncoding());</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">  } </SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">}</SPAN></PRE><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">
Alternately, you can simply check the values of the
http://xml.org/sax/features/use-locator2,
http://xml.org/sax/features/use-attributes2, and
http://xml.org/sax/features/use-entity-resolver2 features. If the
parser supports these SAX 2.0.1 classes, then these features will
have the value true. However, if it does not support them, reading
these URLs will probably throw a SAXNotRecognizedException rather
than returning false. This makes them a little more cumbersome than
simply using instanceof.</P>
<OL START=2>
	<LI><H1 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">DOM</H1>
</OL>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">DOM Level
3 should finally make it possible to write completely implementation
independent DOM code, at least in Java. However, in DOM Level 2 some
crucial parts of DOM require parser dependent code, and in other
languages this is likely to remain true in DOM Level 3. In
particular, DOM2 defines no way to:</P>
<UL>

	a document from a stream</P>
</UL>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">Everything
else can be done with pure DOM, but these two operations require
implementation-specific classes. For example, Xerces loads its
DOMImplementation using a non-standard static method in the
org.apache.xerces.dom.DOMImplementationImpl class:</P>
<PRE LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">DOMImplementation impl = DOMImplementationImpl.getDOMImplementation();</PRE><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">
Parsing a document into a DOM tree with Xerces requires instantiating
a non-standard DOMParser class through its constructor like so:</P>
<PRE LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">DOMParser parser = new DOMParser(); 
<SPAN LANG="en-US">parser.parse(&quot;http://www.example.com/&quot;); </SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">Document doc = parser.getDocument();</SPAN></PRE><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">
Other DOM implementations such as Crimson, GNU JAXP, and Oracle use
different classes and patterns.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">In Java,
JAXP provides a partial solution for those DOM implementations that
implement JAXP (which is most of the major DOM implementations for
Java nowadays). The javax.xml.parsers.DOMBuilderFactory class can
load a javax.xml.parsers.DOMBuilder object. This DOMBuilder object
can parse a document or locate a DOMImplementation object:</P>
<PRE LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">DocumentBuilderFactory builderFactory = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
<SPAN LANG="en-US">DocumentBuilder parser = builderFactory.newDocumentBuilder(); </SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">DOMImplementation impl = parser.getDOMImplementation();</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">Document doc = parser.parse(&quot;http://www.example.com&quot;);</SPAN></PRE><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">
The exact implementation loaded is read from the
javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory Java system property.  If
this property is not set, then JAXP looks in the lib/jaxp.properties
properties file in the JRE directory. If that fails to locate a
parser, next JAXP looks for a META-
INF/services/javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory file in all the
JAR files in the classpath. Finally if that fails, then
DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance() returns a default
implementation.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">As with
SAX parsers, you do have to worry a little about exactly which
features the underlying implementation supports. However, for most
applications the basic features shared by all conformant
implementations suffice.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">The second
step in writing implementation independent DOM code is making sure
you only use standard DOM methods. Many DOM implementations including
Xerces's provide extra, useful methods in their implementation
classes. Sometimes these methods can be very helpful and even let you
do things that simply cannot be done via  standard methods, such as
changing or adding a document type declaration to a document.
However, using any of these methods  ties your code to that one
implementation, binding it far more tightly than how you load the
parser or the implementation. Implementation-specific methods can
infect the entire design of your code,  requiring you to completely
redesign a program in order to move it to another implementation, not
just changing a few lines here or there. Think very carefully about
whether you're willing to lock yourself into  a single implementation
before doing this.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">By far the
worst offender here is the Microsoft DOM implementation in MSXML and
.Net. While MSXML supports all the standard parts of DOM, it also
includes many, many non-standard extensions. Worse yet, very little
third-party documentation and almost no official Microsoft
documentation bothers to note the difference between the standard
parts and the Microsoft extensions. Most tutorials and sample code
make very heavy use of the Microsoft extensions, even to the point
where there's almost no standard DOM code left. (By contrast, the
documentation for Xerces-J focuses almost exclusively on the standard
DOM interfaces. The documentation for their non-standard extensions
is relatively hidden, and few books discuss it. It is meant primarily
for &quot;maintainers and developers of the Xerces2 reference
implementation&quot;, not for end users, and its existence is an open
secret for the initiated.) In particular be wary of the following
fields and methods that are very common in programs that use the
MSXML DOM:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">IXMLDOMNode,

</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">One final
thing to keep in mind: although with care you can swap one DOM
implementation for another, you cannot generally mix and match
different DOM implementations in the same program. For example, you
cannot add a GNU JAXP Element object to a Xerces Document object.
Internally, all DOM implementations I've encountered do make intimate
use of the detailed implementation classes, rather than limiting
themselves to the public interfaces. This may be necessary and even
desirable for the implementation internals, but it is not an excuse
for doing the same in the public code that lives above the interface.</P>
<OL START=3>
	<LI><H1 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">JDOM</H1>
</OL>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">There's
only one implementation of JDOM, and JDOM is designed around classes
rather than interfaces. Thus,  some of the same issues that arise
with DOM and SAX don't apply here. It's always been intended that you
use the classes directly in JDOM. However, JDOM does not include its
own parser. Instead it relies on an underlying SAX parser. By default
JDOM ships with and uses Xerces, but this can be changed. Simply pass
the fully package qualified name of the SAX XMLReader implementation
class you want to use to the SAXBuilder constructor. For example,</P>
<PRE LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">SAXBuilder parser = new SAXBuilder(&quot;com.bluecast.xml.Piccolo&quot;);</PRE><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">
This may speed up parsing a little and save some memory (Piccolo is
quite bit more efficient than Xerces). However any improvement is
limited to the actual parsing of the document. Everything after that,
including building, manipulating, and serializing the object tree
takes place with the same JDOM classes no matter which parser you
used initially.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">Whichever
API you choose, try to stick to its well-documented parts. To the
extent possible, use only those methods and classes that are part of
the standard API. That way, if you do encounter performance problems
or outright bugs, you'll have the opportunity to easily fix the
problem by switching to a better implementation rather than having to
adjust your processing avoid the issues.
