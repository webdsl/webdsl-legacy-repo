<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">For me,
this book is the culmination of more than five years of debate,
argument, and discussion about XML with numerous people. Some of this
took place in the hallways at conferences like Software Development
and XMLOne. Some of it took place on mailing lists like xml-dev.
Along the way a few names kept popping up. Sometimes I agreed with
them. Sometimes I didn't, but their conversations and thoughts were
always illuminating and helped clarify my own thinking about XML.
These gurus include Tim Berners-Lee, Tim Bray, Mike Champion, James
Clark, John Cowan, Roy Fielding, Rick Jelliffe, Michael Kay, Murata
Makoto, Uche Ogbuji, Walter Perry, Paul Prescod, Jonathan Robie, and
Simon St. Laurent. I doubt any of them agree with everything I've
written here. In fact, I suspect a couple of them may violently
disagree with most of it. However, as I look at this book, I see
their influences everywhere. If they hadn't written what they've
written, I couldn't have written this book.

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">Many
people helped out in more direct ways with comments, corrections, and
suggestions. Janek Bogucki, Mike Blackstone, Alex, Blewitt, Claude
Len Bullard, Lars Gregori, Gareth Jenkins, Alexander Rankine, Clint
Shank, and Wayne Tanner submitted numerous helpful corrections for
the draft of the manuscript I posted at my web site. Mike Champion,
Martin Gudgin, Sean McGrath, and Tim Bray did yeomanlike service as
technical reviewers. Scott Meyers both founded the series and helped
me keep the focus squarely on track for this series. Their comments
all substantially improved the book. As always, the folks at the
Studio B literary agency were extremely helpful at all steps of the
process. David Rogelberg, Sherry Rogelberg, and Stacey Barone should
be called out for particular commendation. On the publisher's side at
Addison-Wesley, Mary T. O'Brien shepherded this book from contract to
completion.

as always, my biggest thanks are due to my wife Beth without whose
love and understanding this book could never have been completed.
