<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">Learning
the fundamentals of XML might take a programmer a week. Learning how
to use XML effectively might take a lifetime. While many books have
been written that teach developers how to use the basic syntax of
XML, this  is the first one that really focuses on how to use XML
well. This book is not a tutorial. It is not going to teach you what
a tag is or how to write a DTD. I assume you know these things.
Instead it's going to tell you when, why, where, and how to use such
tools effectively (and perhaps equally importantly when not to use
them). 
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">This book
derives directly from my own experiences teaching and writing about
XML. Over the last five years. I've written several books and taught
numerous introductory courses about XML syntax, APIs, and tools.
Increasingly I'm finding that audiences are already familiar with the
basics of XML. They know what a tag is, how to validate a document 
against a DTD, and how to transform a document with an XSLT style
sheet. The question of what XML is and why to use it has been
sufficiently well evangelized. The essential syntax and rules are
reasonably well understood. However, although most developers know
what a CDATA section is, they are not sure what to use one for.
Although programmers know how to add attribute and child nodes to
elements, they are not certain which one to use when. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">Since XML
has become a fundamental underpinning of new software systems, it
becomes important to begin asking new questions, not just what XML
is, but how does one use it effectively? Which techniques work and
which don't? Perhaps most importantly, which techniques appear to
work at first but fail to scale as systems are further developed?
When I teach programming at my university, one of the first things I
tell my students is that it is not enough to write programs that
compile and produce the expected results. It is as important (perhaps
more important) to write code that is extensible, legible, and
maintainable. XML can be used to produce robust, extensible,
maintainable, comprehensible systems or it can be used to create
masses of unmaintainable, illegible, fragile, closed code. In the
immortal words of Eric Clapton, &ldquo;It's in the way that you use
it.&rdquo; 
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">XML is not
a programming language. It is a markup language; but it is being
successfully used by many programmers. There have been markup
languages before, but in the developer community XML is far and away
the most successful. However, the newness and unfamiliarity of markup
languages have meant that many developers are using it less
effectively than they could. Many programmers are hacking together
systems that work, but are not as robust, extensible, or portable as
XML promises. This is to be expected. Programmers working with XML
are pioneers exploring new territory, opening up new vistas in
software, and accomplishing things that could not easily be
accomplished just a few years ago. However one definition of a
pioneer is someone with an arrow in their back, and more than a few
XML pioneers have returned from the frontier with arrows in their
backs.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">Five years
after the initial release of XML into the world, certain patterns and
antipatterns for the proper design of XML applications are becoming
apparent. All of us in the XML community have made mistakes while
exploring this new territory, the author of this book prominently
among them. However, we've learned from those mistakes, and we're
beginning to develop some principles that may help those who follow
in our footsteps to avoid making the same mistakes we did. It is time
to put up some caution signs in the road. We may not exactly say
&ldquo;Here there be dragons&rdquo;, but we can at least say, &ldquo;That
road is a lot rockier than it looks at first glance, and you might
really want to take this slightly less obvious but much smoother path
off to the left.&rdquo;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">This book
is divided into four parts beginning with the lowest layer of XML and
gradually working up to the highest:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">Part
	I covers XML syntax, those aspects of XML that don't really affect
	the information content of an XML document, but may have large
	impacts on how easy or hard those documents are to edit and process.
		</P>
	<LI><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">Part
	II looks at XML structures, the general organization and annotation
	of information in an XML document.  
	</P>
	<LI><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">Part
	III discusses the various techniques and APIs that are available for
	processing XML with languages such as C++, C#, Java, Python, and
	Perl and thus local semantics to the labeled structures of XML. 
	</P>
	<LI><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">Part
	IV explores effective techniques for systems built around XML
	documents, rather than looking at individual documents in isolation.</P>
</UL>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">Although,
this is how I've organized the book, you should be able to begin
reading at essentially any chapter. This book makes an excellent
bathroom reader. :-) You may wish to read the introduction first,
which defines a number of key terms that are used throughout the
book, and which are frequently misused or confused. However, after
that feel free to pick and choose from the topics as your interest
and needs dictate. I've made liberal use of cross-references to
throughout to direct you along other paths through the book that may
be of interest.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">I hope
that this book is a beginning, not an end. It's still early in the
lifespan of XML, and much remains to be discovered and invented. You
may well develop best practices of your own that are not mentioned
here. If you do I'd love to hear about them. You may also take issue
with some of the principles stated here. I'd like to hear about that
too. Discussion of many of the guidelines identified here has taken
place on the xml-dev mailing list, and seems likely to continue in
future. If you're interested in further discussion of the issues
raised in this book, I recommend you subscribe and participate there.

On the other hand, if you find out and out mistakes in this book (The
ID attribute value on p. 87 is missing a closing quote. The word
&ldquo;Cat&rdquo; is misspelled on p. 46.) you can write me directly

I maintain a web page listing known errata for this book, as well as
any updates at http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/effectivexml/</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">I hope
this book makes your use of XML both more effective and more
enjoyable.</P>
