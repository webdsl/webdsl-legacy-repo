XML Syntax</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">XML
applications should be designed around elements and attributes. You
can use a schema or a DTD to constrain which elements and attributes
are allowed where and what their legal content is. You may also
impose additional constraints that affect the content of the document
and that are not expressible in a schema. For example, you might
require that the ID attribute of an Employee element must be the
actual ID of a current or past employee. All of these are constraints
on the content and structure of the document. They generally reflect
the <I>semantics</I> of a particular application domain.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">Despite
some early hype about search engines which understood web pages
because you used a Shoe tag instead of an LI tag (some of which I was
guilty myself, I freely admit) XML is not a semantic language. It is
a syntactic language. Semantics are properly defined by the
individual applications that are built out of XML rather than by XML
itself. With the almost negligible exception of xml:lang, there is
nothing semantic in XML. XML is only syntax.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">It is your
role as the developer to define the semantics that are appropriate
for your application using the underlying XML syntax. However, it is
not your role as a developer to change, add to, or restrict XML's
underlying syntax. Doing so destroys XML's value proposition of a
compatible interoperable data format. Once you have decided to use
XML, you have committed to supporting all of XML: tags, PCDATA,
attributes, CDATA sections, document type declarations, comments,
processing instructions, entity references, character references, and
so on. You do not have the right to throw away any of this. Your
application must handle all of it. Fortunately, this is not hard to
do because the XML parser handles all this for you. Changing the
definition of XML actually requires a lot more work because you can't
rely on standard parsers. You have to write your own. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">It takes
no more effort on your part to allow CDATA sections, comments,
processing instructions, and so on in your documents than it does to
forbid them. If you don't care about these, you can freely ignore
them when processing a document that contains them. You just
shouldn't say that they are disallowed. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">The
classic example of what not to do is SOAP 1.1 (and possibly 1.2; the
final spec for that version has not been released yet). SOAP
explicitly requires that documents contain neither a document type
declaration nor any processing instructions. There are a number of
problems with these requirements, most notably:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">Most
	schema languages cannot verify these constraints. Checking that no
	processing instructions are present actually requires walking the
	entire tree of a SOAP document. For this reason SOAP doesn't
	actually require processors to verify the constraints. A constraint
	that isn't verified is no constraint at all.</P>
	<LI><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">SOAP
	requests and responses cannot be validated against a DTD, even if
	the receiver wishes to do so. This removes a powerful tool from the
	developer's toolbox.</P>
	<LI><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">Both
	SOAP requests and responses are envelopes intended to wrap other
	elements from different namespaces and vocabularies. However, when
	these content elements are copied from existing XML documents and
	systems, they must first be carefully inspected for any processing
	instructions. They cannot be sent as is. This imposes a significant
	burden on a SOAP server or client. 
	</P>
	<LI><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">SOAP
	requests and responses can't be as easily passed through processing
	chains like Cocoon that use processing instructions for their
	intended purposes of defining processing in a particular
	environment.</P>
	<LI><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">Developers
	who have a real need to use processing instructions or a document
	type declaration will probably invent hacks that shoehorn the
	results into comments or empty elements instead, thus reintroducing
	all the problems these constructs cause for SOAP while causing
	additional problems for generic XML systems that don't recognize the
	special comments and elements.</P>
</UL>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">Perhaps
worst of all is the pollution of the XML environment such subsetting
engenders. Because SOAP is so completely broken with respect to
normal XML processing, vendors are pushing special-purpose parsers
that process SOAP documents, but not all well-formed XML 1.0
documents. Furthermore, as I write this, some members of the SOAP
community are pushing the W3C to bless their subset, and not require
XML parsers to support the pieces of XML syntax they disapprove of.
This is an interoperability disaster. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">There are
reasons the SOAP specification chose to forbid processing
instructions and document type declarations. Forbidding document type
declarations means that all content is present in a single document.
This eliminates the possibility of external entities which launch
multiple connections to remote servers or even enable a denial of
service attack. Forbidding processing instructions helps eliminate
covert channels. It means that all information must be passed through
the SOAP vocabulary all processors should understand. However,
forbidding these constructs also eliminates many important uses.
There are other ways to mitigate these problems that don't require
limiting the syntax of XML.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">A better
approach, in my opinion, is taken by XML-RPC. XML-RPC neither
requires nor forbids document type declarations and processing
instructions. It is (perhaps unintentionally) agnostic about these
constructs. You can use them if you wish, but generic XML-RPC servers
and clients will mostly ignore them. The parser may read the document
type declaration and use it to resolve external entity references and
supply default attribute values, but this is completely transparent
to the application receiving data from the parser, as it should be.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm">Restricting
the syntax an application is willing to parse confuses the role of
parser and client application. It is the parser that is responsible
for working with tags, entity references, CDATA sections, document
type declarations, and so forth and translating all of this into
labeled structures for the client program. The client program should
only operate on the output of the parser. It should not require the
parser to do otherwise than it would normally do. Restricting the
syntax an application is willing to accept (as opposed to the
structure it will accept) prevents it from using general purpose
tools and makes your job as a developer much harder for no good
reason. Properly designed XML applications neither notice nor care
how the information is syntactically encoded because the parser
handles all that work for them. Why make your job harder? Allow all
legal XML syntax in your XML applications.</P>
