<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in">There's a
recurring mild flame war on the xml-dev mailing list about when one
should use attributes and when one should use elements. There's a
slightly hotter one about whether one should ever use attributes at
all. The bottom line is that it's really up to you. Do what feels
right for your application. Most developers prefer to use attributes
for metadata as opposed to the data itself, but this is a very rough
rule of thumb at best. Of course, what's data and what's metadata
depends heavily on who is reading your documents for what purpose.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in">One way to
determine whether information is metadata or not is ask yourself
whether a person reading the text would want to see it. For example,
consider the following paragraph from the XML Base specification:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The set of characters
allowed in xml:base attributes is the same as for XML, namely
[Unicode]. However, some Unicode characters are disallowed from URI
references, and thus processors must encode and escape these
characters to obtain a valid URI reference from the attribute value.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in">If I were
to mark this up in DocBook, every word above would be part of the
element content:</P>
<PRE LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">&lt;para id=&quot;p32&quot;&gt;

  <SPAN LANG="en-US">&lt;ulink url=&quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlbase/#Unicode&quot;&gt;[Unicode]&lt;/ulink&gt;.</SPAN>
  <SPAN LANG="en-US">However, some Unicode characters are disallowed from URI references, </SPAN>
  <SPAN LANG="en-US">and thus processors &lt;ulink type=&quot;Must, May, etc.&quot; </SPAN>
  <SPAN LANG="en-US">url=&quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlbase/#dt-must&quot;&gt;must&lt;/ulink&gt; encode </SPAN>
  <SPAN LANG="en-US">and escape these characters to obtain a valid URI reference from the</SPAN>

However, the following parts would be stored in attribute values:</P>

</UL>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in">What
unifies all these pieces of data is that the reader doesn't want to
see any of them as part of the normal flow of text. They're useful,
and they have a purpose. For instance, without the URL in the url
attribute, the browser doesn't know where a link goes to. Without the
id attribute, other pages can't link to this paragraph. Without
revision tracking information, the author can't review and accept or
reject changes. However, none of these things matter to the end
reader, who just wants to read words in a row. Some of the attribute
values may affect how the text is presented to the reader; for
example, whether a word is italicized or whether a link is
underlined. But in no case does the reader actually want to see the
text that makes up the attribute value. After all, this would be much
more confusing:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">p32 The set of characters
allowed in xml:base attributes is the same as for XML, namely
[Unicode  http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlbase/#Unicode ]. However, some
Unicode characters are disallowed from URI references, and thus
processors must Must, May, etc. http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlbase/#dt-must
encode and escape these characters to obtain a valid URI reference
from the attribute value.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in">In a few
cases, the reader may want to see the content of the attribute value
in special circumstances. For instance, when the user moves the mouse
over a link, the browser may show the link title or URL in a tooltip
or the browser status bar. However, this is extra information that
still isn't provided as part of the normal flow of text.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in">The
dividing line between data and metadata isn't nearly as clear in
record-like documents as it is in narrative documents. Different
users may well be interested in different aspects of the content.
What is irrelevant data for one user may well be the whole point for
another reader. There are often several reasonable ways to divide the
data between element content and attribute values. Nonetheless the
same basic principle applies: if the information is core, place it in
element content. Reserve attributes for housekeeping information such
as arbitrary ID numbers.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in">Although
the rough distinction between data and metadata is a useful way to
decide whether or not to place some simple text in an attribute,
there is one rule that trumps this. Structured data should be part of
element content. Attribute values contain undifferentiated text. They
have no substructure, at least none that's accessible to the XML
parser. An attribute value can contain a number, a URL, a date, a
time, or some other atomic value. However, more complicated
structures often require division into component parts, and you can
only reasonably do this with elements. For example, consider this
blockquote element where a src attribute is used to identify the
source of the quote:</P>
<PRE LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">&lt;blockquote src=&quot;Christopher Locke, &amp;quot;Post-Apocalypso,&amp;quot; in 
<SPAN LANG="en-US">The Cluetrain Manifesto, (Cambridge: Perseus Books, 1999), p. 175&quot;&gt;</SPAN>

    <SPAN LANG="en-US">ignored, so long invisible, that they're only now figuring out </SPAN>

  <SPAN LANG="en-US">&lt;/p&gt;</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">&lt;/blockquote&gt;</SPAN></PRE><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in">
There are many different units of information in the src attribute:
the author, the title of the chapter, the title of the book, the
publisher, the page number, and so on. Perhaps these could be divided
into separate attributes like this:</P>
<PRE LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">&lt;blockquote author_name=&quot;Christopher Locke&quot;
            <SPAN LANG="en-US">chapter_title=&quot;Post-Apocalypso&quot;</SPAN>
            <SPAN LANG="en-US">book_title=&quot;The Cluetrain Manifesto&quot;</SPAN>
            <SPAN LANG="en-US">page_number=&quot;175&quot;</SPAN>
            <SPAN LANG="en-US">publisher_name=&quot;Perseus Books&quot;</SPAN>
            <SPAN LANG="en-US">publisher_city=&quot;Cambridge&quot;</SPAN>
            <SPAN LANG="en-US">year=&quot;1999&quot;&gt;</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">... </SPAN></PRE><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in">
However, this loses track of the substructure such as the difference
between first and last name, or the order. For instance, I carefully
wrote the original citation so that it adheres to the rules of the
<I>Chicago Manual of Style</I>. Once it's split into separate
attributes, that's no longer true.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in">Even
worse, what if the chapter has more than one author? There can only
be one attribute with the name author on any given element, but
there's no limit to the number of child elements it can have. No,
what's really called for here is a child source element, even though
the source is obviously metadata about the quotation rather than core
information.</P>

Once the substructure is expressed with elements, it's
straight-forward for a stylesheet to show or hide any parts of the
content you do or do not want shown. For example, you might want to
include the name of the author, the title of the book, the year, and
the page number; but leave out the publisher and chapter. These CSS
rules  accomplish that:</P>
<PRE LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">source, author, book, year, page { display: inline }
<SPAN LANG="en-US">publisher, chapter, city { display: none }</SPAN></PRE><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in">
You really couldn't do that if you just had one big attribute to work
with. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in">Elements
have one final advantage over attributes: they are much more
extensible in the face of future changes. For example, many libraries
like to give the author's birth year in their card catalogs. With
elements this is easy to add:</P>
<PRE LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">&lt;author&gt;
  <SPAN LANG="en-US">&lt;name&gt;&lt;given&gt;Christopher&lt;given&gt; &lt;family&gt;Locke&lt;/family&gt;&lt;/name&gt;</SPAN>
  <SPAN LANG="en-US">&lt;born&gt;1950&lt;/born&gt;</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">&lt;/author&gt;</SPAN></PRE><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in">
With attributes adding additional content is much more cumbersome.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in">One common
use of attributes that I think does clearly meet the characteristic
of being metadata that belongs in an attribute rather than data for a
child element is the need to identify subtype of a particular
element. For instance, in HTML and XHTML, you often see elements
annotated with a class attribute, most commonly div and span:</P>
<PRE LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">&lt;div class=&quot;sect2&quot;&gt;...&lt;/&lt;div&gt;
<SPAN LANG="en-US">&lt;div class=&quot;titlepage&quot;&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">&lt;div class=&quot;informalexample&quot;&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">&lt;div class=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">&lt;span class=&quot;person&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">&lt;span class=&quot;book&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">&lt;img class=&quot;equation&quot; src=&quot;maxwell.gif&quot; width=&quot;120&quot; height=&quot;30&quot;/&gt;</SPAN></PRE><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in">
Here, the class attribute is extending the normally fairly fixed HTML
vocabulary. Identifying elements by class enables the author to apply
different styles or processing rules to elements of different
classes, even though they have the same name. This, I think, is
clearly metadata. It is metadata in the same way that an element name
is metadata. In effect these attributes are substituting for invalid
element names. Thus they belong in the start-tag, just like an
element name. If you find you're using such attributes frequently,
then it indicates that your markup vocabulary is not a good fit to
your data. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in">DocBook
uses the role attribute in a similar way, to allow authors to attach
arbitrary roles to elements that the designers of DocBook did not
anticipate. A little more formally, the DocBook systemitem element
has a class attribute whose value is given as an enumerated list of
specific types of systemitem such as domainname, ipaddress,
newsgroup, and username:</P>
<PRE LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">&lt;phrase role=&quot;formula&quot;&gt;H2O&lt;/phrase&gt;
<SPAN LANG="en-US">&lt;phrase role=&quot;prescription&quot;&gt;Paxil, 20 mg&lt;/phrase&gt;</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">&lt;personname role=&quot;plumber&quot;&gt;</SPAN>
  <SPAN LANG="en-US">&lt;firstname&gt;Laurence&lt;/firstname&gt; </SPAN>
  <SPAN LANG="en-US">&lt;lastname&gt;Bienvenue&lt;/lastname&gt;</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">&lt;/personname&gt;</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">&lt;systemitem class=&quot;domainname&quot;&gt;www.cluetrain.com&lt;/systemitem&gt;</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">&lt;systemitem class=&quot;username&quot;&gt;eharold&lt;/systemitem&gt;</SPAN></PRE><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in">
DocBook treats this very sensibly. If a particular role or class is
found to be used frequently in practice, then it's a strong candidate
for addition to the next version of DocBook as an element. Indeed
several current DocBook elements such as environvar and prompt
started life as systemitem classes or mere roles.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in">In the
end, if you have any doubt about whether information is metadata or
data, I suggest that you place it in element content. There's little
an attribute can do that an element can't, but much that an element
can do that an attribute can't. The costs of mis-marking data that
should be elements as attributes are much higher than the cots of
mis-marking data that should be attributes as elements.</P>
