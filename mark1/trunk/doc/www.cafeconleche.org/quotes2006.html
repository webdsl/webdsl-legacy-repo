They claim that the server isn’t returning HTML for humans to read and interpret, it’s returning XML for machine to machine processing, and how can this work if the client machine doesn’t know what the server is sending. But I claim the client doesn’t “know” anything. It doesn’t know that the message is an invoice, only people know what an invoice is. It doesn’t know that the FirstName element isn’t likely to have the value “Tea Kettle” (barring very strange parents). All we can say it “knows” is the structure of the document and what datatypes the elements and attributes can hold.</p><p>But, WSDL proponents go on to say, what about code generation and data serialization? A crutch, I say, and not a very beneficial one. I’ve never cared for wizard driven development and code generators. They tend to demo well, but ultimately don’t produce maintainable code. Furthermore, this style of SOAP development reinforces the SOAP as RPC/distributed-component/serialized-object perspective and relegates XML to just another serialization framework. The generated code tends to be especially brittle, and breaks when the message returned changes in any way.</p></div></blockquote><p>--Pete Lacey <br class="empty"/>Read the rest in <a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/pete-lacey-ws-criticism">InfoQ: Interview: Pete Lacey Criticizes Web Services</a></p></dd><dt id="quote2006December30">Saturday, December 30, 2006</dt><dd><blockquote><div>you might need to escape > because the character sequence ]]&gt; is not allowed in XML.You might need to escape ' and " because they could appear in an attribute value with the same delimiter.</div></blockquote><p>--Tim Bray on the atom-protocol mailing list, Wednesday, 26 Jul 2006 16:37:24 </p></dd><dt id="quote2006December28">Thursday, December 28, 2006</dt><dd><blockquote><div>SOAP was known to be a badidea in 1999 and, in spite of our comments to that effect, the industrystill insisted on proving that for themselves.</div></blockquote><p>--Roy T.

These sorts of XML “programs” are unreadable, unmaintainable, an order of magnitude larger than necessary, and audaciously inefficient at runtime.</p><p>So, why would anybody use XML in this bizarre way? As far as I can tell, it’s because many so-called programmers just don’t know how to build a compiler.</p></div></blockquote><p>--Alan Holub <br class="empty"/>Read the rest in <a href="http://www.sdtimes.com/fullcolumn/column-20060901-05.html">SD Times </a></p></dd><dt id="quote2006October4">Wednesday, October 4, 2006</dt><dd><blockquote><div>your e-mail seems to imply that the way things should work is that first we write a specification, and then we have implementations, and we somehow manage to get the specification perfect the first time.

This distinguishes it not from database systems, which have always emphasized the fine-grained structure of information, but from contemporary document processing, which frequently fails to allow the meaningful exploitation of document structure.

Further, XML document type definitions (DTDs) and schemas allow fine-grained control over how much variation to allow in the data: Vocabulary designers can require XML data to be perfectly regular, or they can allow a little variation, or a lot. In the extreme case, an XML vocabulary can effectively say that there are no rules at all beyond those required of all well-formed XML. Because XML syntax records only what is present, not everything that might be present, sparse data does not make the XML representation awkward; XML storage systems are typically built to handle sparse data gracefully.</p><p>The most important contribution XML makes to the problem of semi-structured data, however, is to call into question the nature and existence of the problem. As the description makes clear, semi-structured data is just data that does not fit neatly into the relational model. Referring to “the problem of semi-structured data” suggests subliminally that the problem lies in the failure of the data to live up fully to the relational model, rather than in the model and its failure fully to support the natural structure of the data.</p><p>In the wild (that is, in documents, reports, and program data structures as they are encountered in daily life), information takes forms rather different from third normal form.

And peoples' approach to this used to be find some way to arrange to read it. And I pointed out that this is actually not a right response in the long run. You see, people worked on figuring out the details of the secret of Word format. And figured out a lot of them. So there is free software today like OpenOffice that can read Word files. But it is still short term thinking just to address this problem as right because Microsoft can keep changing the Word format. And every time they make Word files in this new format and they send to other people and other people can't read them. And so they feel like have to upgrade word as well and the result is a large number of these Windows users are using new version of Word and they send us these Word files in a different format which our software can't read. And maybe it is patented and we will get sued if we make our free software read.</p><p>To solve this office problem, we have to remove Microsoft's control over the language that people use to communicate with each other and with themselves - like saving your files so you could read your files later. We have to refuse to use word format for this. When people send you a Word file, therefore don't cope with the situation by reading it. Instead it is much better to send back a message saying - please don't ever send me Word files. This is contributing to a serious social problem.

This year or next could be the year consumers pushed back on not being able to listen to or watch content on their system of choice. I speculate that one vector for this will be, of all things, UMDs for the Playstation Portable. In Ireland a UMD retails for about 30 euro, whereas the equivalent DVD could be got for as little as 10 euro. Assuming you upgrade the memory stick to 512Mb or 1Gb you can burn DVDs for playback on the PSP. But the legal and technical status around DVD burning is extrememly vague. Ripping DVDs is also more effort than most people want to go through. However, tell Joe Consumer after shelling out for a PSP that they have to buy Pirates Of The Carribean twice for the kids, once for a relatively portable medium (DVD) and once again for a non-portable format (UMD) which can cost up to 3 times as much, and I predict a riot. I'm also seeing an interesting pattern of people just not buying media of late, either because they don't know what they can do with a DVD/CD, what the limitations across devices are, or don't know what malware or junk the discs are spraying onto their PCs. The back catalog is big enough. In trying to maintain the value and stranglehold over current physical distribution channels, the entertainment industry seems to be creating real problems for itself.

They are loosely coupled with respect to time. Then it is easy to maximize overall server throughput and handle prioritization of requests and failover. Unfortunately, this isn’t widely practiced because of the nature of most of today’s applications frameworks, which do not make asynchrony easy enough for mere mortal programmers, and because the one thing about which asynchrony is unreliable is guaranteed latency, which is essential to a good user experience. The frameworks were derived to support killer apps, which were all about user interface. Failing asynchrony, then at least have a model in which there isn’t a hard link (meaning an IP link) between the client and the server because load and code on servers are always altering and machines do fail. So always go through indirection on the way to the server. URLs and redirects both obviously serve this purpose and, between them, do it very well. Some people swizzle at the DNS level and others at the redirect level, but both let one handle moving load and code around, even at runtime. In either case, don’t require shared secrets, let alone shared code, to make things work. For example, the browser will continue to work with a site even if the code at the site is completely replaced and the language switched and the operating system switched. There is a limit to this. HTTP and HTML are shared secrets between the browser and the server, so perhaps the rule should be to have incredibly few of them and make them incredibly simple, flexible, forgiving, and generic.</blockquote><p>--Adam Bosworth <br />Read the rest in <a href="http://acmqueue.com/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=337&amp;page=2">ACM Queue - Learning from THE WEB </a></p></dd><dt id="quote2006January12">Thursday, January 12, 2006</dt><dd><blockquote cite="http://www.acmqueue.org/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=339&amp;page=3"><p>XML invites us to model information as a tree, but it need not be processed in that form. XML can be understood, and processed, at several different levels of abstraction: </p><ul><li> As a character stream (this is the layer actually defined by the XML spec itself) </li><li> As a sequence of data characters interspersed with markup (a regular language) </li><li> As a tree in the obvious way, with one node per element, and the attributes as decorations on the nodes </li><li> As a graph in which internodal links are defined by parent-child relations between XML elements, by ID/IDREF links, or by application-specific methods of linking between elements </li><li> As a tree or graph annotated with information about data types and validity (as the output of schema validation) </li><li> As an instance of an application data structure, with arbitrary structure, built on the basis of the XML input. </li></ul><p>The multiplicity of levels sometimes confuses new users and may affront the sensibilities of those who see virtue only in the definition of a model with access restricted to a single abstraction layer, provided through a well-controlled application programming interface. Users of descriptive markup, however, have been reluctant to limit themselves to a single level of abstraction. It is convenient to have tools that understand the higher-level abstractions in the list above, but it’s also convenient to be able to copy or transcode XML documents reliably with mechanisms that understand the data only as a stream of characters. Different levels of abstraction are suitable for different processes and applications: A copy program can be happy with XML-as-character-stream, but a typical application program will typically wish to abstract away from the details of the character stream (for example, silently omitting nonsignificant white spaces). Most XML-aware software prefers to work at the element level, but XML editors are frequently an exception, since users who carefully pretty-print their XML comments or markup in an ASCII editor are typically irate if an XML editor reformats the markup.</p><p>If different applications want or need different levels of abstraction, it is certainly understandable that the proponents of descriptive markup, fighting as they were for application independence, would find it an advantage, rather than a disadvantage, to allow XML to be viewed at so many different levels.</p></blockquote><p>--C.
