Topologically speaking, while SGML is an single infinitedimension, XML is an infinite set of infinite dimensions. Mathematicallyspeaking, you can create a one to one relationship with all the pointsof XML to SGML (like it's done considering, for example,"xsl:stylesheet" like a one dimensional SGML element, rather than the"stylesheet" element of the "xsl" namespace). This may lead to implythat SGML and XML have the same "multidimentional" volume. Thus,namespaces don't alter the topological tissue of XML (which remains flatand one-dimentional), but simply adds "classes" of elements to allowelements to share the same name, but have different meanings.	</blockquote>	--Stefano Mazzocchi on the  Apache XML  mailing list	</p></dd><dt>Saturday, January 1, 2000</dt><dd><p><blockquote>1999 was the year that XML stepped away from its research background and became a real technology.Now it's got the support of the software vendor community, as well      as the user community, who've proven its usefulness in their strategic projects.</blockquote>	--Phil Costa,  Giga Information Group<br />Read the rest in <a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1003-200-1509652.html"> CNET.com - News - Enterprise Computing - XML rides the e-business wave</a></p></dd><dt>Friday, December 31, 1999</dt><dd><p><blockquote><p> The                        fastest Web sites, regardless of end-user                        bandwidth, will be the most successful. </p><p>                        When I think of the things I do online -- manage                        my portfolio, buy plane tickets, use a search                        engine -- I'm looking for a page loading                        experience of under one second.

By comparison, I had AElfred doing useful parsing in thefirst couple of hours, and could handle most documents in a couple ofdays (adding character set support and tuning the performance took alittle longer) -- it was an order of magnitude simpler to write an XMLparser than it was to write a general SGML parser.	</blockquote>	--David Megginson on the  xml-dev mailing list	</p></dd><dt>Monday, November 29, 1999</dt><dd>	<p><blockquote>DOM still needs some work before it can truly be an implementation-independent                          API.

In the 1990s, Tim           Berners-Lee created HTML, a hobbled subset of           SGML that completely ignored the latter's           fundamental tenets... and revolutionized the           world economy, creating fortunes and moving           nations. As it conquered the universe, the           weaknesses of HTML began to show, and it           dawned on everyone that they needed something more flexible, more           generic, more reusable, something more like... yes, SGML. They           threw out 90% of the standard to get at that golden 10% that           preserved SGML's essence, gave it a cooler name, and XML was           born.

HTMLwas not an ideal way to manage hundreds of pages of documents. We needed more of what SGML provided -- first of all, anextensible tagset.
