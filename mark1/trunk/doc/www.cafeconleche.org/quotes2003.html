The result of an XML query, on the other hand, has none of these properties. For example, the result of the query “Find all the red things" may contain a cherry, a flag, and a stop sign, each with a different internal structure. In general, the result of an expression in an XML query may consist of a heterogeneous sequence of elements, attributes, and primitive values, all of mixed type. This set of objects might then serve as an intermediate result used in the processing of a higher-level expression. The heterogeneous nature of XML data conflicts with the SQL assumption that every expression inside a query returns an array of rows and columns. It also requires a query language to provide constructors that are capable of creating complex nested structures on the fly -- a facility that is not needed in a relational language.</blockquote>	<p>--Don Chamberlin <br />Read the rest in <a href="http://www.webreference.com/programming/xquery/2.html">XQuery from the Experts: Influences on the design of XQuery - WebReference.com- </a></p></dd><dt id="quote2003December31">Wednesday, December 31, 2003</dt><dd><blockquote cite="http://www.itworld.com/nl/xml_prac/04182002/">I have learned that APIs can play into the hands of those who don't really want you to understand what is going on underneath, as that would threaten their control over your conceptual model of how the system works.

The rave at the time was to make the world look like objects, in particular, to have a bunch of infrastructure that shrouds the fact that objects are distributed. The nirvana ideal was that you could just say Object obj = CreateMeAnObject(), and then call obj.ThisMethod(), obj.ThatMethod(), and you wouldn't know if that object was over in Thailand, right next door, or in the same process. The problem with that type of programming is: it works great in a single process; it works quite well across processes; it works fairly well in a small intranet; but then it completely sucks thereafter.</p><p>If you hide the fact that messages go across a network, and don't know when they go across, you end up with chatty conversations. And all of a sudden, the speed of light can become a big problem for you. You can't engage in a conversation with an object out in New York that goes, obj.LetMeGetX(), obj.LetMeGetY(), obj.LetMeGetZ(). No, you need to say, obj.LetMeGetXYAndZ(), and have everything come back in one chunk. But you can't really do that unless you actually make people understand that they are building a distributed application. In other words, you shouldn't try to pretend that a remote object is just a local object, because there is a difference. That's one thing that works so well about web services.</p><p>Moreover, web services run on existing infrastructure that we know scales. Web services that run over HTTP are just machine-to-machine communication over precisely the same infrastructure that we all use daily when we use browsers. And we know perfectly well how to scale that. If there's anything we know about scaling up, that's it. So why not leverage that? That's what web services do. Whereas, we know precious little about how to scale CORBA systems in a geo-scalable fashion. We just don't. There's just no knowledge about it, and I've never heard of anyone being particularly successful doing it.</p></blockquote>	<p>--Anders Hejlsberg <br />Read the rest in <a href="http://www.artima.com/intv/abstract.html">Innapropriate Abstractions </a></p></dd><dt id="quote2003December16">Tuesday, December 16, 2003</dt><dd>			<blockquote cite="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1108190,00.html">experiments have shown that documents in a compressed XML file are usually significantly smaller than the Microsoft Word's native file format, a binary format that one might imagine would take less space.

Lots of people went running at that brick wall over, and over, and over again, trying to find a way to make these large scale distributed references really work.

For 20 years people had been failing to solve these problems in any large-scale way.

Coming up with those names, URLs, is a relatively straightforward thing. He did that, and that enabled a lot of what the Web is today. But the Web has all these problems. What happens if a Web page moves or gets deleted? That is exactly the problem of maintaining or managing the configuration of any large scale distributed system.

The two critical questions are "Does the support come from the reader, or from an advertiser, patron, or the creator?" and "Is the support mandatory or voluntary?"</p><p>The internet adds no new possibilities. Instead, it simply shifts both answers strongly to the right. It makes all user-supported schemes harder, and all subsidized schemes easier. It likewise makes collecting fees harder, and soliciting donations easier. And these effects are multiplicative.

The weblog world is driven by a million creative people, driven to get the word out, willing to donate their work, and unhampered by the costs of xeroxing, ink, or postage. Given the choice of fame vs fortune, many people will prefer a large audience and no user fees to a small audience and tiny user fees. This is not to say that creators cannot be paid for their work, merely that mandatory user fees are far less effective than voluntary donations, sponsorship, or advertising.</p><p>Because information is hard to value in advance, for-fee content will almost invariably be sold on a subscription basis, rather than per piece, to smooth out the variability in value.

It is being used by people who view it as being an encapsulation of semantics and data, and it's not. XML is purely a way of structuring files, and as such, really doesn't add much to the overall picture. XML came from a document preparation tradition. First there was GML, a document preparation system, then SGML, a document preparation system, then HTML, a document preparation system, and now XML. All were designed as ways humans could structure documents. Now we've gotten to the point where XML has become so obscure and so complex to write, that it can no longer be written by people. If you talk to people in Sun about their libraries that generate XML, they say humans cannot read this. It's not designed for human consumption. Yet we're carrying around all the baggage that's in there, because it's designed for humans to read. So XML is a remarkably inefficient encoding system. It's a remarkably difficult to use encoding system, considering what it does. And yet it's become the lingua franca for talking between applications, and that strikes me as crazy.</blockquote>	<p>--Dave Thomas <br />Read the rest in <a href="http://www.artima.com/intv/plain4.html">Plain Text and XML </a></p></dd><dt id="quote2003August26">Tuesday, August 26, 2003</dt><dd>		<blockquote cite="http://www.meet-the-makers.com/conversations/dwws/2/"><p>All font tags do is double the bandwidth that's needed to view your site, while undercutting underlying document semantics that might help your page travel beyond the traditional desktop browser.

The second problem is a single sentence in the specification: "Primitive datatypes can only be added by revisions to this specification".

Code is disappearing all the time. You probably can't go to a store and ask for a copy of Word 1, or whatever the first version of Word was called. So we are losing vast quantities of information, because we can no longer read the files.</p><p>One of the reasons we advocate using plain text is so information doesn't get lost when the program goes away. Even though a program has gone away, you can still extract information from a plain text document. You may not be able to make the information look like the original program would, but you can get the information out. The process is made even easier if the format of the plain text file is self-describing, such that you have metadata inside the file that you can use to extract out the actual semantic meaning of the data in the file. XML is not a particularly good way to do this, but it's currently the plain text transmission medium du jour.</p><p>Another reason for using plain text is it allows you to write individual chunks of code that cooperate with each other. One of the classic examples of this is the Unix toolset: a set of small sharp tools that you can join together. You join them by feeding the plain text output of one into the plain text input of the next. There's no concept of trying to make sure the word count program outputs things in a format that's compatible with the next tool in the chain. It's just plain text to plain text, and that's a very powerful way to do it. </p></blockquote>	<p>--Dave Thomas <br />Read the rest in <a href="http://www.artima.com/intv/plain.html">Plain Text and XML </a></p></dd><dt id="quote2003July7">Monday, July 7, 2003</dt><dd>		<blockquote>	the other strength of SAX comes when you're going to bebuilding an in-memory tree anyway, but it does not happen to be a DOMtree.

To tag data richly, you still have to know the data. Tagging 'everything that could be of interest' is still impossible (not just impractical, but impossible). All XML does is get some extraneous difficulties out of the way of solving those problems. It allows you to avoid tying the data tightly to a specific hardware or software platform.

The dramatic uptake of standardized ways of representing information has had a significant impact on the way companies think about the information they produce and the applications they share. Part of the evidence of this influence is that, as analysts who now completely focus on XML and Web services and the way they are changing enterprise architectures, we have spoken with more than 500 software vendors and end users--none of which now thinks that producing data in proprietary formats or with proprietary interfaces is tenable in the long term. The pervasiveness and widespread adoption of XML has in fact changed the economics of technology adoption--while in the past it might have been economically feasible to work in a vendor-proprietary, closed environment, the reverse is now the case.
