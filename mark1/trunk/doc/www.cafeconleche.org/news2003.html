Mulberry Tech has posted the
Call for Participation for 
<a href="http://www.mulberrytech.com/Extreme/index.html">Extreme Markup Languages 2004</a> which takes place from  August 2-6, 2004 in 
Montr√©al. Extreme is a technical 
conference devoted to markup, markup 
languages, markup systems, markup applications, 
and software for manipulating and exploiting 
markup.  At 
Extreme Markup Languages, software developers, tag 
set designers, librarians, computer scientists, 
linguists, markup theorists, 
taxonomists, publishers, lexicographers, 
typographers, and other XML brick layers 
and pipe-fitters devote the better part of a week 
to discussing questions like:</p>

<ul>	<li>Is 
XML sufficiently invisible to be considered a 
success?</li>	<li>Will RDF or Topic Maps ever 
take off?</li>	<li>Who said documents went 
away?</li>	<li>Do you FO?</li>	<li>Will 
Office 2003 change everything? Anything?</li> 	<li>How does a Topic Map mean?</li> 	<li>Got metadata?</li>	<li>Will the 
schema language chaos hurt XML?</li> 	<li>Should we sign a tag set 
non-proliferation pledge?</li>	<li>Can 
validation co-exist with 
versioning?</li>

	href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/CR-speech-synthesis-20031218/">Speech
	Synthesis Markup Language Specification</a>. According to the
	abstract, the Speech Synthesis Markup Language "is designed to provide a rich, XML-based markup language for assisting the generation of synthetic speech in Web and other applications. The essential role of the markup language is to provide authors of synthesizable content a standard way to control aspects of speech such as pronunciation, volume, pitch, rate, etc. across different synthesis-capable platforms."

The  W3C Multimodal Interaction working group has posted the second public working draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-emma-20031218/">EMMA: Extensible MultiModal Annotation markup language</a>. According to the abstract, "This document is part of a set of specifications for multi-modal systems, and provides details of an XML markup language for describing the interpretation of user input. Examples of interpretation of user input are a transcription into words of a raw signal, for instance derived from a speech or pen input, a set of attribute/value pairs describing their meaning, or a set of attribute/value pairs describing a gesture. The interpretation of the user's input is expected to be generated by signal interpretation processes, such as speech and ink recognition, semantic interpreters, and other types of processors for use by components that act on the user's inputs such as interaction managers."

The W3C Cascading Style Sheets working group
has posted two related last call working drafts about printing with CSS,
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-css-print-20031218">CSS Print Profile</a> and
 <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-css3-page-20031218">CSS3 Paged Media Module</a>. The CSS Print Profile "defines a subset of Cascading Style Sheets Level 2 [CSS2] and CSS3 module: Paged Media [PAGEMEDIA] specifically for printing to low-cost devices. It is designed for printing from mobile devices, where it is not feasible or desirable to install a printer-specific driver, and for situations were some variability between the device's view of the document and the formatting of the output is acceptable."
</p>

<p>
The CSS3 Paged Media Module "describes the page model that partitions a flow into pages. It builds on the CSS3 Box model module and introduces and defines the page model and paged media. It adds functionality for pagination, page margins, headers and footers, image orientation. Finally it extends generated content for the purpose of cross-references with page numbers."
 Comments are due by January 31 for both.

The W3C Web Services Internationalization Task Force
has published the first public Working Draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-ws-i18n-req-20031217/">Requirements for the Internationalization of Web Services</a>. According to the intro,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
A Web Service is a software application identified by a URI [RFC2396], whose interfaces and binding are capable of being defined, described and discovered by XML artifacts, and which supports direct interactions with other software applications using XML based messages via Internet-based protocols. The full range of application functionality can be exposed in a Web service.
</p>

<p>
The W3C Internationalization Working Group, Web Services Task Force, was chartered to examine Web Services for internationalization issues. The result of this work is the Web Services Internationalization Usage Scenarios document [WSUS].Some of the scenarios in this document demonstrate that to achieve worldwide usability, internationalization options must be exposed in a consistent way in the definitions, descriptions, messages, and discovery mechanisms that make up Web services.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Mostly this document proposes new SOAP features for expressing various
user preferences for language, number sorting, date formats, etc.
However, it also suggests the possibility of extending language tags
(en, en-US, en-US-LA, en-US-LA-YAT) with other locale information
such as time zone and collation preferences. At first read, that doesn't sound like a very good idea to me. I think these ought to be separate, independently
parseable items rather than tying them all together in one unmarked-up string.

</ul>

<p>Quoting from the overview document,</p>

<blockquote>   The OWL Web Ontology Language is designed for use by applications that need to process the content of information instead of just presenting information to humans. OWL facilitates greater machine interpretability of Web content than that supported by XML, RDF, and RDF Schema (RDF-S) by providing additional vocabulary along with a formal semantics. OWL has three increasingly-expressive sublanguages: OWL Lite, OWL DL, and OWL Full.</blockquote>

The W3C XQuery working group has published a new working draft of
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-xqueryx-20031219">XML Syntax for XQuery 1.0 (XQueryX)</a>, the first update of this spec in more than two years.
This defines a very ugly, pure XML-based syntax for XQuery that doesn't even 
use normal XPath syntax. Frankly, this syntax is so incredibly horrid
that one suspects the working group deliberately sabotaged the effort 
in order to silence all the critics who've been complaining that 
XQuery is only pseudo-XML. However, XSLT is a proof by example that 
XML syntaxes for Turing-complete languages for processing XML don't need to be 
illegible. XQuery could be written in XML. The working group has simply chosen not to enable that in any real way. Neither XQueryX nor the pseudo-XML of real XQuery is an acceptable solution. The W3C should either abandon XML syntax for this effort completely for something along the lines of the RELAX NG compact syntax or define a genuine, usable XML syntax like XSLT's. The current XQuery  syntaxes are just condescending, convoluted, and confusing.

and
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-xsl11-20031217">Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) Version 1.1</a>.
  Note that these cover what is normally referred to as XSL Formatting Objects, not XSL Transformations. According to the requirements abstract,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Since becoming a Recommendation on 15 October 2001, XSL 1.0 has enjoyed widespread support. However, the user community has expressed requirements that have encouraged various implementations to provide extensions to the language. These extensions--especially those implemented by more than one implementation--are clear candidates for standardization so as to maximize interoperability.
</p>

<p>
The XSL Working Group has surveyed and analyzed various existing extensions, user requirements, and features intentionally cut from XSL 1.0 due to lack of time. Using the results of this research, the Working Group is developing an XSL 1.1 version that incorporates current errata and includes a subset of relatively simple and upward compatible additions to XSL
</p>

New features planned for <acronym title="XSL Formatting Objects">XSL-FO</acronym> 1.1 are:

<ol>
	<li>   Change bars</li>
	<li>   Index improvements, especially merging page numbers</li>
	<li>   Conditional graphic scaling, e.g., "scale-down-to-fit"</li>
	<li>    Table of contents windows (aka bookmarks)</li>
	<li>    Table markers that allow dynamically determined text to be put into table headers or footers</li>
	<li>   Support for a value of "only" for the page-position property</li>
	<li>   Support for a <code>page-number-citation-last</code> formatting object (retrieving the last page number of a section or document)</li>

Sun has posted the <a href="https://jsr206-public.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=555">first public review draft specification of 
the Java API for XML Processing 1.3</a>. New features in this release include:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>XPath support</li>
	<li>Optional XInclude support</li>
	<li>SAX 2.0.1 with extensions</li>
	<li>XML 1.1 support</li>
	<li>DOM Level 3</li>
	<li>A  <code>javax.xml.Version</code> class for getting information about
	    the implementation</li>
	<li>The <code>javax.xml.validation</code> package for schema-language agnostic validation.</li>
<li>A <code>SecureProcessing</code> class that sets limits on entity expansion and 
  maximum node occurrences in schemas. </li>
  <li>An <code>XMLConstants</code> class that provides various common namespace URIs</li>
  <li>An <code>XMLUtils</code> class for checking XML names</li>
</ul>


<p>
There's some interesting new stuff here. However, a lot of old rough edges have not yet been smoothed out. For instance, under the description of <code>DOMSource</code>, we read, "The model of
how the Transformer deals with the DOM tree in terms of mismatches with the 
    XSLT data model or
other data models is beyond the scope of this document." This is exactly the sort of problem the spec needs to address head on if true interoperability between different implementations is to be possible. 
</p>

<p>
The spec itself is written in DocBook. It's published more openly on java.net,
as well the usual license encumbered publication in the Java Community Process.

<p> The W3C Resource Description Framework (RDF) Core Working
Group has published six  proposed recommendations.
This set of six replaces the original two Resource Description Framework specifications from 1999, RDF Model and Syntax and RDF Schema.
The six new specs are:
 </p>

<dl> 
<dt><a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/PR-rdf-primer-20031215/">RDF
Primer</a></dt> 
<dd> According to the introduction, RDF 
<blockquote>
<p>
The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a language for representing information about resources in the World Wide Web. It is particularly intended for representing metadata about Web resources, such as the title, author, and modification date of a Web page, copyright and licensing information about a Web document, or the availability schedule for some shared resource. However, by generalizing the concept of a "Web resource", RDF can also be used to represent information about things that can be <em>identified</em> on the Web, even when they cannot be directly <em>retrieved</em> on the Web. Examples include information about items available from on-line shopping facilities (e.g., information about specifications, prices, and availability), or the description of a Web user's preferences for information delivery.
</p>

<p>
RDF is intended for situations in which this information needs to be processed by applications, rather than being only displayed to people. RDF provides a common framework for expressing this information so it can be exchanged between applications without loss of meaning. Since it is a common framework, application designers can leverage the availability of common RDF parsers and processing tools. The ability to exchange information between different applications means that the information may be made available to applications other than those for which it was originally created.
</p>

<p>
RDF is based on the idea of identifying things using Web identifiers (called Uniform Resource Identifiers, or URIs), and describing resources in terms of simple properties and property values. This enables RDF to represent simple statements about resources as a graph of nodes and arcs representing the resources, and their properties and values.

</p>
<ul>

<li>Silent recovery from error is harmful.</li>
<li>The identification mechanism for the Web is the URI.</li>
<li>A resource owner SHOULD assign a URI to each resource that others will expect to refer to.</li>
<li>Web architecture does not constrain a Web resource to be identified by a single URI.</li>
<li>Resource owners should not create arbitrarily different URIs for the same resource.</li>
<li>If a URI has been assigned to a resource, agents SHOULD refer to the resource using the same URI, character for character.</li>
<li>Avoid URI ambiguity.</li>
<li>Authors of specifications SHOULD NOT introduce a new URI scheme when an existing scheme provides the desired properties of identifiers and their relation to resources.</li>
<li>Agents making use of URIs MUST NOT attempt to infer properties of the referenced resource except as licensed by relevant specifications.</li>
<li>A resource owner who creates a URI with a fragment identifier and who uses content negotiation to serve multiple representations of the identified resource SHOULD NOT serve representations with inconsistent fragment identifier semantics.</li>
<li>User agents MUST NOT silently ignore authoritative server metadata.</li>
<li>Agents do not incur obligations by retrieving a representation.</li>
<li>Publishers of a URI SHOULD provide representations of the identified resource consistently and predictably.</li>
<li>Publishers of a URI SHOULD provide representations of the identified resource.</li>
<li>Format designers SHOULD provide for version information in language instances.</li>
<li>Format designers SHOULD document change policies for XML namespaces.</li>
<li>Language designers SHOULD provide mechanisms that allow any party to create extensions that do not interfere with conformance to the original specification.</li>

The W3C XML Core Working Group has published a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/PER-xml-infoset-20031210">proposed edited recopmmendation of the XML Information Set</a>. The changes are very minor overall. A lot of specific references to XML 1.0 have been deleted, and some very obscure points on what happens when a notation is declared multiple times have been clarified. 
This shouldn't have much effect on anybody.

and <a href="http://xquark.forge.objectweb.org/bridge/index.html">XQuark Bridge 1.0.0</a>. 
XQuark Fusion is an "information integration engine, based on XQuery, for querying in real-time multiple, heterogeneous and distributed data sources."
Data sources include 
relational databases wrapped through XQuark Bridge and XML files.
"XQuark Bridge expands existing relational database functionalities with advanced XML import/export capabilities. It supports flexible extraction and publishing of relational data into any target XML format, using the XQuery language. Using a powerful mapping language, it can also perform efficient insertion of structured XML data into existing relational tables, while taking into account the database integrity constraints and transforming the implicit relations appearing in the XML document into explicit ones in the database."
Both are published under the LGPL.

Howard Katz has posted version 0.61 of <a href="http://xqengine.sourceforge.net/">XQEngine</a>,  an
open-source, Java-based query engine for collections of XML documents.
According to Katz,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Utilizing XQuery as its front-end query language, it lets you interrogate collections of XML documents for boolean combinations of keywords, much as Google and other search engines let you do for HTML. XQuery, however, provides much more powerful search capabilities than equivalent HTML-based engines, since its XPath component lets you specify constraints on attributes and element hierarchies, in addition to the specific word content you're searching on. Refer to the W3C's XML Query website to see what the W3C and other vendors are doing with XQuery and XPath.
</p>

<p>
XQEngine is a compact (roughly 250K) embeddable component written in Java. It's not a standalone application and requires a reasonable amount of Java programming skill to use. It has a straightforward programming interface that makes that fairly easy to do. It's single-threaded and should work well as a personal productivity tool on a single desktop, as part of a CD-based application, or on a server with low to moderate traffic. (Making the engine thread-capable is not overly difficult and remains a future project.)

While googling around on an unrelated topic yesterday, I discovered <a href="http://wamcom.org/">WaMCoM Mozilla</a>. "The intention of WaMCom.org is to produce web browser and mail client software that is more stable and more correct than the test releases produced by the Mozilla.org organization, in the hope it is suitable for end users. In order to achieve that, stable Mozilla releases are extended with correctness fixes.
In addition it contains some security and cryptography enhancements."
</p>

<p>
Most important for my purposes, WaMCoM makes Mozilla 1.3.1 available for Mac OS 9. In this morning's testing it appears substantially more stable than the Mozilla 1.2.1 I had been using. The Mozilla Project dropped support for
 Mac OS 9 after 1.2.1,  a version that has an annoying tendency to crash when more than  a dozen or so windows are open. I need to spend a couple more weeks with this to be sure, but I've been happily surfing this morning using WaMCoM with dozens of windows open simultaneously, and right now it looks like all Mac OS 9 users should upgrade. This may let me put off buying a new desktop Mac and switching to OS X for a few more months. Hmm, Looks like I spoke too soon. I just managed to crash it by opening a few dozen pages at the New York Times. Still it may be a bit more satble than 1.2.1.

<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-soap12-os-ucr-20031112/">SOAP Optimized Serialization Use Cases and Requirements</a>. This note makes it pretty clear that the group intends to move away from XML as the format for SOAP messages. That's fine. If XML is not suitable for their use-cases, then they should use something else. One tool does nto fit all needs.
However, I do wish the working group would be more open and up-front that this is in fact what they're doing. If you're not going to use XML, please stop using the word "XML" to describe what you are using. It's nto XML and its not going to be.

My <a href="http://www.hr.com/hrcom/general/pf.cfm?oID=5635CFB8-953A-4776-AAD8B1E1404DC46F">Google number</a> is <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=%22Elliotte%2BRusty%2BHarold%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search">51,900</a>. 
Pretty good. I'm running ahead of <a href="http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/000186.html">Grady Booch, Bertrand Meyer, and Jerry Pournelle but behind 
Linus Torvalds, Tim Berners-Lee, Jesus Christ, and the Beatles</a>. 
</p>

<p>
I'm pretty sure Booch, Meyer, and Pournelle are all more famous than me and deservedly so. I suspect this has a lot to do with how much of your fame comes from the Web, and how much you self-post. I personally generate thousands of pages a year with my name on them between this site, seminar notes, archived mailing list postings, and other similar content. Plus, I suspect Google counts the pages on different URLs for my sites (e.g. http://www.cafeconleche.org/ and http://www.ibiblio.org/xml) as separate pages, so my number needs to be at least divided by two. I can't let my head get too big.
</p>

<p>
One advantage to such huge amounts of self-generated content is that what you're likely to find out about me on the web is pretty much what I want you to know about me. I control my own image. I was curious to see how much information I don't want random surfers to know popped up on the Web, so I did some searches for my name in conjunction with my home address, social security number, phone number, and so forth. I am pleased to report that I don't think you can find any of that without paying for it or asking me. In the past some of this data popped up in the domain name registration records and <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?q=&amp;url=http://www.cafeaulait.org">Alexa</a>, but I think I've managed to scrub all that. There is still one way to find my address and home phone number on the Web, but you've got to think about it. You can't just google me. And now that I've noticed it, I'm going to see what I can do about scrubbing it too.

 XQuisitor is just a layer of GUI icing on top of the Saxon cake.

 	XQuisitor is still rough around the edges, but I think it's useful enough for anyone who wants to explore XQuery.

The GUI is written in Swing.

It's mostly been tested on Linux and a little on Mac OS X 10.2. It should run on any Java 1.4 platform, but I haven't verified that. Java 1.4 and Saxon 7.8 are required. XQuisitor is published under the GPL.

The XML Apache Project has released version 2.6 of 
<a href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces2-j/">Xerces-J</a>, the popular open source
XML parser for Java. This 
expands the experimental support for DOM Level 3 and moves SAX up to 2.0.1.
In addition, some bugs were fixed, including the correct setting of base URIs for documents read from a redirected HTTP request.
It also enables XML 1.1 by default, a very bad decision. Currently I can count the number of people in the world who need XML 1.1 on the fingers of one hand. Hell, that's too generous. I can count them on one thumb. 
There's no excuse for making this the default option. 
I can't say I'm surprised by this, though. IBM is the primary author of Xerces,
and the prime mover behind XML 1.1.
Despite all the nice talk about supporting minority languages, the real motive for XML 1.1 is to support the non-standard, non-interoperable line breaking conventions used on some IBM mainframes. 
I'm working on figuring out how to disable the XML 1.1 support. Once that's done, I'll probably make this the default parser for XOM, since other than the XML 1.1 issues, Xerces is a very nice parser.

<p> The W3C Quality Assurance (QA) Activity has posted
the candidate recommendation of <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/CR-qaframe-spec-20031110/">QA
Framework: Specification Guidelines</a>.
Accorsing to the abstract, "The principal goal of this document is to help W3C Working Groups to write clearer, more implementable, and better testable technical reports. It provides both a common framework for specifying conformance requirements and definitions, and also addresses how a specification might allow variation among conforming implementations, both of which facilitate the generation of test materials. The material is presented as a set of organizing guidelines and verifiable checkpoints."
 Comments are due by May 10.

I've posted <a href="XOM/">XOM 1.0d22</a>, my tree-based streaming API for processing 
XML with Java. This release collects a large number of small fixes and improvements including recoverable validity errors, node-level DOM conversion,
Unicode normalization form C support, and more.
There are API level changes in this release that will affect many users. The largest is that <code>NodeList</code> has been renamed <code>Nodes</code>. The second largest is that <code>ParseException</code> has been renamed <code>ParsingException</code> to avoid a name conflict with <code>java.text.ParseException</code>. 
However, I am getting very close to API freeze. They're only a couple of possible API changes still  being considered, all in <code>Canonicalizer</code> and <code>NodeFactory</code>. 
The rest of the API should be stable.  
The XInclude support is going to have to be changed to support the 
latest working draft (this is probably the last release that will support the old namespace URI and syntax) but I don't anticipate this requiring backwards incompatible changes to the API. 
Details on the web page.

I've posted the notes from last night's <a href="slides/xmlsig/xquery">XQuery presentation</a> to the New York XML Special Interest Group. We had a small but enthusiastic crowd of about 20 people. One thing that became apparent by the end of the evening was that the XPath 2.0 data model is deeply confusing, at least on first presentation, especially compared to XSLT 1.0. The problem surfaced very early with my first sample query:
</p>

<pre>
   for $t in doc("bib.xml")/bib/book/title
   return
      $t 
</pre>

<p>
This replaced the first query I've used in some other presentations:
</p>

<pre>&lt;bib>
  {
   for $t in doc("bib.xml")/bib/book/title
   return
    &lt;book>
     { $t }
    &lt;/book>
  }
&lt;/bib></pre>

<p>
  I thought the first query was simpler because it didn't use direct element constructors, and made it more apparent that an XQuery is not an XML document.
(Another design feature several attendees objected to, by the way.
Trying to explain exactly when, where, and how it was necessary to escape different content was another high, holy mess.) However, the second query 
produces a single element, which can be obviously serialized as an XML document.
People liked this. The first query produces a sequence of element nodes, which Saxon serializes as several  document fragments, like so:
</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;title&gt;TCP/IP Illustrated&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Data on the Web&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;title&gt;The Economics of Technology and Content for Digital TV&lt;/title&gt;
</code></pre>


<p>
Aside from the text declarations, this isn't any different than you might see in XSLT 1.0. And I pointed out that this was hardly the only possible serialization of the result sequence. For example, if you turned on wrapping, Saxon gives you this output instead:
</p>

<pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;result:sequence xmlns:result="http://saxon.sf.net/xquery-results"&gt;
   &lt;result:element&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;TCP/IP Illustrated&lt;/title&gt;
   &lt;/result:element&gt;
   &lt;result:element&gt;

      &lt;title&gt;Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment&lt;/title&gt;
   &lt;/result:element&gt;
   &lt;result:element&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;Data on the Web&lt;/title&gt;
   &lt;/result:element&gt;

   &lt;result:element&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;The Economics of Technology and Content for Digital TV&lt;/title&gt;
   &lt;/result:element&gt;
&lt;/result:sequence&gt;</pre>

<p>
  The attendees liked this result even less. And they really hated the idea that
  a different tool might produce still a third or a fourth format. They really, really wanted one unique XML output from a query, possibly modulo insignificant details like  the use of empty-element tags or boundary white space. Nobody objected when I turned on Saxon's option to pretty print the output because they didn't view that as a creating a different result from the same query.
</p>


<p>
In XSLT 1.0 all output is XML. A transformation creates a result tree, which can always be serialized as either an XML document or a well-formed document fragment. In XSLT 2.0 and XQuery the output is not a result tree. Rather, it is a sequence. This sequence may contain XML; but it can also contain atomic values such as ints, doubles, gYears, dates, hexBinaries, and more; and there's no obvious or unique serialization for these things. For instance, what exactly are you supposed to do with an XQuery that generates a sequence containing a date, a document node, an int, and a parentless attribute? How do you serialize this construct? That a sequence has no particular connection to an XML document was very troubling to many attendees.</p>

<p>
 Looking at it now, I'm seeing that perhaps the flaw is in thinking of XQuery as like XSLT; that is, a tool to produce an XML document. It's not. It's a tool for producing collections of XML documents, XML nodes, and other non-XML things like ints. (I probably should have said it that way last night.) However, the specification does not define any concrete serialization or API for accessing and representing these non-XML collections. That's a pretty big hole left to implementers to fill.

<hr />
<p>
Word of the day: <dfn>Boundary Whitespace</dfn>. I just discovered this in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery/#id-whitespace">XQuery working draft</a>. It's something we've needed a good term for for a long time. For example, consider this element:
</p>

<pre><code>&lt;name>
  &lt;first>Jada&lt;/first>
  &lt;middle>Pinkett&lt;/middle>
  &lt;last>Smith&lt;/last>
&lt;/name></code></pre>

<p>
Boundary white space is the space between the end of one tag and the beginning of the next, when the text between those tags does not contain anything except white space. Traditionally, this has been called ignorable white space, which is wrong because it isn't ignorable, or white space in element content, which only really applies when a DTD specifies that the element should not contain anything except child elements. 
</p>

<p>
Technically, XQuery also uses this term to include whitespace between tags 
and query braces, as in this example: 
</p>

<pre><code>&lt;name>  
  { for $name in //name/text()
    return $name
} &lt;/name></code></pre>

<p>
However, outside XQueries (which aren't XML documents) the braces have no particular meaning, so in that case I feel justified in saying boundary whitespace occurs exclusively between tags. 
</p>

<p>
Kudos to the XQuery working group for coming up with this. 
I'm not very fond of XQuery itself, but this is at least one useful contribution to emerge from that group.

Tal Rotbart has written 
a <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/dom-result-set/"><code>java.sql.ResultSet</code> DOM Wrapper</a>. Th wrapper
 implements the  DOM <code>Document</code> interface on top of a JDBC result set. The  <code>ResultSetDocument</code> does not contain the actual result-set data and meta-data, but instead contains references to row and column indices. THis makes it very memory efficient, but it requires that the result-set be created with scroll capabilities. However, the wrapper is read-only. 
Interesting idea. I've seen this done with SAX (I've done that <a href="http://cafeconleche.org/books/xmljava/chapters/ch08s05.html">myself</a>.) but this is the first time I've seen this done with DOM. This is published under the LGPL.

There are definitely fewer of these than there used to be.

For myself, I'll be chairing the XML track at Software Development 2004 West

But it's still only one track in a larger show. I'll probably attend WWW 2004, mostly since it's in New York  and therefore convenient and cheap for me. I may submit a poster on XOM design principles or some such. 
And for once I've got a good idea for an Extreme Markup Languages paper far enough in advance that I may be able to get back to Montreal this year. 
But even with all that, it looks like I'll be doing a lot less speaking in 2004 than in the past.

<p>
In my first read-through changes since the last drafts seem fairly minor. 
In the XPath 2.0 draft, "The section entitled "SequenceType Matching" has been rewritten and includes new material on handling of unrecognized types. A new concrete type, <code>xdt:untypedAny</code>, has been introduced, and the <code>isnot</code> comparison operator has been removed. Rules for static and dynamic implementations have been clarified." The XQuery 1.0 changes seem to be limited to these changes in XPath 2.0.
</p>

<p>
The XSLT 2.0 draft states, "there are relatively few technical innovations in this draft, but a substantial amount of editorial revision and clarification. The technical changes of note are the ability of many XSLT instructions (for example, <code>xsl:attribute</code> and <code>xsl:value-of</code>) to use a <code>select</code> attribute or a contained sequence constructor interchangeably, and the introduction of tunnel parameters  which allow parameter values to be passed from a high-level template rule to a low-level rule without being declared in all the intermediate templates. Named sort keys and the sort function have been replaced with a new <code>xsl:perform-sort</code> instruction. There have been revisions to the date formatting functions, aligning them with the <code>xsl:number</code>  instruction and transferring some of the functionality into <code>xsl:number</code> to make it more widely applicable."

The W3C XInclude working group has moved the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-xinclude-20031110">XInclude specification</a> back to last Call working draft to address a couple of concerns that arose during the candidate recommendation. The three major changes are:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Fragment identifiers in URIs are ignored. Instead, XPointers must be placed in a new <code>xpointer</code> attribute. For example, instead of writing <code>&lt;xinclude:include href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/#today"/&gt;</code> you must now write <code>&lt;xinclude:include href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/" xpointer="today"/&gt;</code></li>
<li>There are three new <code>accept</code>, <code>accept-charset</code>, and <code>accept-language </code>
attributes used to perform content negotiation with web servers.  
</li>
<li>The namespace URI is now <code>http://www.w3.org/2003/XInclude</code> instead of 
<code>http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude</code></li>
</ul>


<p>
In my opinion this draft is a step backwards. The <code>xpointer</code> attribute is a really ugly kludge to work around the failure of the XLink working group to define a fragment identifier syntax for XML.
The accept attributes are underspecified, and open up some potential security holes.

The W3C has posted the proposed recommendations of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/PR-xml11-20031105/">XML 1.1</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/PR-xml-names11-20031105/">Namespaces in XML 1.1</a>. These are bad ideas, for reasons I've elaborated before, both <a href="news2002.html#news2002October16">here</a> and <a href="books/effectivexml/chapters/03.html">elsewhere</a>. Allow me to quote myself:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Everything you need to know about XML 1.1 can be summed up in two rules:
</p>

<ol>
	<li><p>
Don't use it.
</p>
</li>
	<li><p>
(For experts only) If you speak Mongolian, Yi, Cambodian, Amharic, Dhivehi, Burmese or a very few other languages and you want to write your markup (not your text but your markup) in these languages, then you can set the version 
attribute of the XML declaration to 1.1.
Otherwise, refer to rule 1.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

</blockquote>


<p>
These drafts do not appear to introduce any substantive changes since the candidate recommendations. In particular a change that would have prohibited line breaks in the XML declaration appears to have been rescinded at the last minute,
probably because that would have required the spec to go back to last call. 
Instead, it is not stated that "The characters #x85 and #x2028 cannot be reliably recognized and translated until an entity's encoding declaration (if present) has been read. Therefore, it is a fatal error to use them within the XML declaration or text declaration." 
</p>

<p>
<strong>Update:</strong> I missed something on my first read through. 
There is a substantive change in the proposed recommendation of XML 1.1
(In direct violation of the W3C's advertised process, I'll note). 
C0 control characters such as BEL and vertical tab are now allowed directly in XML documents. They no longer have to be escaped with numeric character references. Among other effects, this makes it much harder to detect documents which whose encoding declaration is incorrect. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>Update to the update:</strong> It appears this was an an unintentional failure in the editing. Several working group members have told me they meant to forbid literal control characters. They simply forgot to do it.
Expect at least one more draft before the final recommendation. However, even if this problem is fixed, I still think XML 1.1 is a bad idea, and should not be recommended.
</p>


<p>
Comments on both drafts are due by December 5.

The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) working group has released 
candidate recommendations of the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/CR-DOM-Level-3-Core-20031107">Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 Core Specification</a>
and the 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/CR-DOM-Level-3-LS-20031107">Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 Load and Save Specification</a>.
</p>

<p>
Changes since the last draft in the Core specification include
</p>

<ul>
	<li>The <code>DOMStringList</code> interface now has a <code>contains(String str)</code> method. </li>
	<li>The  <code>NameList</code> interface  has <code>contains(String name)</code> and <code>contains(String name, String namespaceURI)</code> methods. </li>
	<li>The <code>TypeInfo</code> class now has an <code>isDerivedFrom()</code> method to tell whether one type is derived from another by  restriction, extension, union, or list. </li>
	<li>In DOMLocator, the <code>getOffset()</code> method has split into  <code>getByteOffset()</code> and <code>getUtf16Offset()</code>. (I really don't approve of this change. It should be a sinngle character offset as in the last draft.)</li>
	<li><code>DOMConfiguration</code> has a new <code>getParameterNames()</code> method that returns a list of all  known parameters.</li>
</ul>


<p>
Of special note with this release, "Given the lack of implementation commitments regarding character normalization, the DOM Working Group considers it "at risk". This affects the "check-character-normalization" and "normalize-characters" parameters defined in the DOMConfiguration  interface in the [DOM Level 3 Core]. The Working Group may remove the parameters before requesting Proposed Recommendation status."
</p>

<p>
In the Load-Save draft, the most substantive change appears to be that the 
optional convenience interfaces <code>DocumentLS</code> and <code>ElementLS</code>  have been removed completely.
Editorially, methods like <code>createDOMParser()</code> and <code>createDOMSerializer()</code> appear to have been renamed 
<code>createLSParser()</code> and <code>createLSSerializer()</code>.
Interfaces like <code>DOMInput</code> and <code>DOMFilter</code> are now 
<code>LSInput</code> and <code>LSFilter</code>. <code>DOMSerializer.writeURI()</code> is now <code>LSSerializer.writeToURI()</code>. <code>DOMInput.getCertified()</code> and <code>setCertified()</code> are now <code>LSInput.getCertifiedText()</code> and <code>setCertifiedText()</code>.

BEA Systems has released  the  <a
href="http://dev2dev.bea.com/technologies/stax/index.jsp">Streaming API for XML
(StAX)</a> along with a reference implementation. This is a
Java-based, pull-parsing API for XML. StAX offers two approaches.
<code>XMLStreamReader</code> and <code>XMLStreamWriter</code> are
a cursor API designed to read and write XML as efficiently as
possible. <code>XMLEventReader</code> and
<code>XMLEventWriter</code> are an iterator API designed to be
easy to use, event based, easy to extend, and allow easy
pipelining. The iterator API sits on top of the cursor API.
</p>

<p>
This API isn't quite rigorous enough for my tastes. It allows implementations to miss well-formedness errors, generate malformed XML, and throw away information wiuthout notifying the client. 
However it's probably the best pull API yet.

XML Benchmark 1.2.2</a>, a C/C++/Java toolset for benchmarking

signature and encryption. Version 1.2.2 adds support for XML Security 1.2 and arabica. </p>

<p> I've learned to treat benchmarks with a 20-pound bag of rock
salt until proven otherwise. However, this product gets at least
one thing right. It lets you plug in "Any valid XML file" so you
can test parsers on the kind of documents you're interested in
rather than on whatever the benchmark vendor has. Most parsers
exhibit wildly varying performance characteristics depending on
the type of XML document (large or small, record-like or
narrative, many attributes or few attributes, etc.). It's not
clear whether or not this parser can test well-formed but invalid
documents. </p>

<p> The W3C Resource Description Framework (RDF) Core Working
Group has published six revised  working drafts: </p>

<dl> 
<dt><a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-rdf-primer-20031010/">RDF
Primer</a></dt> 
<dd> According to the introduction, RDF "is
particularly intended for representing metadata about Web
resources, such as the title, author, and modification date of a
Web page, copyright and licensing information about a Web
document, or the availability schedule for some shared resource.
However, by generalizing the concept of a 'Web resource', RDF can
also be used to represent information about things that can be
identified on the Web, even when they can't be directly
<em>retrieved</em> on the Web.  Examples include information about items available from on-line shopping facilities (e.g., information about specifications, prices, and availability), or the description of a Web user's preferences for information delivery.

RDF is intended for situations in which this information needs to be processed by applications, rather than being only displayed to people. RDF provides a common framework for expressing this information so it can be exchanged between applications without loss of meaning. Since it is a common framework, application designers can leverage the availability of common RDF parsers and processing tools. The ability to exchange information between different applications means that the information may be made available to applications other than those for which it was originally created." </dd>


<dt><a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-rdf-concepts-20031010/">
Resource Description Framework (RDF): Concepts and Abstract
Syntax</a></dt>


<dd> "This document defines an abstract syntax on which RDF is based, and which serves to link its concrete syntax to its formal semantics. This abstract syntax is quite distinct from XML's tree-based infoset [XML-INFOSET]. It also includes discussion of design goals, key concepts, datatyping, character normalization and handling of URI references." </dd>

<dt><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-rdf-mt-20031010/">RDF

<dd> "This is a specification of a precise semantics, and corresponding complete systems of inference rules, for the Resource Description Framework (RDF) and RDF Schema (RDFS)." </dd>

<dt><a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-rdf-syntax-grammar-20031010">
RDF/XML Syntax Specification (Revised)</a></dt><dd> "This document defines an XML syntax for RDF called RDF/XML in terms of Namespaces in XML, the XML Information Set and XML Base. The formal grammar for the syntax is annotated with actions generating triples of the RDF graph as defined in RDF Concepts and Abstract Syntax. The triples are written using the N-Triples RDF graph serializing format which enables more precise recording of the mapping in a machine processable form. The mappings are recorded as tests cases, gathered and published in RDF Test Cases." </dd>

<dt><a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-rdf-testcases-20031010/">RDF
Test Cases</a></dt>

the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/">test
cases</a> themselves which are available separately. </dd> </dl>

<p> 
Changes since the last draft are releatively minor. They include
forbidding the use of control characters in RDF URI references and
weakening the requirement for Unicode Normalization Form C from a 
MUST to a SHOULD. 
Comments on all six are due by November 7. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>
	XForms is an XML application that represents the next generation of forms for the Web. By splitting traditional XHTML forms into three parts‚ÄîXForms model, instance data, and user interface‚Äîit separates presentation from content, allows reuse, gives strong typing‚Äîreducing the number of round-trips to the server, as well as offering device independence and a reduced need for scripting.

	The Mozilla Project has released the <a
	href="http://www.mozilla.org/releases/#1.5">Mozilla 1.5</a>, the open source web browser that supports
	XML, CSS, XSLT, XUL, HTML, XHTML, MathML, SVG, and lots of
	other crunchy XML goodness. It's available for  Linux, Mac OS
	X, and Windows. Besides bug fixes, improvements in 1.5 include,
</p>

<ul>
	<li>A spellchecker for MailNews and Composer</li>
	<li>MailNews can print the attachments list</li>
	<li>An overhauled ChatZilla</li>
	<li>MailNews users can add header lines to every message sent out via a certain identity.</li>
	<li>Users can now mark message as read by date in MailNews.</li>
	<li>Gecko supports setting color for &lt;HR> and &lt;BR></li>

Oracle has released several new versions of their XML Development Kits
on a <a href="http://otn.oracle.com/tech/xml">web site</a>
that's incompatible with about half of the browsers I tested.
First off there's a beta of 10.1.0.1.0A for Windows and Solaris.
New features in this release include:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>XSLT Virtual Machine</li>
	<li>XSLT 2.0</li>
	<li>JAXB Class Generator</li>
	<li>DOM 3.0 Load and Save, and DOM 3.0 Validation support</li>
	<li>SAX Streaming XML Schema Validation Interfaces</li>
	<li>JAXP 1.2 support including W3C XML schema language validation</li>
	<li>New C++ XML APIs that  provide unified DOM support for XMLType</li>
	<li>A New XMLSAXSerializer provides support to handle the SAX output serialization</li>
</ul>

<p>
In addition they've posted a bug fix release in the 9.2 series, version
 9.2.0.6.0. I'm not sure what bugs they've fixed. Certainly none of the ones that prevent XOM from using their parser.
This release is still flunking 39 separate unit tests.
The 10.0 beta does a somewhat better job. It only flunks eight tests, mostly involving incorrectly resolving relative URIs.
For instance, it cannot parse <a href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/redirecttest.xml">this URL</a>. (In fairness, neither can most other parsers, including libxml and all versions of Xerces prior to 2.6.)
The parser also doesn't handle ignorable white space according to the SAX spec.
These XDKs are not open source. Registration is required.

<p> Dennis Sosnoski has posted the third beta of <a
href="http://jibx.sourceforge.net/index.html">JiBX</a>, yet
another  open source framework for binding XML data to Java
objects using your own class structures. It falls into the
custom-binding document camp as opposed to the schema driven
binding frameworks like JaxMe and JAXB. I haven't explored JiBX
in depth, but in general I do find the APIs based on custom
binding documents to be  more flexible and potentially
useful than those based on a schema. Quoting from the JiBX web
site, </p>

<blockquote> 
 <p>JiBX is a framework for binding XML data to Java objects. It
lets you work with data from XML documents using your own class
structures. The JiBX framework handles all the details of converting
your data to and from XML based on your instructions. JiBX is designed
to perform the translation between internal data structures and XML with
very high efficiency, but still allows you a high degree of control
over the translation process.</p>
      <p>How does it manage this? JiBX uses <i>binding definition</i>

documents to define the rules for how your Java objects are converted to
or from XML (the <em>binding</em>). At some point after you've compiled
your source code into class files you execute the first part of the
JiBX framework, the <i>binding compiler</i>. This compiler enhances
binary class files produced by the Java compiler, adding code to handle
converting instances of the classes to or from XML. After running the
binding compiler you can continue the normal steps you take in assembling your
application (such as building jar files, etc.).</p>
      <p>The second part of the JiBX framework is the <i>binding
runtime</i>. The enhanced class files generated by the binding
compiler use this runtime component both for actually building objects
from an XML input document (called <i>unmarshalling</i>, in data
binding terms) and for generating an XML output document from objects
(called <i>marshalling</i>). The runtime uses a parser implementing
the XMLPull API for handling input documents, but is otherwise
self-contained.</p></blockquote>


<p>
This beta mostly fixes bugs and improves the documentation.

Dennis Sosnoski has posted 
<a href="http://xbis.sourceforge.net/">XML Binary Infoset Encoding (XBIS)  0.9</a>, a Java class library for converting XML documents into non-XML binary documents that he claims are faster to parse
and generate be factors of four to eight times. However, I don't believe those numbers for a minute. Sosnoski's benchmarks are comparing apples to oranges. His SAX numbers use parsers that perform well-formedness checking, and the time required to check well-formedness 
are included in the input time. However, 
the XBIS parser relies on an underlying SAX parse to check well-formedness before the XBIS input data is generated; but the XBIS numbers do not include the time spent on this parsing including  well-formedness checking. In fact, I would not be at all surprised that if the well-formedness checking cost were also included in the XBIS numbers, that it would prove slower than real XML parsing. There's also some question about how well optimized and representative the SAX output code is.
 XBIS is published under a BSD license if you want to check it out for yourself.

<p> The W3C Resource Description Framework (RDF) Core Working

<dl> 
<dt><a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-rdf-primer-20030905/">RDF
Primer</a></dt> 
<dd> According to the introduction, RDF "is
particularly intended for representing metadata about Web
resources, such as the title, author, and modification date of a
Web page, copyright and licensing information about a Web
document, or the availability schedule for some shared resource.
However, by generalizing the concept of a 'Web resource', RDF can
also be used to represent information about things that can be
identified on the Web, even when they can't be directly
<em>retrieved</em> on the Web.  Examples include information about items available from on-line shopping facilities (e.g., information about specifications, prices, and availability), or the description of a Web user's preferences for information delivery.

RDF is intended for situations in which this information needs to be processed by applications, rather than being only displayed to people. RDF provides a common framework for expressing this information so it can be exchanged between applications without loss of meaning. Since it is a common framework, application designers can leverage the availability of common RDF parsers and processing tools. The ability to exchange information between different applications means that the information may be made available to applications other than those for which it was originally created." </dd>

<p> I've learned to treat benchmarks with a 20-pound bag of rock
salt until proven otherwise. However, this product gets at least
one thing right. It lets you plug in "Any valid XML file" so you
can test parsers on the kind of documents you're interested in
rather than on whatever the benchmark vendor has. Most parsers
exhibit wildly varying performance characteristics depending on
the type of XML document (large or small, record-like or

 the <code>marquee</code> and <code>blink</code> tags, which can only make one wonder what kind of crack is being smoked in Norway these days. 
Most of the world recognized these tags were bad ideas in 1995.

The OpenOffice Project has posted the fifth release candidate 
of <a
href="http://www.openoffice.org/dev_docs/source/1.1rc5/">
OpenOffice 1.1</a>, an open source office suite for Linux and
Windows that saves all its files as zipped XML. 
I used the previous 1.0 version to write <cite><a
href="books/effectivexml/">Effective XML</a></cite> (which should be arriving
in stores any day now, really. I apologize to anybody who ordered it earlier.
I got my first copy last week, and I don't know why the stores don't have it yet. I am checking with my publisher. :-( ) 
According to the announcement, "The build includes bug fixes and is speedier and more robust. No new features have been introduced since RC4.  Just bug fixes.  We thank you for helping us find and fix them; the work the user community has done has been invaluable.
And you should continue with that work.  RC5 is very close to finished but it really needs for people to test it and find any flaws that may exist.  Please download it, use it, and if you come across something, file a bug report "

CubeWerx has released <a href="http://www.cubewerx.com/cwxml/">CWXML</a>, an open-source C-language library for parsing and generating XML, but really what they're interested in is BXML, yet another binary format that pollutes the XML brand. Guys, what you've created is not XML. Please don't call it that. 
</p>

<p>
A <a href="http://www.cubewerx.com/main/HTML/Binary_XML_Encoding.html">report</a> by Dr. Craig S. Bruce
 makes the usual batch of claims about the non-XML binary 
 format being smaller and faster to parse than real XML. As usual, the actual data tested is way too small to make any real assertions about whether this is true. Unusually, they did include a large narrative document as one of their
two test cases. Most people offering systems like this ignore that completely. 
Regardless though, even ignoring the very limited number of test cases (2),
the numbers in their report don't support their claims. They demonstrate that the size of gzipped XML is smaller than their binary format, and that when you gzip their format the size difference between the two is trivially small. 
They make some bigger claims for speed, but the parse times they're working with are so small to begin with, they really don't matter. Reducing parsing from 0.044 seconds to 0.005 seconds may be an order of magnitude speed up, but it's 
hardly a significant gross savings. 
</p>

<p>
As usual in this field, it appears the researchers have rigged the game by assuming a more homogeneous and thus more easily optimized world than XML actually supports. They only support Latin-1, and it looks probable that they aren't performing all the checks an XML parser is required to perform on characters. They also make the common mistake of encoding numbers as binary  for speed. It's possible to make this work fast for one platform, but every optimization you perform for that platform exacts a comparable slowdown on other platforms with incompatible binary numeric formats. 
</p>

<p>
One thing I'm beginning to think is necessary in this field is a large collection of standard test cases that use the full panoply of XML: DTDs, entity references, CDATA sections, attributes, elements, narrative content, record-like data, recursive data, namespaces, multiple encodings, and more.
This benchmark set would be useful not just for testing binary formats,
but also for testing parser performance. All too often benchmarks in this field are based on just one or two documents. It's rare to see benchmarks 
that cover a broad and deep enough collection of documents to justify themselves.

I'm experimenting with permalinks for the daily news on this site. 
I've written an XSLT stylesheet that extracts the news and stores it into
a daily file. Currently a cron job regenerates the data every hour, which means the link can be broken or out of date for as much as 59 minutes.
I really need a better way to automatically recognize when the main index file has changed and only then regenerate the news extract without manual intervention.  This is all running on Linux. Anyone have an idea?

I've posted <a href="XOM/">XOM 1.0d21</a>, my tree-based streaming API for processing

There are API level changes in this release but most of them are backwards compatible, and the ones that aren't are in fairly obscure areas of the API. Almost all 1.0d20 code should run just fine in 1.0d21 with maybe just a recompile. Details on the web page.

Today is the official release date for <a href="books/effectivexml/">Effective XML</a>.
Later today it will be arriving at fine computer  book stores 
around the country.
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN%3D0321150406/ref%3Dnosim/cafeaulaitA">Amazon</a>, <a href="http://www.bookpool.com/.x/deqgajr14m/sm/0321150406">BookPool</a>, and <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0321150406">Barnes &amp; Noble</a> don't show it in stock yet, but that should change soon.
Amazon in particular generally sells out of their initial shipments of my books very quickly, so you may wish to preorder it. The list price is $44.99, but most stores are 
offering their usual discounts. Amazon is currently 30% off.  BookPool is running a special on Addison-Wesley book right now and has it at 45% off, only $24.95. 
That's the lowest price I've found, and it won't last so order now. 
</p>

<p>
For new visitors to this site who haven't heard of this before, 
<cite>Effective XML</cite> is a collection of guidelines and best practices for using XML. It focuses on using and developing XML applications, with a particular emphasis on aspects of XML that are often misunderstood or misapplied. It follows the path blazed by books like Scott Meyers' <cite><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN%3D0201924889/ref%3Dnosim/cafeaulaitA">Effective C++</a></cite> and Joshua Bloch's <cite><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN%3D0201310058/ref%3Dnosim/cafeaulaitA">Effective Java</a></cite>. 
</p>

<p>
Learning the fundamentals of XML might take a programmer a week. Learning how to use XML effectively might take a lifetime. While many books have been written that teach developers how to use the basic syntax of XML, this is the first one that really focuses on how to use XML well. This book is not a tutorial. It is not going to teach you what a tag is or how to write a DTD. I assume you know these things. Instead it's going to tell you when, why, where, and how to use such tools effectively (and perhaps equally importantly when not to use them).
</p>

<p>
This book derives directly from my own experiences teaching and writing about XML. Over the last five years. I've written several books and taught numerous introductory courses about XML syntax, APIs, and tools. Increasingly I'm finding that audiences are already familiar with the basics of XML. They know what a tag is, how to validate a document against a DTD, and how to transform a document with an XSLT style sheet. The question of what XML is and why to use it has been sufficiently well evangelized. The essential syntax and rules are reasonably well understood. However, although most developers know what a CDATA section is, they are not sure what to use one for. Although programmers know how to add attribute and child nodes to elements, they are not certain which one to use when.
</p>

<p>
Since XML has become a fundamental underpinning of new software systems, it becomes important to begin asking new questions, not just what XML is, but how does one use it effectively? Which techniques work and which don't? Perhaps most importantly, which techniques appear to work at first but fail to scale as systems are further developed? When I teach programming at my university, one of the first things I tell my students is that it is not enough to write programs that compile and produce the expected results. It is as important (perhaps more important) to write code that is extensible, legible, and maintainable. XML can be used to produce robust, extensible, maintainable, comprehensible systems or it can be used to create masses of unmaintainable, illegible, fragile, closed code. In the immortal words of Eric Clapton, ‚ÄúIt's in the way that you use it.‚Äù
</p>

<p>
XML is not a programming language. It is a markup language; but it is being successfully used by many programmers. There have been markup languages before, but in the developer community XML is far and away the most successful. However, the newness and unfamiliarity of markup languages have meant that many developers are using it less effectively than they could. Many programmers are hacking together systems that work, but are not as robust, extensible, or portable as XML promises. This is to be expected. Programmers working with XML are pioneers exploring new territory, opening up new vistas in software, and accomplishing things that could not easily be accomplished just a few years ago. However one definition of a pioneer is someone with an arrow in their back, and more than a few XML pioneers have returned from the frontier with arrows in their backs.
</p>

<p>
Five years after the initial release of XML into the world, certain patterns and antipatterns for the proper design of XML applications are becoming apparent. All of us in the XML community have made mistakes while exploring this new territory, the author of this book prominently among them. However, we've learned from those mistakes, and we're beginning to develop some principles that may help those who follow in our footsteps to avoid making the same mistakes we did. It is time to put up some caution signs in the road. We may not exactly say ‚ÄúHere there be dragons‚Äù, but we can at least say, ‚ÄúThat road is a lot rockier than it looks at first glance, and you might really want to take this slightly less obvious but much smoother path off to the left.‚Äù
</p>

are posted in their entirety on the book's <a href="books/effectivexml/">web page</a>.

</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
This document presents a framework for specifying the semantics for the languages of the Semantic Web. Some of these languages (notably RDF [RDF-PRIMER] [RDF-VOCABULARY] [RDF-SYNTAX] [RDF-CONCEPTS] [RDF-SEMANTICS], and OWL [OWL]) are currently in various stages of development and we expect others to be developed in the future. This framework is intended to provide a framework for specifying the semantics of all of these languages in a uniform and coherent way. The strategy is to translate the various languages into a common 'base' language thereby providing them with a single coherent model theory.
</p>
<p>
We describe a mechanism for providing a precise semantics for the Semantic Web Languages (referred to as SWELs from now on. The purpose of this is to define clearly the consequences and allowed inferences from constructs in these languages.

Style Sheets, level 2 revision 1</a>, that is, CSS 2.1. Unusually
for a new spec, this goes backwards from the previous version. It
focuses on removing properties from CSS2 rather than adding them.

<ul> 
<li>font-stretch</li>
<li>font-size-adjust</li>
<li>Aural
style sheets</li>
<li>text-shadow</li> </ul>

<p> In addition, CSS 2.1 adds  support for media-specific style
sheets, content positioning, table layout, internationalization
and some properties related to user interface. It also "corrects
a few errors in CSS2 (the most important being a new definition
of the height/width of absolutely positioned elements, more
influence for HTML's 'style' attribute and a new calculation of
the "clip" property)." </p>

BEA Systems has posted the proposed final draft of Java
Specification Request (JSR) 173, <a
href="http://jcp.org/jsr/detail/173.jsp">Streaming API for XML
(StAX)</a>, to the Java Community Process. This JSR proposes a
Java-based, pull-parsing API for XML. StAX offers two approaches.
<code>XMLStreamReader</code> and <code>XMLStreamWriter</code> are
a cursor API designed to read and write XML as efficiently as
possible. <code>XMLEventReader</code> and
<code>XMLEventWriter</code> are an iterator API designed to be
easy to use, event based, easy to extend, and allow easy
pipelining. The iterator API sits on top of the cursor API.
</p>

<p> 
There
is a reference implementation bundled with the spec and JavaDoc.
I haven't had time to write code with it yet, or to test the
performance; but overall from the spec and JavaDoc I'd say this
is the cleanest, most XML conformant pull parser I've seen to
date. It's definitely a substantial improvement on XMLPULL.
I'm giving the spec a thorough going over right now. So far my comments are mostly minor editorial issues. A few more major points:
 </p>
 
 <ul>
  <li>The API relies on integer type codes rather than classes
      to type the different kinds of events. This means programs are littered with big switch statements to find out what kind of node they've got. Many methods apply to some nodes but not others. This is a very ugly, un-object oriented design. NekoPull is the example of the right way to solve this problem.  </li>
	<li>The entity resolver doesn't support public IDs.</li>
	<li>Whether or not CDATA sections are reported depends on their location.
	    They should never be reported differently than any other text.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  But that's it. Most of my other comments were even more minor and editorial.
  Overall, this looks like a very nice API.

The  W3C Multimodal Interaction working group has posted the first public working draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-emma-20030811/">EMMA: Extensible MultiModal Annotation markup language</a>. According to the abstract, "this document is part of a set of specifications for multi-modal systems, and provides details of an XML markup language for describing the interpretation of user input. Examples of interpretation of user input are a transcription into words of a raw signal, for instance derived from a speech or pen input, a set of attribute/value pairs describing their meaning, or a set of attribute/value pairs describing a gesture. The interpretation of the user's input is expected to be generated by signal interpretation processes, such as speech and ink recognition, semantic interpreters, and other types of processors for use by components that act on the user's inputs such as interaction managers."

The Writer's Forge has posted 
 <a href="http://writersforge.sourceforge.net/">Bellows 0.20</a>, a
  class library for processing XML with Java
 based on hash maps and lists. 
 The key class is  <code>Datum</code> which represents an XML element.
 Datums have maps of properties, namespaces, and lists of children. One interesting idea I haven't seen in previous APIs is that properties are inherited from the nearest ancestor-or-self with the given property. This would be useful in some cases (Tnink of determing the current value of <code>xml:lang</code> or <code>xml:space</code>) but I'm not sure it's always applicable. 
Bellows includes a custom query language inspired by XPath.

Services Architecture</a> and <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-ws-gloss-20030808/">Web
Services Glossary</a>. </p>


<blockquote> <p>
Web services provide a standard means of interoperating between different software applications, running on a variety of platforms and/or frameworks. This document (WSA) is intended to provide a common definition of a Web service, and define its place within a larger Web services framework to guide the community.
</p>

<p>
The WSA provides a model and a context for understanding Web services and the relationships between the various specifications and technologies that comprise the WSA. The WSA promotes interoperability through the definition of compatible protocols. The architecture does not attempt to specify how Web services are implemented, and imposes no restriction on how services might be combined. The WSA describes both the minimal characteristics that are common to all Web services, and a number of characteristics that are needed by many, but not all, Web services.
</p>

<p>
The WSA integrates different conceptions of Web services under a common "reference architecture". There isn't always a simple one to one correspondence between the architecture of the Web and the architecture of existing SOAP-based Web services, but there is a substantial overlap.
</p>

<p>
We offer a framework for the future evolution of Web services standards that will promote a healthy mix of interoperability and innovation. That framework must accommodate the edge cases of pure SOAP-RPC at one side and HTTP manipulation of business document resources at the other side, but focus on the area in the middle where the different architectural styles are both taken into consideration.

	  the data be extracted with standard XML tools rather than
	  requiring each user to write their own micro-parser for the
	  <code>trace</code> elements. If InkML really can't afford to
	  actually markup the x and y coordinates as x and y
	  coordinates instead of raw text, then one wonders why it's

<blockquote>  The OWL Web Ontology Language is designed for use by applications that need to process the content of information instead of just presenting information to humans. OWL facilitates greater machine interpretability of Web content than that supported by XML, RDF, and RDF Schema (RDF-S) by providing additional vocabulary along with a formal semantics. OWL has three increasingly-expressive sublanguages: OWL Lite, OWL DL, and OWL Full.</blockquote>

<p> Dennis Sosnoski has posted the second beta of <a
href="http://jibx.sourceforge.net/index.html">JiBX</a>, yet
another  open source framework for binding XML data to Java
objects using your own class structures. It falls into the
custom-binding document camp as opposed to the schema driven
binding frameworks like JaxMe and JAXB. I haven't looked at JiBX
in detail, but in general I do find the APIs based on custom
binding documents to be a lot more flexible and potentially
useful than those based on a schema. Quoting from the JiBX web
site, </p>

<blockquote> 
 <p>JiBX is a framework for binding XML data to Java objects. It
lets you work with data from XML documents using your own class
structures. The JiBX framework handles all the details of converting
your data to and from XML based on your instructions. JiBX is designed
to perform the translation between internal data structures and XML with
very high efficiency, but still allows you a high degree of control
over the translation process.</p>
      <p>How does it manage this? JiBX uses <i>binding definition</i>

documents to define the rules for how your Java objects are converted to
or from XML (the <em>binding</em>). At some point after you've compiled
your source code into class files you execute the first part of the
JiBX framework, the <i>binding compiler</i>. This compiler enhances
binary class files produced by the Java compiler, adding code to handle
converting instances of the classes to or from XML. After running the
binding compiler you can continue the normal steps you take in assembling your
application (such as building jar files, etc.).</p>
      <p>The second part of the JiBX framework is the <i>binding
runtime</i>. The enhanced class files generated by the binding
compiler use this runtime component both for actually building objects
from an XML input document (called <i>unmarshalling</i>, in data
binding terms) and for generating an XML output document from objects
(called <i>marshalling</i>). The runtime uses a parser implementing
the XMLPull API for handling input documents, but is otherwise
self-contained.</p></blockquote>

Papers for Software Development 2004 West</a>. This conference will take
place March 15-19, 2003, in Santa Clara. Once again I'll be chairing the XML
track. XML-wise this conference tends to focus on more practical, how-to
sessions rather than a typical XML conference, which runs more advanced
and theoretical sessions.
</p>

<p>
We're looking for sessions that speak to programmers who are not
necessarily XML experts but need to learn how to use SAX, DOM,
namespaces, XSLT, schemas, etc.
We're not as focused on bleeding edge topics and research projects as
the more XML-specific shows. We're looking for ninety minute seminars,
and half-day and full-day tutorials. If you haven't presented at this
show before, you're much more likely to get picked for one or two ninety
minute sessions than for a half or full-day session. We like to get to
know speakers with a smaller session first. Submissions are due by September 5.

This CSS3 module describes the basic structure of CSS style sheets, some of the details of the syntax, and the rules for parsing CSS style sheets. It also describes (in some cases, informatively) how stylesheets can be linked to documents and how those links can be media-dependent. Additional details of the syntax of some parts of CSS described in other modules will be described in those modules. The selectors module has a grammar for selectors. Modules that define properties give the grammar for the values of those properties, in a format described in this document.

</p>

<blockquote>
Presentation levels are integer values attached to elements in a document. Elements that are below, at, or above a certain threshold can be styled differently. This feature has two compelling use cases. First, slide presentations with transition effects can be described. For example, list items can be progressively revealed by sliding in from the side. Second, outline views of documents, where only the headings to a certain level are visible, can be generated.

It is designed for printing from mobile devices, where it is not feasible or desirable to install a printer-specific driver, and for situations were some variability between the device's view of the document and the formatting of the output is acceptable to provide a strong basis for rich printing results without a detailed understanding of each individual printer's characteristics.

The Web architecture is influenced by social requirements and software engineering principles, leading to design choices that constrain the behavior of the Web in order for the system to achieve desired properties: an efficient, scalable, shared information space that will continue to grow indefinitely across languages, cultures, and information mediums. This document is organized to reflect the three dimensions of Web architecture: identification, interaction, and representation.

<p>
	XForms is an XML application that represents the next
	generation of forms for the Web. By splitting traditional XHTML
	forms into three parts‚ÄîXForms model, instance data, and user
	interface‚Äîit separates presentation from content, allows reuse,
	gives strong typing‚Äîreducing the number of round-trips to the
	server, as well as offering device independence and a reduced
	need for scripting. </p>

	<p> XForms is not a free-standing document type, but is
	intended to be integrated into other markup languages, such as

I've posted version 1.0d19 of  <a
href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/XOM/">XOM</a>, my open source
streaming/tree API for processing XML with Java. This release makes a
couple of backwards incompatible changes to <code>NodeFactory</code>. 
<code>makeElement</code> has been renamed
<code>startMakingElement</code>  and <code>endElement</code> has been
renamed <code>finishMakingElement</code>.
<code>startMakingElement</code> behaves the same as the old
<code>makeElement</code>. However, <code>finishMakingElement</code> now
has a slightly different contract. If it returns null, the entire
element is deleted from the tree. It is no longer necessary to
explicitly call <code>detach</code>. If it returns a different element
than the one passed to it, then the old element is deleted from the tree
and the new one is inserted in its place. This is more consistent with
the other methods in this class. Return the node you want added to the
tree, or null for no node at all.
</p>

<p>
The second big change has no API-level impact. By default, the
<code>Serializer</code> class and <code>toXML</code> methods now use
numeric character references to to escape all tabs, carriage returns,
and line feeds in attribute values and all carriage returns in text
nodes. This helps make round tripping more reliable and robust. XOM is
published under the LGPL.

From the bad ideas that wouldn't die department, it seems that
the W3C is planning a "<a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/07/binary-xml-cfp.html">Workshop on Binary Interchange of XML Information Item Sets</a>." 
It's unclear yet whether non-W3C members are welcome. So far they 
aren't, but you can find a <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/pub/wlg/263">little information</a> on Marc Hadley's blog. 
 The problems with binary XML (an oxymoron if ever there was one)
are addressed in several chapters of <cite><a href="books/effectivexml/">Effective XML</a></cite>, most notably <a href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/effectivexml/chapters/50.html">Item 50</a>. 
</p>

<p>
Some  developers 
 either don't believe or don't get XML's value proposition of a compatible, interoperable, editable, text format.  They falsely believe that binary formats are significantly faster or smaller than XML, which is almost never true in practice.
It's true some of the time, especially in the embedded space. For instance, I would not suggest encoding a bitmapped image in XML. However, in those cases no XML-like format will work, binary or otherwise. A format that is simpler than XML is required. Binary encoding the infoset simply doesn't help. 
</p>

<p>
Worse yet, some vendors are deliberately trying to lock developers into their patented, closed, binary, "XML" formats so they can sell their tools. 
The patents probably wouldn't survive through the W3C process, but they still hope to be able to complicate XML enough that programmers will buy their editors and APIs, rather than using simple, free tools like emacs and Xerces like they are now. 
Text XML is too simple to sell tools for, so 
they hope that by making it a binary format they can 
convince programmers to buy their wares. I doubt they'll succeed, but that is the thought process. The binary formats actually already exist, and the market has ignored them with a resounding silence.
They have achieved no traction and no interest in the community.
I suspect these vendors see W3C standardization as a last ditch effort to convince programmers to buy a technology they don't want and don't need. 
</p>

<p>
The vendors and  developers pushing binary XML are a small
minority in the community. 
Unfortunately they're likely to be a huge majority at the workshop and on whatever committee comes out of it. Developers who rightly think that binary XML is an oxymoron and want to kill it won't go to the workshop
or join the working group.
Like other W3C working groups, the binary XML crowd will be packed with true believers who are deaf to the 
claims that its work is fundamentally flawed and needs to be rejected in toto.
They'll insist that we're not making useful comments because we 
refuse to accept their mistaken premises.  Two years down the line we'll be looking at yet another awful W3C recommendation that confuses user, pollutes the XML space, and makes XML much more complicated for everyone. 
</p>

<p>
This needs to be stopped now. This workshop should be cancelled,
or at least not take place under the W3C umbrella.
I don't really care if a group of programmers want to get together to talk about binary data formats, as long as they don't call their formats XML. I'm confident that real XML will triumph over binary formats in the many areas where it is the best solution, and fail in the few areas where it's not, as long as the W3C doesn't pollute the XML brand by claiming it's anything other than Unicode in angle brackets.  
For the same reasons, the
 <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-soap12-mtom-20030721/">SOAP Message Transmission
Optimization Mechanism</a> should be pulled. These are toxic technologies that 
serve no one's interests. 
They significantly compromise the XML  promise of interoperable, interchangeable data that can be processed by a host of free, simple, readily available tools.
The W3C should stand firm that XML is text and nothing but.
There are no alternate serializations for the XML Infoset besides Unicode characters in angle brackets.

Gal Binyamini has posted <a href="http://jxv.sourceforge.net">JXV 0.4</a>,
an open source library that allows Java objects to be given "XML Views",
and for those views to be read back into objects. (This strikes me as a
little more plausible than the other direction in which you start with
an XML document and build a custom Java object around it.) Essentially,
this is another variation of object serialization using XML. JXV
supports SAX input and output and DOM output. According to Binyamini,
</p>

<blockquote>
JXV uses a pluggable architecture which allows XML view factories to be
configured and loaded at runtime. The JXV configuration mechanisms also
leverage XML namespaces to allow the configurations for those different
view factories to be inlined within the JXV configuration file. In this
release, JXV comes pre-configured with view factories for JavaBeans,
collections, array, and "flat objects" such as Strings, primitives, etc.
These factories support a wide variety of configuration options, and are
sufficient for most object models. Future versions of JXV will include
pre-configured support for additional factories. JXV may also release
special-purpose factories (such as ones providing views for RowSets,
ResultSets and other JDBC structures) as extension packages.

	<a

	Services Specification</a>, in the Java Community Process
	(JCP). This basically describes subset of JAXP, JAX-RPC, and
	XML intended for talking to SOAP services from Java 2 Micro
	Edition devices. "The goal of this optional package is to
	define a strict subset wherever possible of the XML parsing
	functionality defined in JSR-063 JAXP 1.2 [2] that can be used
	on the Java 2 Micro Edition Platform (J2ME)". On first reading,
	this draft appears to be substantially more XML-conformant than
	previous drafts.
</p>

<p>
 	The only major problems I noticed were in the SAX subset. Sun
	 is using the confusing, underspecified <code>SAXParser</code>
	 and <code>SAXParserFactory</code> instead of the much cleaner,
	 better specified <code>XMLReader</code> and
	 <code>XMLReaderFactory</code>. They've also removed
	 <code>ContentHandler</code> completely and replaced it with
	 <code>DefaultHandler</code>. Since this requires altering many
	 signature in JAXP, this makes it substantially more difficult
	 to port standard SAX programs to J2ME.

The W3C has posted an initial draft <a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/entities">collection of semi-standard 
character entity declarations</a> for use with XML. 
This is based on MathML 2 and the 
ISO/IEC TR 9573 entity sets.
According to David Carlisle, 
"It is hoped that this _draft_ set of definitions might form the basis of
a shared, compatible set of definitions between different XML languages
so that the current situation where &lt;mo> &amp;assymp; &lt;/mo> changes meaning
if it is copied from a docbook+mathml document to a xhtml+mathml
document might be avoided..."

AOL is jettisoning Mozilla. Apparently they decided it was easier and 
more profitable to collude with Microsoft than compete. 
It has laid off most of the Mozilla developers.
However, the open source Mozilla will continue, now under the auspices of the newly formed <a href="http://www.mozillafoundation.org">Mozilla Foundation</a>, which will rehire several of the key developers.
That's one of the big benefits of open source. Software isn't tied to the whims of one company.
</p>

<p>
The big question mark now is what happens now to Netscape, 
which depends on the Mozilla code base and
still has about 500 employees and a recognized brand. 
AOL gave $2,000,000 to the Mozilla Foundation
as part of the unofficial severance package, so maybe they still recognize some value there.
I've heard rumors that AOL is in the process 
of removing the Netscape logo from various buildings. Anyone in Mountain View want to confirm  or deny?

The OpenOffice Project has posted the first release candidate 
of <a
href="http://www.openoffice.org/dev_docs/source/1.1rc/index.html">
OpenOffice 1.1</a>, an open source office suite for Linux and
Windows that saves all its files as zipped XML. 
I used the previous 1.0 version to write <cite><a
href="books/effectivexml/">Effective XML</a></cite>. New features
since the previous  beta include
a "talkback" style crash reporter,
support for drawing objects in headers and footers,
an example XSLT filter for Office 2003 XML format,
support for Microsoft Excel 95 (and older) form controls,
a UNO python bridge that makes Python a first class
	  language for creating UNO components,
	   spell checking dictionaries for UK English  and Italian,
	   hyphenation  for Danish, UK, English, German, and Russian,
	   Bitstream Vera fonts,
	   and improved spelling suggestions using n-gram scoring (whatever that is).
The weakness of the spell checker was one of my major complaints about 
OpenOffice 1.0. I'm much looking forward to this.
New
features in 1.1 since 1.0 include import and export of PDF,
Macromedia Flash, DocBook, several PDA Office file formats, flat
XML and XHTML and complex text layout for languages such as Thai,
Hindi, Arabic, and Hebrew.

<p>
	I've posted one more chapter from <cite><a
	href="books/effectivexml">Effective XML</a></cite> today
	because it has some direct bearing on the <a
	href="http://intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/FrontPage">ongoing
	development of Echo</a>, which seems likely to replace RSS as a
	syndication format for the Web. <a
	href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/effectivexml/chapters/
	13.html">Chapter 13,  Remember Mixed Content</a>, discusses the
	current escaped HTML format used by RSS feeds, and  explains
	part of the reason it's a very bad idea. (The previously posted
	items <a
	href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/effectivexml/chapters/
	14.html">14</a> and <a
	href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/effectivexml/chapters/
	15.html">15</a> are also relevant.) In brief, escaping HTML was
	just an ugly hack to work around the many deficiencies of RSS
	0.9. There is no reason to carry this nasty hack forward into
	the future.
</p>

<p>
	If Echo is going to be an XML format, then it is crucial that
	it not try to violate either the letter or the spirit of
	well-formedness. Embedding malformed markup inside CDATA
	sections is a horrendous idea that makes RSS much harder to
	handle than it should be. Escaping HTML is a constant source of
	trouble for anyone attempting to process RSS with XML parsers,
	XSLT processors, schema validators, and other standard tools.
	Equally importantly, it's completely unnecessary. There is no
	good reason not to simply embed well-formed HTML in the
	appropriate elements such as <code>description</code> or
	<code>content</code>. Continuing to support escaped, malformed
	HTML in Echo will continue to produce fragile systems that
	don't interoperate. Directly including well-formed HTML will
	create a much more robust Web that's easier to process and
	makes life nicer for authors, readers, aggregators,
	syndicators, and all other producers and consumers of Echo
	content.
</p>

<p>
	I'm not the only one who thinks so. <a
	href="http://tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/06/28/Learning"
	>Tim Bray</a> has also weighed in on this topic. Discussion is
	taking place on a <a
	href="http://intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/EscapedHtmlDiscussion"
	>Wiki</a> and on a <a
	href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1500.html">blog</a>.
</p>

<p>
  		From reading  those discussions, I think most people
	  	recognize that escaped HTML is a really horrible kludge.
	  	It's ugly, and it causes problems.
	  	Nonetheless, most people
	  	seem willing to compromise on this. <strong>This is
	  	wrong.</strong> There must be no compromise here. There is
	  	no excuse for using escaped markup in XML documents. It
	  	must not be allowed. The only legitimate reason to escape a
	  	character like &lt; or &amp;, whether with entity
	  	references, CDATA sections, or numeric character references
	  	is because the author really does want the actual &lt; or
	  	&amp; character to be used as text, not markup. Syndicators
	  	who cannot produce well-formed markup should be taught how
	  	to do so, not encouraged to continue in their bad habits;
	  	and until they learn, their feeds should be dropped from
	  	the community. like any other malformed data. Anything less
	  	is not XML. The advantages of using real, well-formed XML
	  	for this are too obvious and too proven to be ignored. the
	  	problems with using pseudo-XML have been made equally
	  	obvious by RSS. The time has long since come to accept XML
	  	fully. Anything less is unacceptable.

I'm pleased to announce that <a href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/XOM/">XOM 1.0d18</a> is now
available.
1.0d18 adds and one major new feature, and this one's way cool: It is now
possible to subclass <code>NodeFactory</code> in order to filter and/or stream
your processing. XOM can now handle documents of effectively
arbitrary size while using  only slightly more memory than the
underlying SAX parser! 
You'll find complete details  on the main XOM page and 
in the JavaDoc for <code>NodeFactory</code>. I've also written
lots of new sample programs that you'll find in the
<code>nu.xom.samples</code> package. Many of them are streaming versions of
earlier, less memory efficient samples.
</p>

<p>
This developed from an idea proposed by John Cowan, based on
Simon St. Laurent's work with MOE. There have been things like
this before, (<code>DOMBuilderFilter</code> in DOM3, MOE, <code>ElementScanner</code> in
JDOM, and of course SAX filters) but I don't think any API has
done quite as neat a job as XOM now does. This is really powerful
stuff. Not only does it make programs faster and much, much
smaller. It makes them much easier to write. For instance, you
can easily throw away all white space only nodes on build so
you're left with only the real content of the document. No more
white space nodes getting in the way of your navigation. I urge
you to check this out. It will radically change how you think
about processing XML.
</p>

<p>
This release is API compatible with 1.0d17. All programs that
compiled in 1.0d17 should still compile in 1.0d18 without any
edits. XOM is published under the LGPL.

Web content accessible to a variety of Web-enabled devices, such
as phones, handheld devices, kiosks, network appliances, etc. By
making content accessible to a variety of devices, that content
will also be accessible to people in a variety of situations.

<p> The design principles in this document represent broad
concepts that apply to all Web-based content. They are not
specific to HTML, XML, or any other technology. This approach was

XML Benchmark 1.2</a> is a C/C++/Java toolset for benchmarking
XML parsers including libxml2, Xerces, Oracle XDK, Expat, RXP,
QT, and Crimson. Benchmarks include parsing (native, SAX, DOM),
DOM manipulation, schema validation, XSL transformation, and XML
signature and encryption. Version 1.2 adds support for XmlSec1,
Apache XML Security for C, J2SE + Java WebServices Developer Pack

<p> I've learned to treat benchmarks with a 20-pound bag of rock
salt until proven otherwise. However, this product gets at least
one thing right. It lets you plug in "Any valid XML file" so you
can test parsers on the kind of documents you're interested in
rather than on whatever the benchmark vendor has. Most parsers
exhibit wildly varying performance characteristics depending on
the type of XML document (large or small, record-like or
narrative, many attributes or few attributes, etc.). It's not
clear whether or not this parser can test well-formed but invalid
documents. </p>

<p> James Clark has released his latest XML invention, the <a
href="http://www.thaiopensource.com/relaxng/nrl.html">Namespace
Routing Language</a> (NRL). According to Clark, "The XML
Namespaces Recommendation allows an XML document to be composed
of elements and attributes from multiple independent namespaces.
Each of these namespaces may have its own schema; the schemas for
different namespaces may be in different schema languages. The
problem then arises of how the schemas can be composed in order
to allow validation of the complete document.  NRL attempts to
solve this problem." NRL can combine schema in  arbitrary schema
languages.  The sample implementation, <a
href="http://www.thaiopensource.com/relaxng/jing.html">Jing</a>,
RELAX NG , W3C XML Schemas, and Schematron; and uses a SAX-based
plug-in architecture that can dynamically add  new schema
languages. Features include: </p>

<ul> <li>"Extension of schemas not designed to be extended.  For
example, suppose you have an schema for XHTML which does not
allow extension, but you want to embed SVG in XHTML.  NRL allows
you to do so without having to add wildcards to your XHTML
schema."</li>

<li>Easier  authoring of extensible schemas.  "Instead of having
to clutter up a schema with wildcards, you can write a simple
schema without wildcards and then use NRL to specify what kind of
extension is allowed."</li>

<li>Transparent namespaces so 
<code>&lt;x>&lt;t:y>&lt;z/>&lt;/t:y>&lt;/x></code> can be
validated like <code>&lt;x>&lt;z>&lt;/x></code>. I can see this
would be useful for XSLT. </li>

<li>Contextual control of extension. For example, if a W3C XML
Schema uses wildcards in different contexts, NRL can control
which namespaces are allowed in each context.</li>

<li>Concurrent validation of particular namespaces or the whole
document against  multiple schemas in different schema
languages</li>

<li>Streaming vaidation</li> </ul>

fixed numerous bugs in the XInclude implementation. XOM may well
be the most correct implementation of XInclude currently
available. It is definitely better than my previous efforts for

<p> Nokia has submitted <a
href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=226">JSR-226, Scalable 2D
Vector Graphics API for J2ME</a> to the Java Community Process
(JCP). Quoting from the JSR, </p>

<blockquote> <p> This specification will define an optional
package API for rendering scalable 2D vector graphics, including
image files in W3C Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format. The API
is targeted for J2ME platform, with primary emphasis on MIDP. The
main use cases for this API are map visualization, scalable
icons, and other advanced graphics applications. </p>

<p> The main target platform of this API is J2ME/CLDC/MIDP. The
API is targeted at CLDC class devices that typically have very
little processing power and memory, and no hardware support for
2D graphics or floating point arithmetic. The API shall allow
utilization of native 2D graphics features of the device when
applicable. </p>

<p> The API should include: </p>


<ul> <li>Ability to load and render external 2D vector images,
stored in the W3C SVG Tiny format.</li>
<li>Rendering of 2D
images that are scalable to different display resolutions and
aspect ratios.</li> </ul> </blockquote>

<p> Last night at the monthly meeting of the New York XML SIG,
David Megginson pointed out that the W3C is schizophrenic. It is
both a research and development organization and a standards
organization; and it often uses its standards wing to attempt to
foreclose competition with its R&amp;D. Think of schemas. </p>

<p> This morning I'm realizing the JCP is like that too. I've
never even seen an SVG API, and hardly anyone is using one, yet
here's Nokia proposing to standardize one (and charge $50,000 +
$20,000 per year for the technology compatibility kit). The
recent <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=225">JSR 225
XQuery API for Java (XQJ)</a> is similar. Both of these are very
good subjects for research. Neither is yet appropriate for
standardization, nor should we assume that whatever products
comes out of these groups' research will automatically be
standardized. </p>

<p> Perhaps what's needed is a more formal R&amp;D organization
for Java where different interested groups like Sun, Apache,
IBM, and Nokia can come together to work on topics of mutual
interest that is <strong>not</strong> a standards body. Perhaps
in the spirit of scientific research it could be a genuinely open
process that doesn't require NDAs and big licensing fees. Such an
organization should  explicitly allow forking and incompatible
implementations as part of the experimental process. If we don't
try different approaches, we won't know which ones work best.
</p>



<p> The EG shall consider possibilities for subsetting from Java
2D API / JSR-209. Where subsetting is not possible, the API
should be efficiently implementable on top of the Java 2D API /
JSR-209. The API should be rich enough to support an SVG Tiny
implementation. </p>

abstract, "CCXML is designed to provide telephony call control
support for VoiceXML or other dialog systems. CCXML has been
designed to complement and integrate with a VoiceXML system.
Because of this you will find many references to VoiceXML's
capabilities and limitations. You will also find details on how
VoiceXML and CCXML can be integrated. However it should be noted
that the two languages are separate and are not required in an
implementation of either language. For example CCXML could be
integrated with a more traditional IVR system and VoiceXML or
other dialog systems could be integrated with some other call
control systems." </p>

<p> W. Eliot Kimber has submitted a <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/NOTE-XIndirect-20030612">note to
the W3C on XIndirect</a>, "a simple mechanism for using XML to
represent indirect addresses in order to augment the core
functionality of XLink and XPointer without requiring either of
those specifications to themselves require support for indirect
addresses. The facilities defined are specifically designed to
meet the requirements for systems that support the authoring and
management of complex systems of documents." </p>

<p> I haven't quite grokked the syntax yet, but it looks
interesting. I think the basic idea is simply that instead of
pointing directly to the document you want to link to, you point
to a holder for the address of that document. That is, this is
the difference between a pointer and a handle (pointer to
pointer). This allows the linked-to resources to change addresses
without updating the  linking resources, as long as you update
the intermediate indirect. </p>

<p> IBM and Oracle have submitted Java Specification Request
(JSR) 225, <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=225">XQuery
API for Java (XQJ)</a>, to the Java Community Process. "This
specification will define a set of interfaces and classes that
enable an application to submit XQuery queries to an XML data
source and process the results of these queries. The design of
the API will also take into account precedents established by
other JSRs, notably JDBC and JAXP." </p>

<p> I have to say I think this is way too soon. XQuery is not
finished yet, and there's virtually no experience with XQuery
APIs in the community. Standardization should wait until there
have been a number of different APIs, and we can begin to see
what works and what doesn't. Otherwise there's a strong risk of
repeating the disastrous experience of JAXP which is causing
problems to this day (and JAXP was standardized much later in the
life of XML than it is now with respect to XQuery). Design by
standard is simply not a good idea. It locks in mistakes and
locks out too many good ideas. IBM and Oracle and whoever else is
interested should design their own APIs for XQuery, outside the
JCP, and only later bring these together in a standards effort if
a common API seems useful. </p>

<p> Sun's released version 1.2 of the <a
href="http://java.sun.com/webservices">Java Web Services
Developer Pack</a> (JWSDP). This bundles togther a number of
XML-related technologies including: </p>

<ul> <li>JavaServer Faces (JSF) v1.0 EA4</li>

<li>XML and Web Services Security v1.0 EA</li>

<li>Java Architecture for XML Binding (JAXB) v1.0.1</li>

<li>Java API for XML Processing (JAXP) v1.2.3</li>

<li>Java API for XML Registries (JAXR) v1.0.4</li>

<li>Java API for XML-based RPC (JAX-RPC) v1.1 EA</li>

<li>SOAP with Attachments API for Java (SAAJ) v1.2 EA</li>

<li>JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library (JSTL) v1.1 EA</li>

<li>Java WSDP Registry Server v1.0_05</li>

<li>Ant Build Tool 1.5.2</li>

<li>Apache Tomcat 5 servlet container</li>

<li>Ws-I Supply Chain Management Sample Application 1.0 EA</li>
</ul>

<p> They're a lot of bug fixes throughout this release. In
addition, "JAX-RPC and SAAJ have been extended to add support for
the WS-I basic profile 1.0 draft"; and there are some new sample
applications. Xerces 2.3 is now the bundled parser. JAXB 1.0.1
has experimental support for RELAX NG schemas. The download is
over 40 MB. Java 1.3.1 or later is required for at least some of
the bundled technologies. You'll need to use the endorsed
standards override mechanism (i.e. jre/lib/endorsed) to install
some of this in Java 1.4.x. Otherwise, the older versions bundled
with the JDK will take precedence. </p>

<p> BEA Systems has posted the first public review draft of Java
Specification Request (JSR) 173, <a
href="http://jcp.org/jsr/detail/173.jsp">Streaming API for XML
(StAX)</a>, to the Java Community Process. This JSR proposes a
Java-based, pull-parsing API for XML. StAX offers two approaches.
<code>XMLStreamReader</code> and <code>XMLStreamWriter</code> are
a cursor API designed to read and write XML as efficiently as
possible. <code>XMLEventReader</code> and
<code>XMLEventWriter</code> are an iterator API designed to be
easy to use, event based, easy to extend, and allow easy
pipelining. The iterator API sits on top of the cursor API. There
is a reference implementation bundled with the spec andf JavaDoc.
I haven't had time to write code with it yet, or to test the
performance; but overall from the spec and JavaDoc I'd say this
is the cleanest, most XML conformant pull parser I've seen to
date. It's definitely a substantial improvement on XMLPULL.
Comments are due by July 4. </p>

<p> The first release candidate of <a
href="http://www.mozilla.org/releases/">Mozilla 1.4</a> is out.
for the usual batch of platforms: Windows, Linux, Open VMS,
Solaris, AIX, HP/UX, and Mac OS X. (In fact, pretty much
everything except Mac OS 9, which the Mozilla Project has
effectively abandoned, much to my annoyance, especially since
their last 1.2.1 release for Mac OS 9 has lots of nasty bugs).
The popular open source web browser supports XML, CSS, XSLT,
XHTML, HTML, DOM Level 1 and Level 2, and JavaScript. Java and
Flash support are available through plug-ins. New  features in
1.4 include dynamic image and table resizing in Composer, smooth
scrolling (disabled by default) and improvements to spam
filtering as well as bug fixes addressing speed, stability,
standards support and website compatibility. Bookmarks now
include a root level folder, the ability to have two differently
named bookmarks pointing at the same location, site icons in the
Bookmark Manager and Bookmarks Sidebar, and labelled separators.
Changes since the beta release are mostly bug fixes. </p>

<p> I've posted version 1.0d15 of <a
href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/XOM/">XOM</a>, my tree-based
library for processing XML with Java that strives for maximum
simplicity and correctness.  The primary focus of this release is
XInclude. I believe that, modulo undiscovered bugs, this is now a
fully conformant implementation of the XInclude Candidate
Recommendation including support for fallbacks, the XPointer
<code>element()</code> scheme, and preservation of base URI
information using <code>xml:base</code> attributes. There are 24
unit tests for XInclude added in this release as well to try to
keep the undiscovered bugs to a minimum. </p>

<p> There were a couple of other minor improvements in this
release as well. The <code>Element.getChildElements(String name,
String namespaceURI)</code> now allows a null or empty string
local name to stand for any local name, so you can use this
method to get all elements in a certain namespace.
<code>Serializer</code> no longer wraps and indents text when
<code>xml:space="preserve"</code>, regardless of the setting of
indents and maxlength. This release should be completely
compatible with code written against 1.0d14. You should not even
need to recompile existing programs. </p>

<p> I've posted version 1.0d14 of <a
href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/XOM/">XOM</a>, my tree-based
API for processing XML with Java. XOM strives for maximum
simplicity and absolute correctness. This release has undergone
extensive profiling and optimization for both memory footprint
and speed. It is much faster and the objects created are much
smaller. Speed and space wise it should now be competitive with
other tree-based APIs liker DOM and JDOM. API level changes since
1.0d11 (the last one I announced here) are fairly minor. They
include: </p>

<ul> <li>The beginnings of a new <code>nu.xom.benchmark</code>
package, though it's not even close to stable yet. None of the
classes in here are public, but you can run the programs to get
some rough timing measurements. (Timing was actually done using a
profiler running sample applications, not this package. However,
in the future I'd like to automate this more.)</li>
<li><code>Element.insertChild(String, int)</code> now throws a
<code>NullPointerException</code> if the first argument is
null.</li>
<li>The <code>insertBefore</code> and
<code>insertAfter</code> methods have been removed  from
<code>ParentNode</code>.</li>
<li>The serializer now recognizes
the IBM037 encoding (a.k.a. CP037, EBCDIC-CP-US, EBCDIC-CP-CA,
EBCDIC-CP-WA, EBCDIC-CP-NL, and CSIBM037).</li>
<li>If the
serializer's line separator is set, then all line separators are
changed to that separator on output. If the line separator is not
explicitly set, then all line breaks in source text are preserved
as is.</li>
<li>The arguments to <code>insertChild</code> (and
<code>checkInsertChild</code> and <code>checkRemoveChild</code>)
have been reversed. These methods are now:

<pre><code>public void insertChild(Node child, int position)
protected void checkInsertChild(Node child, int position)
protected void checkRemoveChild(Node child, int position)
</code></pre>

</li>

<li>The <code>removeChild</code> methods now return the
<code>Node</code> they remove:

<pre><code>public Node removeChild(int position) public Node
removeChild(Node child) </code></pre> </li>
<li>The
<code>Builder</code> method

<p><code>public Document build(String document, String baseURI)
</code></p>

is now declared to throw an <code>IOException</code> like the
other <code>build()</code> methods</li>

<li>The <code>equals()</code> and <code>hashCode()</code> methods
were removed from the <code>XSLTransform</code> class. </li>
<li>Several additional methods in Element were marked final:
<code>getAttributeCount()</code>, <code>getNamespacePrefix(int
index)</code>, <code>removeChildren()</code>, and
<code>getAttribute(int)</code>. </li>

</ul>

<p> In addition, the unit tests have been expanded significantly,
which resulted in the detection and elimination of numerous bugs.
More details about all of this are on the <a

<p> The  W3C Device Independence Working group has posted the
first  public working draft of <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-cpc-req-20030510/">Core
Presentation Characteristics: Requirements and Use Cases</a>.
</p>

<blockquote> <p> The intended purpose of the Core Presentation
Characteristics recommendation will be to define a common set of
presentation properties or attributes that: </p>


<ul> <li>can be reused in different delivery context
vocabularies</li>
<li>share common semantics  </li>
<li>simplify
the task of interpreting these attributes when adapting or
authoring content for presentation in different delivery
contexts</li> </ul>

<p> Therefore, the scope of the Core Presentation Characteristics
definitions is restricted to attributes that are 'core' for the
'presentation' of web content.  A more thorough explanation of
the meaning of these two terms is presented below. </p>

<p> <strong>Presentation</strong> characteristics are those
properties that define some aspects of the way in which content
may be presented to a user of an access mechanism.  Presentation
characteristics are directly related to the presentation model
being used. For example, when rendering some HTML with CSS visual
styling, CSS defines a presentation model which includes, for
example, the visual area within which the presentation is to be
made, and the fonts with which text can be rendered. Similarly,
when requesting an image to be rendered as part of a
presentation, there is a presentation model which includes the
image size and resolution at which it is to be displayed. For an
audio presentation of some text using a text-to-speech model, the
presentation model may include the available voices with which
the text can be rendered. </p>

<p> <strong>Core</strong> presentation characteristics are those
that are relevant to almost every device using a particular
presentation model. This excludes from the core any attributes
that are specific to only a small subset of devices using a given
presentation model. </p>

to provide a common definition of a Web service, and define its
place within a larger Web services framework to guide Web
services product implementers, Web services specification
authors, Web services application developers, and Web services
students. </p>

<p> The WSA provides a model and a context for understanding Web
services, and a context for placing Web services specifications
and technologies into relationships with each other and with
other technologies outside the WSA. The WSA promotes
interoperability through the definition of compatible protocols.
The architecture does not impose any requirements on the
implementation of services, and imposes no restriction on how
services might be combined. The WSA describes both the minimal
characteristics that are common to all Web services, and a number
of characteristics that are needed by many, but not all, Web
services. </p> </blockquote>

<p> The W3C CSS working group has published two new and four
updated Cascading Style Sheets Level 3 (CSS3) draft
specifications: </p>

<dl> <dt><a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-css3-content-20030514">CSS3
Generated and Replaced Content Module</a></dt>

<dd>This first public working draft "describes how to insert and
move content around a document, in order to create footnotes,
endnotes, section notes. Inserted content can also introduce
counters and strings, which can be used for running headers and
footers, section numbering, and lists. Finally, techniques for
declaring replaced images, as well as scaling and cropping them
using CSS, are described."</dd>

<dt><a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-css3-speech-20030514">CSS3
Speech Module</a></dt>

<dd>This  first public working draft defines CSS properties used
when documents are read out loud. These include
<code>voice-volume</code>,  <code>voice-balance</code>,
<code>speak</code>, <code>pause-before</code>,
<code>pause-after</code>,  <code>pause</code>,
<code>cue-before</code>, <code>cue-after</code>,
<code>cue</code>, <code>voice-rate</code>,
<code>voice-family</code>, <code>voice-pitch</code>,
<code>voice-pitch-range</code>, <code>voice-stress</code>,
<code>voice-duration</code>, <code>phonemes</code>,
<code>@phonetic-alphabet</code>, and <code>interpret-as</code>.
</dd>

<dt><a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/CR-css3-text-20030514">CSS3 Text
Module</a></dt>

<dd>This Candidate Recommendation defines text formatting
properties like <code>text-align</code> and
<code>white-space</code>.  Many of these were already present in
CSS2, but lots of new ones have been added, especially for East
Asian and bidirectional text. </dd>

<dt><a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/CR-css3-ruby-20030514">CSS3 Ruby
Module</a></dt>

<dd>This candidate recommendation  describes properties for the

to indicate pronunciation. </dd>

<dt><a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/CR-css3-color-20030514">CSS3
Color Module</a></dt>

<dd>This candidate recommendation describes  properties such as
<code>color</code>, <code>color-profile</code>, and
<code>opacity</code>.</dd>

<dt><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/CR-css-tv-20030514">CSS TV
Profile 1.0</a></dt>

<dd>This second candidate recommendation "defines a subset of
Cascading Style Sheets Level 2 and CSS3 Module: Color
specifications tailored to the needs and constraints of TV
devices." The change is that the <code>opacity</code> property
now simply accepts a number. Tehre is no longer a priority
argument.</dd> </dl>

<p> The first beta of <a
href="http://www.mozilla.org/releases/">Mozilla 1.4</a> is out.
for the usual batch of platforms: Windows, Linux, Open VMS, and
Mac OS X. (in fact, pretty much everything except Mac OS 9, which
the Mozilla Project has effectively abandoned, much to my
annoyance, especially since their last 1.2.1 release for Mac OS 9
has lots of nasty bugs). The popular open source web browser
supports XML, CSS, XSLT, XHTML, HTML, DOM Level 1 and Level 2,
and JavaScript. Java and Flash support are available thorugh
plug-ins. New  features in 1.4 include dynamic image and table
resizing in Composer, smooth scrolling (disabled by default) and
improvements to spam filtering as well as bug fixes addressing
speed, stability, standards support and website compatibility.
Bookmarks now include a root level folder, the ability to have
two differently named bookmarks pointing at the same location,
site icons in the Bookmark Manager and Bookmarks Sidebar, and
labelled separators. New features since the alpha release
include: </p>

<ul> <li>Mozilla on Windows now has support for NTLM
authentication. This enables Mozilla to talk to MS web and proxy
servers that are configured to use "windows integrated
security".</li>
<li>  Users can now specify "blank page," "home
page," or "last page visited" for each of first window, new
window and new tab.</li>
<li>Users can now specify default font,
size and color for HTML mail compose.</li>
<li>Mozilla Mail now
has CRAM-MD5 and DIGEST-MD5 AUTH support.</li>
<li>"Launch file"
after downloading has been enabled for .exe files.</li>
<li>Proxy
auto-config (PAC) failover has been implemented.</li> </ul>

<p> One feature that is still sorely lacking from this release
(or any other) is the ability to load normally blocked images
into a page on  page by page basis. This would be useful on web
sites that serve legitimate, non-ad images from other servers
than the main page, soch as www.apple.com, www.officemax.com, and
www.amazon.uk. This was available in Mosaic 1.0. It's shocking
that it isn't available in Mozilla 10 years later. </p>

<p> The W3C  XML Protocol Working Group has published four
proposed recommendations of SOAP 1.2: </p>

<ul> <li><a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/PR-soap12-part0-20030507/">SOAP
Version 1.2 Part 0: Primer</a> </li>
<li><a

Version 1.2 Part 1: Messaging Framework</a> </li>

href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/PR-soap12-testcollection-20030507
/">SOAP Version 1.2 Specification Assertions and Test
Collection</a> </li> </ul>

<p> The URIs for various parts of SOAP are now of the form
http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap/bindings/HTTP/,
http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap/mep/request-response/, etc. I'm a
little surprised they're still month based at this late date.
Otherwise I haven't been following this closely enough to say
what's changed. </p>

<p> One thing I just noticed (Not sure if this has been in
previous drafts or not. OK, I found it in the last draft. This is
not new, but it was not previously spelled out nearly as
clearly.) is that "Comment information items MAY appear as
children and/or descendants of the [document element] element
information item but not before or after that element information
item". In other words SOAP messages can't contain comments in the
prolog or epilog. What exactly, is the point of this? The
subsetting just keeps getting more and more extreme. </p>

<p> The W3C XHTML working group has published a <a

incompatible version of HTML that incorporates XFrames, XForms,
and lots of other crunchy XML goodness. However, XLink is not yet
included and may never be. (The HTML Working Group are extreme
XLink skeptics.) "This version includes an early implementation
of XHTML 2.0 in RELAX NG [RELAXNG], but does not include the
implementations in DTD or XML Schema form." (It's interesting
that even the W3C working groups are starting to prefer RELAX
NG.) Otherise, it's not immediately obvious to me what's changed
or added in this draft. </p>

<p> <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-xslt-xquery-serialization-
20030502/">XSLT 2.0 and XQuery 1.0 Serialization</a> is a new
working draft based on material that was previously part of the
XSLT 2.0 spec. It describes how to convert an XPath 2.0 data
model into an XML document, document fragment, HTML, plain text,
or other formats. </p>

<p> Changes to XPath 2.0 in these drafts include: </p>

<ul> <li>Elements and attributes can be selected by their type as
well as by their name. For example, <code>element(Person,
surgeon)</code> matches all <code>Person</code> elements whose
type is surgeon.  <code>element(*, Person)</code> matches all
elements whose type is Person, regardless of element name. </li>
<li>A "validation mode" (strict, lax, or skip) has been added to
the validate expression.</li>
<li> The value comparison operators
 are now transitive. </li>
<li> The syntax of the "cast" and
"treat" expressions has changed so that the operator and target
type follow the operand expression. For example, XPath now uses 
<code>5 cast as decimal</code> instead of the old syntax
<code>cast as decimal 5</code></li>
<li>   Comment delimiters
have been changed from <code>{-- --}</code> to <code>(:
:)</code>.</li>
<li> This draft uses the namespace URI
http://www.w3.org/2003/05/xpath-datatypes (mapped to the prefix
<code>xdt</code>) for the four primtive types defined in the
XPath data model but not the W#C XML Schema Language.</li>
<li>
Two new simple types, <code>xdt:untypedAtomic</code> and
<code>xdt:anyAtomicType</code>, have been introduced.</li>
<li>New functions include  <code>round-half-to-even</code>,
<code>zero-or-one</code>, <code>one-or-more</code>, and
<code>exactly-one</code>. In addition, the <code>insert</code>
function is now <code>insert-before</code> and the
<code>document</code> function is now the <code>doc</code>
function.</li> </ul>

<p> Major changes in XSLT 2.0 since the last working draft not
directly related to XPath 2.0  include </p>

<ul> <li>Output elements can  be assigned complex types via
<code>[xsl:]validation</code> and <code>[xsl:]type</code>
attributes on  <code>xsl:element</code>,
<code>xsl:attribute</code>, <code>xsl:copy</code>,
<code>xsl:copy-of</code>, and literal result elements.</li>

<li>XSLT instructions can construct  arbitrary sequences of nodes
and atomic values using  <code>xsl:variable</code> and  the new 
<code>xsl:sequence</code> instruction. The
<code>xsl:result</code> element has been eliminated.</li>

<li><code>format-dateTime</code>, <code>format-date</code>, and
<code>format-time</code> functions</li>

<li><code>xsl:text</code> once again works like it did in XSLT
1.0. It can only contain a single text node, and no nested
instructions or literal result elements.</li>


<li>A new  <code>current-grouping-key</code> function enables the
same value to be added to zero or more groups. </li>

<li>The <code>[xsl:]default-xpath-namespace</code> attribute has
been renamed <code>[xsl:]xpath-default-namespace</code>.</li>

<li>It is now a compile-time error for
<code>xsl:call-template</code> to supply a parameter whose name
does not match the name of any parameter declared in the called
template. In XSLT 1.0 the extra parameter was simply
ignored.</li>


<li>An <code>xsl:next-match</code> instruction can find the
second best match (second highest priority) for a template rule.
</li>

<li><code>xsl:character-map</code> replaces
<code>disable-output-escaping</code></li>


<li>New options for  the <code>system-property</code> function
provide information about the conformance levels and features
offered by the processor.</li> </ul>



<p> XQuery changes, beyond those in XPath 2.0, include </p>

<ul> <li>The concept of a "module" has been introduced. A module
may contain a library of functions and variables that can be
imported by other modules. An "import module" clause has been
introduced into the Query Prolog, which is now simply called
Prolog.</li>

<li>Element constructors automatically validate the newly
constructed element.</li>


<li>XQuery now permits two kinds of implementation-defined
extensions, called "pragmas" and "must-understand extensions".
Implementations supporting these extensions must provide a
"flagger" that recognizes whether a query uses a language
extension. </li>


<li>Global variable declarations have been added to the
Prolog.</li>
<li>A version number declaration has been added to
the Prolog.</li> </ul>

<p>
Nitesh Ambastha and  Tahir Hashmi have posted <a
href="http://xqueeze.sourceforge.net/">XQueeze 0.2</a>, yet
another attempt to define a smaller, binary compressed form of
XML. Xqueeze replaces "the long and descriptive identifiers that
are described in XML grammar specifications (DTD, Schema etc.)
with small bit-squences or symbols" defined in a per-document
type data dictionary. Unlike some other XML compression formats,
XQueeze's XQML can be directly generated and parsed (though with
not standard XML tools). </p>

<p> If I'm reading the XQML spec right, they've made the very
common mistake of assuming that documents actually adhere to
their advertised DTDs. They don't seem to provide any mechanism
for handling the case where an undeclared element appears, nor
does XQueeze seem able to handle the very common case of
documents without DTDs (though the latter is announced as part of
plans for a future release.) XQueeze is written in C, and
published under the GPL. </p>

<p> I've posted a preliminary <a

Recommended Reading</a> list from <cite><a
href="books/effectivexml/">Effective XML</a></cite>. This lists
other sources of information about how to use XML well, as
opposed to merely its syntax and processing, so I have not
included more traditional tutorial books about XML such as
<cite>Processing XML with Java</cite> or the underlying
specifications. And I did deliberately omit the draft U.S.
Federal Government guidelines for XML because in many cases I
think it gives bad advice. (I am hearing some scuttlebutt that
the final version may be significantly improved from the draft,
but until I actually see the final version I can't recommend it.)
Thus, the list is relatively short. There hasn't been a huge
amount of work in this space yet. If anyone has additional
suggestions for this list, I'd appreciate hearing about them.

data is required to conform to that structure, and multiple
collections of documents, with varying structures, sizes and
complexities, can easily be generated." This version adds a

<p> The W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group
has posted the second public working draft of <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-WCAG20-20030429/">Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</a>. Quoting from the introduction:
</p>

<blockquote> <p> This document outlines design principles for
creating accessible Web content. When these principles are
ignored, individuals with disabilities may not be able to access
the content at all, or they may be able to do so only with great
difficulty. When these principles are employed, they also make
Web content accessible to a variety of Web-enabled devices, such
as phones, handheld devices, kiosks, network appliances, etc. By
making content accessible to a variety of devices, that content
will also be accessible to people in a variety of situations.
</p>

<p> The design principles in this document represent broad
concepts that apply to all Web-based content. They are not
specific to HTML, XML, or any other technology. This approach was
taken so that the design principles could be applied to a variety
of situations and technologies, including those that do not yet
exist. </p>

support for Java 1.1. </p>

<p> Brillant claims this parser is faster than Xerces and Crimson
(which are known not to be the fastest parsers out there).
However, his benchmarks only test one file, and it's not clear
from his result whether FastParser was used in a mode that
doesn't perform full well-formedness checking. </p>

<p> Dennis Sosnoski has posted the first beta of <a
href="http://jibx.sourceforge.net/index.html">JiBX</a>, yet
another  open source framework for binding XML data to Java
objects using your own class structures. It falls into the
custom-binding document camp as opposed to the schema driven
binding frameworks like JaxMe and JAXB. I haven't looked at JiBX
in detail, but in general I do find the APIs based on custom
bindgin documents to be a lot more flexible and potentially
useful than those based on a schema. Quoting from the JiBX web
site, </p>

<blockquote> <p> The JiBX framework handles all the details of
converting your data to and from XML based on your instructions.
JiBX is designed to perform the translation between internal data
structures and XML with very high efficiency, but still allows
you a high degree of control over the translation process. </p>

<p> How does it manage this? JiBX uses binding definition
documents to define the rules for how your Java objects are
converted to or from XML (the binding). At some point after
you've compiled your source code into class files you execute the
first part of the JiBX framework, the binding compiler. This
compiler enhances binary class files produced by the Java
compiler, adding code to handle converting instances of the
classes to or from XML. After running the binidng compiler you
can continue the normal steps you take in assembling your
application (such as building jar files, etc.). </p>

<p> The second part of the JiBX framework is the binding runtime.
The enhanced class files generated by the binding compiler use
this runtime component both for actually building objects from an
XML input document (called unmarshalling, in data binding terms)
and for generating an XML output document from objects (called
marshalling). The runtime uses a parser implementing the XMLPull
API for handling input documents, but is otherwise
self-contained. </p> </blockquote>

open source Java/XML binding tool in the style of Castor or Zeus"
that sits on top of SAX2. JaxMe provides code generators that
read a W3C XML schema and generate code for parsing conformant

databases and Tamino. It includes an integrated application
framework and a generator for EJB entity beans with bean managed
persistence (BMP). It's based on a reduced subset of the W3C XML
schema language that does not support choices, references, or
recursion. This release adds support for
<code>xs:maxLength</code>, <code>xs:minLength</code>,
<code>xs:enumeration</code>, <code>xs:pattern</code>,
<code>xs:include</code>, and <code>xs:anyType</code> as well as
BLOB and CLOB handling when working with a relational database.

<p> I've posted Chapter 15 from <a
href="books/effectivexml/">Effective XML</a>. <a
href="books/effectivexml/chapters/15.html">Item 15, Build on
structures, not syntax</a> elaborates for the first time in
public my five layer stack for XML processing (inspired by the
five layer TCP/IP network stack). Thinking of XML as a stack of
layers, each of which depends only on the stack below it, makes
the answers to many frequent questions very obvious, clears up a
lot of the confusion in the XML community, and points the way to
more effective API and application design in the future. In brief
the XML stack looks like this: </p>

<table border="1"> <tr><td>Semantics: Objects and data structures
built from the information in the XML document; customized for
the local environment </td></tr> <tr><td>Structures: elements,
attributes, text nodes, processing instructions</td></tr>
<tr><td>Syntax: tags, entity references, character references,
CDATA sections, PCDATA</td></tr> <tr><td>Lexical: Unicode
characters in a sequence</td></tr> <tr><td>Binary: Bytes in a
sequence</td></tr> </table>

<p> This model has been implicit in a lot of XML work. For
instance, in the XML 1.0 specification the BNF grammar mostly
describes the syntax while the well-formedness constraints focus
on the structure. In SAX, the core <code>ContentHandler</code>
class provides the structure, while the  optional
<code>LexicalHandler</code> class reports the syntax. However, I
don't think this stack has really been spelled out anywhere like
this before, and most descriptions of XML processing leave out at
least one of these layers, typically by improperly merging the
semantic layer with the structure layer or the structure layer
with the syntax layer. For instance, there was a recent debate on
xml-dev about whether or not XML was a tree, or if that was just
one way of viewing it. I think the real answer is that it is a
tree if you're looking at the structure layer, but it's a linear
sequence of syntax items (that is, not a tree) at the syntax
layer. And when you get to the semantic layer, anything goes
because it's all local. You can have a tree or a graph or any
other data structure you care to instantiate from the document.
</p>

<p> Different tasks need to operate at different layers, and you
need different APIs for these different layers; just as in
networking you would use a different layer for writing a
traceroute program (based on the IP layer) and a telnet program
(based on the TCP layer). For example, most programs work on the
structure layer, but a source code level XML editor would
probably want to plug into the syntax layer instead. Data binding
APIs expose the semantic layer, but most other APIs expose the
structure layer. Other APIs like SAX, DOM, XOM, and JDOM mostly
expose the structure layer. However, in practice, there's been a
lot of confusion because many APIs mix up pieces of the syntax
layer with pieces of the structure layer. The result has been as
ugly as one would get by mixing bits of IP into a TCP layer
networking API. All comments are appreciated. </p>

<p> I am very pleased to report that the Fibonacci web services
on elharo.com are running again at the original URLs published in
<cite><a href="books/xmljava/">Processing XML with
Java</a></cite>. Thanks to everyone who wrote in with
suggestions. What I ultimately had to do was shut down the Sun
Cobalt Qube and replace it with a stock Red Hat Linux box running
the stock versions of Apache and Tomcat. I never could get the
Qube to a point where it could run standard programs instead of
Sun's special versions that didn't actually let me put the
servlets at the URLs where I needed to put them. </p>

<p> There are a few interesting lessons and thoughts I took away
from this experience. All the difficulty I had in getting these
services up and running in a hopefully stable configuration came
from HTTP, specifically from integrating them with an existing
web server. Generating and processing the XML was trivial by
comparison. It would have been easier to write a simple custom
server that spoke a special purpose protocol which both served
and recieved XML than it was to tunnel this stuff over HTTP. </p>

<p> All of the web services frameworks I've seen address the easy
question: how to generate and process XML. They don't seem to
make any progress on what is in my experience the much tougher
question: how does one integrate this into a web server? I think
they might be solving the wrong problem. Some of this stuff, SOAP
and XML-RPC, probably shouldn't have been tied to  port 80 in the
first place. </p>

<p> This book has been a major undertaking for me. Although it's
relatively short (probably under 400 pages) a lot of effort went
into those pages, and it's not done yet. I've probably put more
effort and time into this book than I did into my typical 1200
page behemoth; but I think it's been worth it. This is going to
be an exciting book, and probably a little controversial. Some
major efforts in the XML community get called out in various
chapters as examples of exactly how not to design good XML, but I
think I can back up my claims, and I hope that future
applications will learn enough from this book not to make the
same mistakes. </p>

<p> I've posted version 1.0d11 of <a href="XOM/">XOM</a>, my
tree-based API for processing XML with Java. XOM strives for
maximum simplicity and absolute correctness. The new feature in
this release is an <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">ANT</a> build
file. This should make it much easier to compile XOM from source.
ANT is not included though. You'll have to download and install
it separately. </p>

<p> There are no API-level changes in this release. All code that
ran before should still run. This release does a few assorted
bugs reported by users. Not surprisingly these all appeared in
the <code>Builder</code> and <code>Serializer</code> classes,
which out of all the classes in XOM are the least well-covered by
unit tests. I've expanded the unit tests to catch these and
related bugs. The unit tests all pass, assuming you use a
non-buggy SAX2 parser. However, if you run the JUnit GUI from the
ANT build file, some confusing class loader issues cause the
more-buggy Crimson to be loaded instead of the less-buggy Xerces.
This breaks four unit tests. Everything should pass if you run
the tests directly instead of from ANT. (That is, type
"<samp>java -Xmx96m junit.swingui.TestRunner
nu.xom.tests.XOMTests</samp>" instead of "<samp>ant
testui</samp>".) If anyone can explain to me how I might fix
this, I'd appreciate it. </p>

<p> Hedzer Westra has
released <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/xmill/">XMill
0.8</a>, a special purpose compression tool for XML data.  It has
been established that XML-based file formats are normally smaller
than the corresponding binary formats, and that after compression
they range from a little smaller to a little bigger than the
compressed binary. However, XMill "is based on a regrouping
strategy that leverages the effect of highly-efficient
compression techniques in compressors such as gzip. XMill groups
XML text strings with respect to their meaning and exploits
similarities between those text strings for compression. Hence,
XMill typically achieves much better compression rates than
conventional compressors such as gzip." </p>

<p> This appears to be a fork of the original <a
href="http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/xmill/">AT&amp;T
XMill</a>. New features in this fork include: </p>


<ul> <li>Repackaging as a thread-safe library with a C++ API
instead of just a command line application</li>
<li>The general
purpose compressor (gzip, bzip2 or ppmdi) can be chosen at
run-time.</li>
<li>Special purpose compressors for base64 encoded
data and  arbitrary-base, and arbitrary length numbers. (I
consider this cheating ince it moves information from the
documents into the code. The user has to tell the compressor
which elements contain such information.) </li>
<li>Unit
tests</li>
<li>An integrity checker to test the integrity of XMI
files.</li> </ul>

<p> XMill is written in C++, and is published under a BSD
license. </p>

<p> Wolfgang Meier of the Darmstadt University of
Technology has posted version 0.9.1 of <a

either the internal, native XML-DB or an external relational
database. The search engine has been designed to provide fast
XPath queries, using indexes for all element, text and attribute
nodes.  The server is accessible through HTTP and XML-RPC
interfaces and supports the XML:DB API for Java programming.
Besides bug fixes, new features in version 0.9.1 include the

DOM manipulation, schema validation, XSL transformation, and XML
signature and encryption. I've learned to treat benchmarks with a
20-pound bag of rock salt until proven otherwise. However, this
product gets at least one thing right. It lets you plug in "Any
valid XML file" so you can test parsers on the kind of documents
you're interested in rather than on whatever the benchmark vendor
has. Most parsers exhibit wildly varying performance
characteristics depending on the type of XML document (large or
small, record-like or narrative, many attributes or few
attributes, etc.). It's not clear whether or not this parser can
test well-formed but invalid documents. </p>

<p> The W3C Voice Browser Working Group has published a new
public working draft of <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-semantic-interpretation-
20030401/">Semantic Interpretation for Speech Recognition</a>.
According to the abstract,</p>

<blockquote> <p> This document defines the process of Semantic
Interpretation for Speech Recognition and the syntax and
semantics of semantic interpretation tags that can be added to
speech recognition grammars to compute information to return to
an application on the basis of rules and tokens that were matched
by the speech recognizer. In particular, it defines the syntax
and semantics of the contents of Tags in the Speech Recognition
Grammar Specification. </p>

<p> Semantic Interpretation may be useful in combination with
other specifications, such as the Stochastic Language Models
(N-Gram) Specification, but their use with N-grams has not yet
been studied. </p>

<p> The results of semantic interpretation are describing the
meaning of a natural language utterance. The current
specification represents this information as an EcmaScript
object, and defines a mechanism to serialize the result into XML.
The W3C Multimodal Interaction Activity is defining a data format
(EMMA) for representing information contained in user utterances,
and has published the requirements for this data format (EMMA
Requirements). It is believed that semantic interpretation will
be able to produce results that can be included in EMMA. </p>

<blockquote> The OWL Web Ontology Language is designed for use by
applications that need to process the content of information
instead of just presenting information to humans. OWL facilitates
greater machine readability of Web content than that supported by
XML, RDF, and RDF Schema by providing additional vocabulary along
with a formal semantics. OWL has three increasingly-expressive
sublanguages: OWL Lite, OWL DL, and OWL Full. </blockquote>

href="http://www.mozilla.org/releases/">Mozilla 1.3</a> (and the
day after I burnt all the CDs for <cite>Hands-On XSLT</cite> with
Mozilla 1.2, damn it!). The popular open source web browser
supports XML, CSS, XSLT, XHTML, HTML, DOM Level 1 and Level 2,
and JavaScript. Java and Flash support are available thorugh
plug-ins. Version 1.3 is available for Windows, Linux, Open VMS,
AIX, Solaris, Irix, HP/UX, and Mac OS X. Mac OS 9 is not
supported, which is disappointing, especially since Mozilla 1.2.1
was extremely unstable on Mac OS 9; and I was hoping for a
release that would stop the frequent crashing in that
environment. Version 1.3 adds  junk-mail filtering, image
auto-sizing, an API for rich text editing in webpages, newsgroup
filters, dynamic profile switching, and many other small new
features and bug fixes. </p>

<p> The Mozilla Project has
also posted version <a
href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/camino/releasenotes.html">
0.7</a> of <a
href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/camino/">Camino</a> (nee
Chimera), a small footprint, native Cocoa Mac OS X web browser
based on Mozilla's Gecko layout engine that includes lots of XML
support. Unlike Mozilla, this is only a browser: no e-mail
client, news reader, chat program, or dog walker. Besides the
name, which was changed for trademark reasons, changes in 0.7
include a new Download Manager with auto-download and
auto-dispatch, compatibility with URL Manager Pro, a Page Text
Encodings menu, Global History in the sidebar, new toolbar
buttons, dragging of images and links to the desktop, Shockwave
Directory support, Rendezvous support for local FTP and web
servers, and proxy auto-config.

<p> I've posted version 1.0d11 of my <a

<li>All three XIncluders now maintain

<p> The  IETF has released three new RFCs covering
internationalized domain names: </p>


<ul> <li><a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3490.txt">RFC 3490 :
Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications (IDNA)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3491.txt">RFC 3491 :
Nameprep: A Stringprep Profile for Internationalized Domain 
Names (IDN)</a></li>
<li><a
href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3492.txt">RFC 3492 : Punycode: A
Bootstring encoding of Unicode for Internationalized  Domain
Names in Applications (IDNA)</a></li>

</ul>

<p> Eventually, this will enable domain names to contain
characters like &omicron; and &Iota;. You thought you already
could use these characters in domain names? Actually, no you
can't. You see those are the Greek letters omicron and capital
iota, which, unless you look very closely, are pretty much the
same as the ASCII letters o and l. (How similar they are depends
on which fonts you're using. For some people, they won't even be
close; but on many systems it's plenty good enough to fool
someone; certainly good enough to get a casual user to enter
their password into a form on paypa&Iota;.com) There are many
more spoof buddies like this throughout Unicode. For instance,
Chinese companies may well want to register both simplified and
traditional forms of their names. </p>

<p> These security issues were raised repeatedly with the working
groups  by multiple people throughout the process, myself
included; and solutions were proposed that allowed
internationalized domain names while avoiding much of the damage
these proposals cause; but the working group consistently refused
to address them in any meaningful way. The most common response
was that since it was already possible to spooh apple.com with
app1e.com, it didn't matter that they were making the problem
about a thousand times worse. I think I may register
&iota;etf.org now, and see what happens. :-) </p>

<p> In any case, the onus now falls on the registrars not to
register spoofed domain names (but given that app1e.com and
MICROS0FT.COM are already registered, while the registrars are
busily taking everyone's money while disclaiming responsibility
for anything, I don't hold out much hope for that. Application
software can attempt to watch out for such fraud, but this is
going to affect every bit of software that displays or activates
a URL. There's really no hope of avoiding the problem now. I
predict that no later than 2004 there'll be some major frauds
reported perpetrated through this vector. </p>

<p> Sun has submitted <a
href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=206">Java Specification
request 206 (JSR-206) Java API for XML Processing (JAXP) 1.3</a>
to the Java Community Process. The main goal of this release is
to bring JAXP up to spec with XML 1.1, Namespaces 1.1, DOM Level
3, and SAX 2.0.1. It also suggests: </p>


<ul> <li>Standardizing some additional classes such as QName and
NamespaceContext that are already being used by other
specifications such as JAXB.</li>
<li>Protecting against the
billion laughs attack</li>
<li>Adding an XPath query API for DOM
objects</li>
<li>Supporting grammar pre-parsing and caching</li>
<li>XInclude support</li> </ul>

<p> Personally, I'd prefer the working group spend more time on
more carefully specifying what the methods already in the
<code>javax.xml</code> packages actually do before they worry
about new features. A lot of the methods there are grossly
underspecified. For instance, how does the identity transform
behave when transforming a DOM <code>Document</code> object that
has namespaced elements but no namespace declaration attributes?
Does a <code>SAXResult</code> invoke <code>startDocument()</code>
and <code>endDocument()</code> in its <code>ContentHandler</code>
when the transform  only produces a document fragment? Comments
are due by March 17. </p>

<p> The W3C Web Services Description Group has published a
new working draft of <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-wsdl12-20030303">Web Services
Description Language (WSDL) Version 1.2</a>. Quoting from the
introduction: </p>

<blockquote> <p>Web Services Description Language (WSDL) provides
a model and an XML format for describing Web services. WSDL
enables one to separate the description of the abstract
functionality offered by a service from concrete details of a
service description such as "how" and "where" that functionality
is offered.</p>

<p>This specification defines a language for describing the
abstract functionality of a service as well as a framework for
describing the concrete details of a service description. The
companion specification, <em>WSDL Version 1.2: Bindings</em>
[<cite>WSDL 1.2 Bindings</cite>] defines a language for
describing such concrete details for SOAP 1.2 [<cite>SOAP 1.2
Part 1: Messaging Framework</cite>], HTTP [<cite>IETF RFC
2616</cite>] and MIME [<cite>IETF RFC 2045</cite>].</p>

<p>WSDL describes Web services starting with the
<em>messages</em> that are exchanged between the service provider
and requestor. The messages themselves are described abstractly
and then bound to a concrete network protocol and message format.
A message consists of a collection of typed data items. An
exchange of messages between the service provider and requestor
are described as an <em>operation</em>. A collection of
operations is called a <em>port type</em>. A <em>service</em>
contains a collection of <em>ports</em>, where each port is an
implementation of a portType, which includes all the concrete
details needed to interact with the service.</p> </blockquote>

<p> Sun's released the  <a
href="http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/final/jsr031/
index.html">Java Architecture for XML Binding 1.0 (JAXB)</a>
specification, reference implementation, API docs, and technology
compatibility kit. JAXB compiles an XML schema into one or more
Java classes. (First mistake: JAXB assume there's a schema.
Second mistake: It assumes the schema is written in the W3C XML
Schema Language.) JAXB can unmarshal schema-valid XML into Java
objects; read, update and validate the Java objects against  the
schema, and write the result back out as XML. Unfortunately, this
API is fundamentally flawed. The misconception that cripples it
appears on the very first page of the spec: </p>

<blockquote> An XML document need not follow any rules beyond the
well-formedness criteria laid out in the XML 1.0 specification.
To exchange documents in a meaningful way, however, requires that
their structure and content be described and constrained so that
the various parties involved will interpret them correctly and
consistently. This can be accomplished through the use of a
<dfn>schema</dfn>. A schema contains a set of rules that
constrains the structure and content of a documents components,
<em>i.e.</em>, its elements, attributes, and text. A schema also
describes, at least informally and often implicitly, the intended
conceptual meaning of a documents components. A schema is, in
other words, a specification of the syntax and semantics of a
(potentially infinite) set of XML documents. A document is said
to be <em>valid</em> with respect to a schema if, and only if, it
satisfies the constraints specified in the schema. </blockquote>

<p> Documents can in fact be exchanged meaningfully without
schemas, and without correct and consistent interpretation. You
may, after all, want to do something very different with a
document than I want to do with it. You might want
<code>&lt;month>January&lt;/month></code> to be a date and I
might want it to be a string, a search key, or even a proper
name. Your use and understanding  of the data need not affect my
use or unserstanding of the same data. Nor do documents need to
be valid in order to be useful. For instance, the page you're
reading now claims to be XHTML, but it's not valid according to
the XHTML DTD. Did you notice? Do you care? JAXB's view of XML is
far too limited. The mind set and preconceptions that led to JAXB
were formed in the realm of compiled, binary systems that operate
inside a single computer. The heterogenous, networked world of
XML documents is far broader than that. JAXB is limited to the
impoverished domain of single systems where everything agrees on
what documents mean, how they're formed, and what should be done
with them. </p>

<p> Hmmm, looks like there's another bug in the RSS feed today.
The 1.0.6 in the Gnosis Utils version number tripped the sentence
end detection algorithm early. That shouldn't have happened. It
only looks for a period followed by a space. I'm looking into
this. </p>

<p> OK, I found the bug. I wasn't recognizing the colon as a
sentence ender, so the algorithm fell back to the first period.
It will be fixed with the next update at 10:00. It occurs to me
that I should probably test my algorithm against all the news
from the last year to see what else it's missing. However before
I can do that, I'd have to turn all the old news into well-formed
XHTML too, a non-trivial task. I'd love to use more XML tools on
this site, but a lot of the systems in place predate XML by a
couple of years so they use old, ugly regular expression and
comment hacks and the like. I really should knuckle down and
replace all that junk with clean XML based tools. </p>

<p> The W3C has posted a note on XML Advanced Electronic
Signatures (XAdES). According to the abstact, XAdES </p>

<blockquote> <p> extends the IETF/W3CXML-Signature Syntax and
Processing specification [XMLDSIG] into the domain of
non-repudiation by defining XML formats for advanced electronic
signatures that remain valid over long periods and are compliant
with the European "Directive 1999/93/EC of the European
Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 1999 on a Community
framework for electronic signatures" [EU-DIR-ESIG] (also denoted
as "the Directive" or the "European Directive" in the rest of the
present document) and incorporate additional useful information
in common uses cases. This includes evidence as to its validity
even if the signer or verifying party later attempts to deny
(repudiates) the validity of the signature. </p>

<p> An advanced electronic signature aligned with the present
document can, in consequence, be used for arbitration in case of
a dispute between the signer and verifier, which may occur at

<li>A new NameList interface defines a read-only
list of names and namespace URIs</li>
<li>A new
<code>DOMImplementationList</code> interface defines a read-only
list of DOMImplementations.  There's also a new
<code>DOMImplementationSource</code> interface and a
<code>getDOMImplementations</code> method in the
<code>Document</code> interface. Together with the

possible to load DOM implementations in an implementation
independent fashion. </li>
<li>The <code>getInterface</code>
method in <code>Node</code> has been renamed
<code>getFeature</code>.</li>
<li><code>schemaType</code> has
been renamed <code>schemaTypeInfo</code></li>
<li><code>TypeInfo.name</code> has been changed to 
<code>TypeInfo.typeName</code></li>
<li><code>TypeInfo.namespace</code> has been changed to
<code>TypeInfo.namespaceURI</code></li>
<li>The <code>Attr</code>
interface has an <code>isId</code>  method.</li>
<li>The
<code>setIdAttribute</code>, <code>setIdAttributeNS</code>, and
<code>setIdAttributeNode</code> methods in Element can now be
used for non-ID attributes. (Would somebody please explain to me
what the point of this is? DOM just keeps getting more baroque
with each release. By my count, the Element interface now has
seven separate methods to add an attribute to an element, all of
which do pretty much the same thing. <a href="/XOM/">XOM</a>
manages to get by with a paltry one method for adding attributes
to elements. ) </li>
<li>parameters: isId.</li>
<li>Parameters
for DOMConfiguration are now objects instead of booleans</li>

<ul> <li> The optional "<code>ElementLS</code> interface provides
a convenient mechanism by which the children of an element can be
serialized to a string, or replaced by the result of parsing a
provided string." </li>
<li>Load and Save is now in sync with the
latest Core draft, including the  <code>DOMConfiguration</code>
interface.</li>
<li><code>DOMBuilder</code> has async and busy

class library that "applies <i>XPath</i>  expressions to graphs
of objects of all kinds: JavaBeans, Maps, Servlet contexts, DOM
etc, including mixtures thereof." New features in version 1.1
include: </p>

<ul> <li> JDOM support</li>
<li>  A getNode() method that returns
the raw value without converting it to a
<code>String</code>.</li>
<li>  DynaBeans support.</li>
<li>   
The <code>format-number()</code> function from  XSLT.</li> </ul>

<p> Changes since the first beta are mostly bug and build fixes.

<p> I've fixed the XSLT stylesheet that produces the
RSS feed for this site so that it is no longer tripped up by
middle initials. As is very often the case with complicated XSLT
problems, the answer involved named templates, parameters, and
recursion. Several people suggested regular expression based
solutions, but that's way too hard to implement in XSLT 1.0.
Right now I'm just checking to see if the character two
characters before the period is  a space; and, if it is,
reinvoking the same template on the remainder of the first
paragraph to extract the rest of the sentence. </p>

<p> The period after the middle initial in in the programmer's
name in the next news item (and probably this one) seems to have
confused my XSLT sentence end detection algorithm, so the RSS
feed is slightly broken again today. I have to figure out how to
tell the difference between a period that ends a sentence and a
period that follows a middle initial. Maybe I can test whether
there's at least two alphabetic characters before the period? Not
too many English sentences end with a single letter word (though
I suppose I can imagine something like "Kernighan and Ritchie
today released a new version of C."). </p>

BBEDit now makes heroic efforts to determine what character set a
document is written in using Macintosh metadata, byte order
marks, XML declarations, and HTML meta headers rather than jsut
assuming by default that all files are written with the

<p> The cron job that generates the RSS feed for this site
upchucked again this morning. Something about
"xmlNanoHTTPConnectAttempt: Connect attempt timed out." which
seems strange because all files are read from the file system. Oh
wait, maybe it's the XHTML DTD from W3C it couldn't read. (I just
figured that out as I was typing this). I should make a local
copy and point to it instead. I figure that once this system runs
without manual intervention for a couple of weeks, I'll add it to

This basically describes subset of JAXP, JAX-RPC, and XML

devices. Like a lot of web services specs, it makes a lot of
mistakes when it comes to XML. For instance, it confuses DTDs
with document type declarations, and validation with DTD
processing. It effectively defines a subset of XML that

<p> Edwin Dankert's released <a
href="http://xngr.org/">eXchaNGeR 1.0</a>, an open source XML
browser and editor framework, written in Java. eXchaNGeR provides
both tree and source views of XML documents. It supports
validation against DTDs and schemas, XPath queries, and plug-ins
for specific XML applications such as SVG, XHTML, and SOAP. I've
been very skeptical of most such efforts in the past, but this
one looks like it might actually be useful if the performance is
adequate. I'm going to have to download it and try it out.
eXchaNGeR is published under the Mozilla Public License. </p>

<p> Update: I've tried it out. It's better than most, but still
inadequate for real work. The editor only seems to work on valid
documents. (Assuming validity is a very common error in XML
software.) It can handle small documents, and handles large ones
better than most other editors, but there are noticeable delays
when loading files. eXchaNGeR is definitely not competitive speed
wise with a basic text editor such as emacs, jEdit, or BBEdit.
And there are lots of little glitches and user interface
inconsistencies. For instance, the menus change depending on what
is or is not open. Saving files failed due to various exceptions.
There are some interesting ideas here, but eXchaNGeR needs a lot
more work before it's ready for prime time. </p>

<p> My derogatory comments about cookies continue to elicit howls
of disbelief from developers who just don't see how they can
create useful web applications without cookies. A lot of people
think I'm talking about hiding the cookie in the URL, but that's
not really what I mean at all, nor is it necessary. Until I have
time to lay out the principles in more detail, let me just state
one maxim that may suggest how you need to adjust your thinking
to design session-free web applications: </p>

<blockquote> State is a property of the resource, not the client.
All necessary state is stored in the resource itself, never on
the client. </blockquote>

<p> I'm afraid I don't have time to elaborate on this right now
since I'm way past deadline on my next book. (I started to, but
it quickly became obvious this was a lot more than a quick
paragraph for this web site.)  But once that book is done, I do
plan to  publish some articles demonstrating exactly how to do
what everyone is telling me is impossible. I'll also probably be
talking about this at Software Development East in Boston in
September. None of this is original research, though. It's all
been done before, both in practice and theory. I have not
personally invented any of this. In fact, this is the way HTTP
was designed to work by the people who did invent it, as opposed
to the engineers at Netscape who glued together a bunch of hacks
like cookies, frames, and the font tag without ever really
understanding HTTP or HTML. We're finally digging out from under
the rubble left by Netscape's efforts to "improve"  HTML. Now
it's time to start repairing the damage they did to HTTP. </p>

be explicitly specified using xsi:type attributes. Saxon still
doesn't perform schema validation before transforming. Version
7.4 also implements XPath 1.0 backwards compatibility mode for

<p> FTD.com has revealed that a <a
href="http://news.com.com/2100-1017-984585.html?tag=lh">hole</a>
in their web systems potentially allowed hackers to easily access
customer information including names, addresses, credit card
numbers, and everything else that would be needed to place
fraudulent orders. They're blaming it on poor cookie design, but
that's a misdiagnosis. The real problem is that they designed a
stateful, session-based application on top of the fundamentally
stateless HTTP protocol. This enabled hackers to masquerade as
other sessions. That they did this with cookies is almost
incidental. The same problem could have occurred with URL
rewriting. </p>

<p> Had the FTD store been designed properly with a stateless,
session-free, RESTful interface that relied on HTTP
authentication--in other words one that worked the way the web
was  designed to work instead of using session hacks--this would
never have happened. A lot of web developers are so accustomed to
building sites the wrong way they don't even believe the right
way can possibly work, but it can and it does. Cookies are
<strong>never</strong> necessary. Anything useful that can be
done with cookies can be done without them including user
authentication and shopping carts. Every site that relies on
cookies for proper operation is broken. </p>

<blockquote> <p> The World Wide Web as it is currently

the documents and capabilities available are based on keyword
searches, abetted by clever use of document connectivity and
usage patterns. The sheer mass of this data is unmanageable
without powerful tool support. In order to map this terrain more
precisely, computational agents require machine-readable
descriptions of the content and capabilities of web accessible
resources. These descriptions must be in addition to the
human-readable versions of that information. </p> <p> The Web

can be used to describe the classes and relations between them

<p> I've set up a cron job to update the <a href="today.rss">RSS
Feed </a> approximately hourly, during the usual hours when I
work on this site. Another change necessitated by the use of RSS
is that this page is now invalid XHTML. I needed to use the XHTML
DTD to prevent the XSLT processor from choking on entity
references like <code>&amp;eacute;</code>, and that in turn
required using the XHTML namespace. However, the page should
still be served as plain HTML to most browsers. </p>

<hr />

<p>
I've posted version 1.0d10 of <a
href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/XOM/">XOM</a>, my new XML
Object Model for Java. This release focuses on  namespaces.
First, it fixes all the known bugs in namespace handling. It also
makes one API change. The <code>declareNamespace</code> method is
once again <code>addNamespaceDeclaration</code>. Under the hood,
however, there are much more significant changes in namespace
handling, and these are likely to break some existing
applications. XOM is published under the LGPL. </p>

<hr />

<p> <a
href="http://foa.sourceforge.net">FOA (Formatting Object
Authoring tool) 0.5</a> has been released. FOA is a Java
application "that gives users a graphical interface to author
<acronym title="XSL Formatting Objects">XSL-FO</acronym> stylesheets. With FOA you can generate pages, page
sequences and fill them with content provided into one or more
XML files. FOA will generate the XSLT stylesheet that transforms
the XML content into an <acronym title="XSL Formatting Objects">XSL-FO</acronym> document." New features in 0.5.0
include  bricks for block and inline containers, footnotes,
floats, external (foreign) objects, and leaders as well as
support for table captions, hyphenation, and background images.
</p>

<hr />

<p> IBM has  updated their <a
href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/xml4j">XML Parser for
Java</a> to version 4.1.4. This release is probably based on
Xerces-J 2.3.0 (The Web page is unclear, but the timing of this
release suggest that.) and supports the W3C XML Schema
Recommendation 1.0, SAX 1.0 and 2.0, DOM Level 1, DOM Level 2,
and some experimental features of DOM Level 3 Core and Load/Save
Working Drafts, JAXP 1.2, and XNI. </p>

<p> Happy Fifth Birthday XML! Wow. Has it only been five years?
It feels like longer, I guess because I got involved about a year
before the final release. Still you've accomplished a lot more in
five years than most acronyms do in 50. Here's to the next five
years! </p>

<p> I think I need a birthday present for you. How about <a
href="today.rss">this</a>? Cafe con Leche now has an RSS feed. A
lot of readers have asked me for this; and I've resisted, mostly
because I didn't want to make Cafe con Leche look exactly like
every other RSS site on the planet. Stories here are divided by
day, not story, and don't have titles. RSS really doesn't fit
that structure very well; and I didn't want to waste extra time
devising titles for each story just to fit RSS. </p>

<p> However, this weekend I had the brain flash that the first
sentence of each story, while it might not be a classic title,
was certainly good enough for stuffing in RSS. So I decided to
whip up a quick XSLT stylesheet that would extract the first
sentence of each story and put it into an RSS file. </p>

<p> I anticipated that finding the sentence boundaries would be
tricky, and it was, but not too tricky. What really slowed me
down was finding the story boundaries. Each story on Cafe con
Leche is separated from the next by a  horizontal rule. That is
the structure looks something like this: </p>

<pre><code>&lt;today&gt; story &lt;hr/> story &lt;hr/> story
&lt;hr/> story &lt;/today&gt;</code></pre>

<p> Each story is marked up in HTML. View source if you want more
details. About the first dozen things I tried ranging from simple
to complex, failed to produce the desired results. This is one
use-case where XSLT 2.0 would have helped a lot:
<code>&lt;&lt;</code> and <code>>></code> operators, node-set
intersections, templates creating node-sets rather than result
tree fragments; all of these  would have made the problem much
easier. I could have used some extension functions, but I knew it
had to be possible in XSLT 1.0 (It's Turing complete after all)
and after a few hours I finally came up with a recursive template
that did the trick by counting the number of <code>hr</code>
elements that were found in a node's following-sibling axis. </p>

<p> There are still some things I need XSLT 2 or extension
functions for, notably determining the base URI of the document
being transformed and getting the current date and time.
(Possibly I can hack the latter using the <code>document()</code>
function if I can find or create an HTTP server that serves the
current time in XML. Interestingly a SOAP service would not work
here, but a RESTful one would.) If I had these two functions I
could write one stylesheet that worked for both Cafe con Leche
and Cafe au Lait. Right now though I think I'm going to debug and
test this here on Cafe con Leche before adding one to Cafe au
Lait. I just noticed the title of the page doesn't seem to be
getting through. OK, I found my mistake there. A DTD or schema
would have caught that earlier. Now I notice RSS 0.91 has some
size limits I may have to work around. Hmm, it seems like RSS
0.92 eliminates them so upgrading the version number fixes that
problem. Done. </p>

<p> I still need to figure out how I'm going to automate this.
The simplest solution is probably just using a cron job to invoke
the stylesheet. If you look at this site with RSS right now,
you're actually seeing yesterday's news. </p>

Requirements for the Ink Markup Language</a>. According to the
abstract, </p>

<blockquote> The Ink Markup Language will serve as the data
format for representing ink entered with an electronic pen or
stylus in a multimodal system. The markup will allow for the
input and processing of handwriting, gestures, sketches, music
and other notational languages in web-based multimodal

<p> R.V.Guha of  IBM and  Patrick Hayes of the University of West
Florida have published a W3C note on <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/NOTE-lbase-20030123">LBase:
Semantics for Languages of the Semantic Web</a>. According to the
abstract, </p>


<blockquote> <p> This document presents a framework for
specifying the semantics for the languages of the Semantic Web.
Some of these languages (notably RDF [RDF-PRIMER]
[RDF-VOCABULARY] [RDF-SYNTAX] [RDF-CONCEPTS] [RDF-SEMANTICS], and
OWL [OWL]) are currently in various stages of development and we
expect others to be developed in the future. This framework is
intended to provide a framework for specifying the semantics of
all of these languages in a uniform and coherent way. The
strategy is to translate the various languages into a common
'base' language thereby providing them with a single coherent
model theory. </p>

<p> We describe a mechanism for providing a precise semantics for
the Semantic Web Languages (referred to as SWELs from now on. The
purpose of this is to define clearly the consequences and allowed
inferences from constructs in these languages. </p> </blockquote>

<p> Hmmm, let me see if I understand this. XML was supposed to
provide semantics to the Web, but it wasn't enough so RDF was
invented. But it turned out that RDF wasn't enough either, so OWL
was invented. Then it turned out that OWL wasn't enough so now we
have SWELs. I'm beginning to understand Clay Shirky's point that
it's <a

<p> The  W3C Quality Assurance Team has posted two useful notes
on <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/NOTE-cuap-20030128">Common
User Agent Problems</a> and <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/NOTE-chips-20030128/">Common HTTP
Implementation Problems</a>. The former should required reading
for anyone  attempting to write  a browser. In particular, the IE
team at Microsoft really needs to read this, though they're
hardly the only group out there that can benefit. </p>

<p> The second note should be read by anyone attempting to write
a web server of any kind, whether a traditional web server like
Apache, or some sort of application server like WebObjects. In
particular, the section on URIs is required reading for Apple's
web team, the WebObjects developers, and all the subscribers to
the webobjects-talk mailing list who just noticed that I called
their favorite software  a piece of animal feces back in <a
href="http://www.cafeaulait.org/2002october.html#
news2002October25"> October</a> (Actually, I was more polite than
that; but I shouldn't have been.) and who persist in bombarding
me with e-mails that only prove that they really don't understand
HTTP. Here are a few clues for the clueless: </p>

<ul> <li>All URLs should be able to be bookmarked and linked to.
</li>
<li>HTTP is stateless by design.</li>
<li>The difference
between GET and POST has nothing to do with how many characters
broken browsers can stuff into a URL. </li>
<li>Cookies are
unnecessary for user authentication, shopping carts, or anything
else. </li> </ul>

<p> Yes, more developers and more software operate the wrong way
than the right way. This includes WebObjects, though it's hardly
alone here. There are many other broken sites and broken software
that behave similarly. Good library software is implemented by
experts who really know their field. The software does the right
thing so the developers who use it don't have to be experts in
the field. WebObjects is not good software. It was obviously
designed by programmers who were not HTTP experts. They may have
known a lot of things about GUI design, databases, programmer
productivity, and the like; but they didn't know HTTP.
Consequently, they made a lot of novice mistakes that are now
propagated by almost every web designer using WebObjects.
WebObjects makes it easy to do the wrong thing. </p>

<p> If you want to argue that the Web  architecture is a bad
architecture, that HTTP should allow state, that unbookmarkable
URLs are a good idea, and so forth, feel free; but first you have
to understand what you're criticizing. Do the necessary homework
to understand what the web architecture you're arguing against is
(and of course whether you really want to be arguing against it
in the first place). Otherwise you end looking as foolish to
people who do understand the web architecture as the early 20th
century etiquette books that suggested you write a letter to
people you wanted to call on the phone to find out when would be
the appropriate time to call look to someone who actually
understands the phone system. Here are a few places you might
want to start: </p>

Primer</a></dt> <dd> According to the abstract, RDF "is
particularly intended for representing metadata about Web
resources, such as the title, author, and modification date of a
Web page, copyright and licensing information about a Web
document, or the availability schedule for some shared resource.
However, by generalizing the concept of a 'Web resource', RDF can
also be used to represent information about things that can be
identified on the Web, even when they can't be directly
<em>retrieved</em> on the Web. RDF provides a common framework
for expressing this information so it can be exchanged between
applications without loss of meaning.

This Primer is designed to provide the reader with the basic
knowledge required to effectively use RDF. It introduces the
basic concepts of RDF and describes its XML syntax. It describes
how to define RDF vocabularies using the RDF Vocabulary
Description Language, and gives an overview of some deployed RDF
applications. It also describes the content and purpose of other
RDF specification documents." </dd>

<p> <a href="http://www.elharo.com/">www.elharo.com</a> is back
up today. The static web site is running. I still have to restore
the web services on the box. This time I'm going to try to use
the real Tomcat instead of Sun's hacked version for the Cobalt
Qube to see if I can get the URLs I published in <cite><a
href="books/xmljava">Processing XML with Java</a></cite> to work
again. </p>

<hr />

<p> The Apache XML Project has published the
first public version of the <a
href="http://xml.apache.org/axis/wsif">Web Services Invocation
Framework (WSIF) 2.0</a>. WSIF  is a Java API for invoking 
remote services described by the Web Services Description
Language. WSIF developers interact with Web Services at the
abstract level through their WSDL descriptions. This is done
independently of APIs specific to a message format or network
protocol such as SOAP. According to the announcement, </p>

<blockquote> <p> With WSIF, developers work with the same
programming model regardless of how the Web service is
implemented and accessed. WSIF achieves this with a pluggable
architecture with protocol-specific "providers" to handle
invocations according to a specific protocol. </p>

<p> Apache WSIF 2.0 comes bundled with providers for SOAP (using
Apache SOAP or Axis), local java classes, EJBs, JMS services and
applications accessible via Java Connectors. WSIF also describes
the specific WSDL extensions used to make these kinds of
applications accessible as WSDL-described services. </p>

<p> WSIF allows stubless or completely dynamic invocation of a
Web service, based upon examination of the meta-data about the
service at runtime. It also allows updated implementations of a
binding to be plugged into WSIF at runtime, and it allows the
calling service to defer choosing a binding until runtime. </p>
</blockquote>


<hr />

<p> It hit me suddenly today that a lot of different
communities intensely dislike web services for similar, but
totally different reasons: </p>

<ul> <li>The HTTP community detests SOAP/XML-RPC/Web Services
because they violate the fundamental design of HTTP.</li>
<li>The
XML community detests SOAP/XML-RPC because they violate the
fundamental design of XML.</li>
<li>The security community
detests SOAP/XML-RPC/Web Services because they violate
fundamental network security principles.</li> </ul>

<p> It's interesting that the Web Services community has managed
to alienate three different communities for three different
reasons that all derive from not understanding or accepting the
basic principles of the technologies they're building on. They're
either geniuses or idiots. My money's on idiots, but time will
tell. </p>

Style Sheets, level 2 revision 1</a>, that is, CSS 2.1. Unusually
for a new spec, this goes backwards from the previous version. It
focuses on removing properties from CSS2 rather than adding them.
The impetus for removal is the failure of browser vendors to
implement them. Features removed include: </p>

<ul> <li>font-stretch</li>
<li>font-size-adjust</li>
<li>Aural
style sheets</li>
<li>text-shadow</li> </ul>

<p> In addition, CSS 2.1 adds  support for media-specific style
sheets, content positioning, table layout, internationalization
and some properties related to user interface. It also "corrects
a few errors in CSS2 (the most important being a new definition
of the height/width of absolutely positioned elements, more
influence for HTML's 'style' attribute and a new calculation of
the "clip" property)." </p>

<p> This release restores the previously removed support for
named counters and page margins. </p>

<p> James Clark has

<li>translate a RELAX NG schema in the XML

<li>translate a RELAX NG
schema in either the XML or compact syntax into a DTD</li>
<li>translate a RELAX NG schema in either the XML or compact

<p> Eric

Instead of being compiled into a XSLT transformation, Examplotron
schemas are now compiled into Relax NG schemas (with embedded
Schematron rules when needed). </p>

<p> The XML Apache
Project has released version 2.3.0 of the open source <a
href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces2-j/index.html">Xerces-J</a>
XML parser for Java. As of version 2.3.0, the Xerces Native
Interface (XNI) core and parsers packages are declared finished.
You should be able to rely on these APIs going forward. This
release also brings Xerces-J into compliance with the latest
working drafts of  DOM Level 3 Core and Load/Save, though the
relevant classes are still in the
<code>org.apache.xerces.dom3</code> package instead of
<code>org.w3c.dom</code>. It introduces many fixes to bring
Xerces-J's behaviour into line with XML Schema errata. This
release adds experimental support for XML 1.1. Finally, Xerces-J
can be configured to reject documents that implement the billion
laughs attack (though it's not clear exactly how this is
accomplished. Perhaps by just rejecting all documents that
contain a document type declaration? That seems unnecessarily
harsh to me.) </p>

<p> I've arrived in Munich. The beer is good, though not as
wonderful as I'd been told. The food, however, is fantastic,
especially the sausages. I'm in the OOP 2003 speaker's lounge
right now. They've got quite good Internet access here.
Unfortunately I've accidentally left my quotes file at home (I'm
getting quite tired of file transfer programs that silently die
when they fail to copy everything you've asked them to copy. I
especially don't see why a program should give up on files J-Z
just because it couldn't copy file I.) so unless someone here
says something memorable in English (most of the talks are in
German) the quote probably won't get updated until next week. :-(

Valentine's Day (February 14). </p>

<p> For the XML track, we're interested in practical sessions
covering all aspects of XML. This is not specifically an XML
show, so we tend to find that our audience responds better to
more practical, how-to, basic sessions as opposed to more
theoretical, high-level sessions. For instance, a simple
introduction to XQuery would go over better than a detailed
comparison of XQuery optimization techniques. One thing previous
attendees have told us is that they'd like to see more new
sessions at each show, so we're going to be looking
preferentially for talks that have not previously been given at
SD East. </p>

<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/NOTE-EMMAreqs-20030113">note
on <cite>Requirements for EMMA</cite></a>. EMMA is the
"Extensible MultiModal Annotation language." According to the
abstract, "EMMA is intended as a data format for the interface
between input processors and interaction management systems. It
will define the means for recognizers to annotate application
specific data with information such as confidence scores, time
stamps, input mode (e.g. key strokes, speech or pen), alternative
recognition hypotheses, and partial recognition results, etc.
EMMA is a target data format for the semantic interpretation
specification being developed in the Voice Browser Activity, and
which describes annotations to speech grammars for extracting
application specific data as a result of speech recognition. EMMA
supercedes earlier work on the natural language semantics markup
language in the Voice Browser Activity." </p>

XSLT debugger is also new in this release. Sablotron is dual
licensed under the the Mozilla Public License 1.1 and the GNU
General Public License (GPL). It should run on most modern
Windows and Unixes. </p>

<p> Yesterday at MacWorld in San Francisco, Steve Jobs announced
<a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a>, a new web
browser Apple has developed for Mac OS X based on Konqueror's
HTML rendering engine. It shows some original thought in UI
design including better bookmark management, snapback for Google
searches, and auto-cleanup of decompressed downloads (not so sure
I like this one but you can probably turn it off). It is
allegedly the fastest browser on Mac OS X (though Mozilla was
conspicuously absent from the comparative benchmarks and charts
Jobs displayed). Safari supports HTML, XHTML, DOM, CSS,
JavaScript, QuickTime, Flash and Shockwave. However, in my
initial tests XML does not seem to be supported with either CSS
or XSLT stylesheets. SVG is also not supported. Java is
supported. However, the initial reports are that it is extremely
buggy and will crash the browser in short order. Safari is
free-beer for Mac OS X. Other missing features include AutoFill
Forms, ad blocking, tabbed browsing, full cookie control, and
support for right-to-left languages like Hebrew. </p>

<p> Jobs also announced Keynote, a $99 payware presentation
program sort of like PowerPoint. Notable for readers of this web
site is that it saves its files in a native XML format. (It also
imports and exports PowerPoint files, as well as PDF and many
Graphics formats.) </p>

<p> The first beta of <a
href="http://porting.openoffice.org/mac/index.html">OpenOffice
1.0 for Mac OS X</a> has been posted. This open source office
suite includes a word processor, spreadsheet, presentation
program, and draw program. On Mac OS X, it uses X-Windows for
display. Future versions may use Aqua instead. OpenOffice saves
its native files as gzipped XML. It can also read and write
Microsoft Office documents. A final release is planned for the
Spring. </p>

<p> Fluxmedia and INRIA have released <a
href="http://transmorpher.inrialpes.fr">Transmorpher 1.0</a>, "a
software tool for defining and processing complex transformations
of XML documents. It can accept external transformations (e.g.,
XSLT stylesheets) and provide a simple transformation language
offering unit transformations (suppression, renaming, regular
expression substitutions and query facilities). In addition to
generating, transforming and serializing XML documents, it
features constructors like merging, dispatching, querying,
iterating, and composing transformations. These transformations
can have several input and output streams. New implementation of
these constructors can be plugged in Transmorpher. Transmorpher
can be used as a compiler, an interpreter, a Ant task, a Servlet
generator or embeded in another program." </p>

<p> IBM's alphaWorks has updated their <a
href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/xrr">XML
Registry/Repository</a>, a data management system that provides
services for XML artifacts  including DTDs, schemas, stylesheets,
and instance documents. Developers can use XRR to obtain an XML
artifact automatically, search or browse for an XML artifact,
deposit an XML artifact with or without related data, and
register an XML artifact without deposit. Users can search for
registered objects based on their metadata. "New features enable
registering, storing, and managing of XML artifacts such as DTDs,
schemas, and style sheets." This runs on AIX, Linux, Solaris, and
 Windows NT/2000 </p>

<p> Johannes Dobler's released version 1.4 of <a
href="http://www.aztecrider.com/xslt/">jd.xslt</a>, an open
source XSLT processor written in Java that supports most of the
now defunct XSLT 1.1 working draft. This release fixes tail
recursion (again), adds an Ant buildfile, upgrades from the old
IBM version of the Bean Scripting Framework to the new Apache
version, supports Pull Parsers, supports XInclude, and works
better with large (> 20MB) documents. </p>
