<A HREF="http://www.jxml.com/mdsax/index.html">MDSAX</A> (Multi-Document Simple API for XML) 
is an ongoing project to develop a set of tools for working with Java SAX parsers and
parser filters. MDSAX provides developers with considerably more control 
over the creation and stacking order
of SAX filters, and makes it simple for programs to specify different 
filter stacks for different types of
documents (as identified by their root elements.) 
Factory classes make it possible to construct and initialize
filters to take full advantage of all of their features without 
extensive custom coding. MDSAX also provides
access to a number of services, allowing filters to 
communicate amongst themselves and with the application.
</P>

<P>
MDSAX originated as a part of Coins 4, a BSD-licensed open source project that uses XML to provide much
friendlier and more flexible object serialization than current alternatives. No understanding of Coins is needed
to use MDSAX, however - just an understanding of the SAX model for event-based parsers. MDSAX will work
with any SAX-compliant parser or parser filter.

The 
XML Fragment working group has published its initial
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-XML-FRAG-REQ">Requirements document</A>.
The XML Fragment working group is chartered with defining a way
to send fragments of an XML document--regardless of whether the
fragments are predetermined entities or not--without having to
send all of the containing document up to the part in question.
This document specifies the design principles and requirements
for this activity. Comments are solicited.

Paul Butkiewicz's <A HREF="http://home.earthlink.net/%7Earabbit/xmlnet/">XMLNet</A> is a Java API for streaming XML. 
Using XMLNet, information such as realtime sports scores
can be
transferred over the Internet in real time as a series of
XML documents immediately and with high frequency on a schedule determined
by a server, as opposed to relying upon requests from clients. These
documents are delivered, one after another, on continuously open sockets to
connected clients and delivered to objects in that client as Document Object
Model (DOM) documents. Client objects can subscribe to any of these documents 
by implementing an interface and
specifying which documents it would like to receive.

sunsite to metalab, particularly the dueling rewrites problem.
(The Web server helpfully rewrites each sunsite URL

XML-APP is a new, informal, unmoderated mailing list created to
support those who are interested in developing XML applications.
 This mailing list differs from XML-DEV in that it is intended
to promote deployment of XML standards in real world
applications.
Only topics related to the application of XML technology are
appropriate for this mailing list. XML-APP represents the
"dwarvish" aspect of the  XML community, down in the dirt and
slime, working feverishly to make things work, and hounded by
over-hype and deadlines.  
You can subscribe by sending a blank message to

about the <A

Query Language</A> (XQL).  XQL, allegedly supported in IE 5.0 beta 2 
(though I haven't yet tested this myself) allows 
developers to 
execute SQL like queries on XML documents.
On the one hand I can see how this might be useful.
On the other hand I'm worried developers will
pour huge amounts of data into documents sent to the client
rather than storing them in databases on the server
and only sending the clients what they want.

Last night, my NT box finally finished downloading IE 5.0 sometime in the 
early A.M. hours, so I'll be checking it out today, and post more comments here later.
</P>

<P>
<strong>Update:</strong> I've finished checking and IE 5.0 most definitely does support
direct display of XML documents plus CSS style sheets. 
 Here's a very simple example of an <a href="examples/books1.xml">XML 
document</a>
formatted with a <a href="examples/books.css">CSS style sheet</a>.
View source to see the actual data. If you look at it in

Hans C. Arents,

the recently released IE 5.0 beta 2:
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>I saw a demo today by Sebastien Mizon of Microsoft France, given at the XML
Forum conference in Paris (<a href="http://www.technoforum.fr/Pages/xml/xml.htm">http://www.technoforum.fr/Pages/xml/xml.htm</a>), of
the XML capabilities of IE 5.0 beta 2. IE 5.0 by default shows a well-formed
XML document as a (collapsible) tree of tags with content. When you attach a
stylesheet to this XML file (a CSS 1.0 stylesheet, or an XSL stylesheet),
the XML file is shown in all its glory as if it were an HTML file (although
it is not converted to HTML, only rendered as such). As far as I could tell,
the XSL it supports is something in between the original proposal and the
present working draft, and they are clearly putting more effort in providing
support for CSS stylesheets. We also got demonstrations of the different
possibilities of the new msxml.dll XML parser (which can be used as a COM
object not only on the IE 5 client side, but also on the IIS server side,
e.g. in ASP pages), validation and error reporting for XML files in IE 5.0,
XML islands in HTML,... We also saw Word 2000 in action, confirming the
rumour that Word will *not* save in XML (and they don't plan to add this any
time soon), but will save in HTML+XML tags for all the stuff which can't be
captured in HTML. The guy from Microsoft assured me that their HTML+XML
format will be identical in content and functionalities to the content and
functionalities of their proprietary .doc format. The HTML+XML which comes
out of Word 2000 isn't any real XML (yet), and I don't think they already
have an XML DTD defined for this format: when asked to load a Word 2000
HTML+XML document in XML Notepad, XML Notepad already stopped at line 8 due
to a syntax error.

I'm still trying to download IE 5 from Microsoft. However, I have been able
to determine that this release provides optional support for the Vector
Markup Language, VML. It also adds support for Vietnamese, Thai,
Hebrew, and Arabic for the first time. Input methods for 
Chinese, Japanese, Korean, are also new. 
Most European languages are fully supported as well
including Russian and Greek. </p><p>

First reports are that this beta does support direct display
of XML files as trees, and can even apply the transform parts of XML.
I'd be interested in hearing

   name of implementing recent World Intellectual Property Organization
   (WIPO) copyright treaties. Unfortunately, some of the proposed changes
   could upset the uniquely American balance between the users and
   creators of copyrighted works. The Senate bill lacks adequate
   protections for fair use, encryption research, and personal privacy.
   It could also limit the availability of future consumer electronics
   and computer products. On the other hand, the House version contains
   many extraneous provisions that have little or nothing to do with
   implementing the important WIPO treaties. These provisions in the
   House bill would overturn three consumer-oriented Supreme Court
   decisions. The Justice department has concluded that one of these
   provisions, Title V, which creates sweeping new anti-fair-use rights
   in databases and other collections of information, may well be
   unconstitutional. (This Title V was previously a separate bill, the
   "Collections of Information Antipiracy Act.") Now is the time to speak
   up because these meetings will determine the final form of this
   legislation as it goes to the President's desk to be signed into law.
<P>
   If you care about the future of the Internet, you should let your
   Senators and Representatives know, as soon as possible, how important
   it is to preserve the essential provisions of the House DMCA, which
   protects fair use, personal privacy, the availability of consumer
   products and encryption research - while rejecting its harmful
   extraneous provisions.

For some work I'm doing with Unicode programs, I need a large quantity of
public domain Greek text encoded in Unicode or UTF-8, perhaps something like
Homer's Odyssey or Plato's Republic. I could also convert 
text encoded in ISO 8859-7, Windows 1253, or MacGreek.  However, all I've found so
far is a variety of Roman transliterations and English and German
translations.
If you happen to know of such a thing available on the Internet,
could you please <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111&#58;elharo%40metalab%2Eunc%2Eedu">drop me a line</A>?
Cyrillic text (War and Peace? The Brothers Karamazov?) would also be useful,

I'm back from SD98 East in D.C. so this page should be updated more reliably
this week. There was a surprising amount of interest in XML expressed by attendees although it was by no means a focus of the show, and most of the
XML heavyweights were up in Canada at the XML Developers Conference in Quebec.  Extrapolating from the set of 
attendees at SD98 East to
the complete set of U.S. programmers, I'd say that most programmers don't know a lot about XML yet but they definitely want to know more.  Although I was there to talk about Java Network Programming, I got a lot more

Several correspondents noted that the galaxy on the cover of

is the "Sombrero Galaxy". The most detailed response comes from
Robert J. Brunner of Caltech's Astronomy Department:
<P>


<BLOCKQUOTE>As a professional Astronomer, I thought I would give you a little
information on your book cover. The object appears to be the Sombrero
Galaxy (Officially known as Messier 104). It has not, nor could it be
(at least to my knowledge), been imaged by the Hubble space telescope
(it is relatively nearby and hence too large to fit within their
aperture). It is a late Sa or early Sb type galaxy that is inclined to
us by around 6 degrees -- thus your observations as to an edge on spiral
is quite astute.
<P>
This page contains links to images of M104, some of which should look
very familiar.

MacInTouch has noted an <a href="http://www.macintouch.com/msie-mystery.html"> Internet Explorer 4.0 mystery</a> involving unrequested connections

Mac IE 4.01 ships with an Active Channel named "Internet Explorer for Macintosh Channel" written in the XML-based  Channel Definition Format (CDF).
<P>
CDF, discussed in Chapter 10 of my upcoming book <CITE><A HREF="books/xml/">XML: Extensible Markup Language</A></CITE>,
  allows
web sites to automatically notify readers of changes to critical information.
Of course what's really going on is that the client machine periodically connects back to the server machine to look for updates,

by removing the channel file  DefaultChannels.html from the Explorer 
inside the  Preferences folder inside the System Folder.

I stopped by PC Expo in New York yesterday and overall it was quite 
boring. There was almost no XML  anywhere. I did hear from one
gentlemant the Adobe booth that FrameMaker with XML support is now
in private beta, and may be out by the end of the year.
<P>
I did note that for the first time in several years
most companies on the main show floor managed to resist the urge 
to label every program, printer, mouse, scanner, hard drive
and other gizmo as "Internet ready" or "Web compatible". 
There was a separate
WebX hall that was almost empty of attendees.  Finally, the
Internet appears to be fading into the background of the computing 
infrastructure rather than being the "hot new thing."

Lesley West and Peter Murray-Rust have launched the

According to them:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Terminology (glossaries, dictionaries, etc.) are an essential part of
providing semantic information ("what does FOO mean?"). The VHG is aimed at
providing this in a distributed WWW context as has been developed so that
non-experts in terminology can construct their own glossaries. Because
these use XML syntax they can interoperate with any XML document and can
therefore be used as a simple but powerful way of adding semantics. The VHG
approach is deliberately simple so that glossaries can be developed and
maintained without special tools. 
<P>
The VHG is built from existing or emerging standards, at present:<P>
<ul>
	<li> XML1.0 for syntax
<li> XLink (XML-LINK) for providing structure (e.g to support multilinguality)
	<li> ISO FDIS 12620 for terminological data categories
</ul>
The VHG is a philosophy as well as a technology and encourages
organisations to develop their terminology for use in a global distributed
context. We are already partnering with providers of high-quality content
such as learned societies and governmental organisations. </BLOCKQUOTE>

Since the server's up and running, that certainly looks like it could be the

why you would want to pay $795 to beta test their product?
