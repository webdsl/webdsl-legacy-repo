Norman Walsh has posted 
version 1.2 of his <a href="http://nwalsh.com/docbook/xsl">XSL style sheets for DocBook</a>.
This version adds support for
XT-based chunking and various other improvements.
</p>

<p>
Walsh has also released version 0.03 of his 
<a href="http://www.nwalsh.com/xsl/xslint/index.html">XSL Lint</a> written in Perl.
XSL Lint is a semantic lint checker for XSL.
This release adds variables and recognizes the XSLT URI.

IBM's <a href="http://www-4.ibm.com/software/data/db2/extenders/xmlext/index.html">DB2 XML Extender</a> provides new data types that let you
store XML documents in DB2 databases and new functions 
to work  with these structured documents. Entire
XML documents can be stored in DB2 databases as character data
or stored as external files managed by DB2. Retrieval
functions allow you to retrieve either the entire XML document
or individual elements or attributes. </p>

Paul Miller has released version 0.3 of 
 <a href="http://www.fxtech.com/xmlio/index.html">XMLIO, an XML 
 input/output library for C++ applications</a>.
 XMLIO is a
 simple, nestable, streaming, XML parser for C++ application
data.
Unicode is not yet supported, however, so much work remains to be done.
Version 0.3 adds chained element handlers and
support for parsing lists. The underlying parser is James Clark's expat. 
An ANSI C++ compiler with namespaces, exceptions, and the standard
library is required. 
XMLIO is free under the MIT X11 license.

Sun's posted a <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/tsc/articles/persistence/index.html">proposal 
for archiving/serializing Swing and JavaBeans based GUIs as XML</a>. 
This may help fix the problem of inconsistent binary serialization formats between JDK versions
that's especially troublesome for Swing applications.
The proposal includes a sample Bean Builder tool for 
building GUI code from the proposed XML grammar. JDK 1.3 is required.

The W3C has released the recommendation (i.e. finished standard) for
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401">HTML 4.0.1</a>,
a bug fix release to HTML 4.0. 
The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/appendix/changes.html#19991224">changes</a>
are mostly fairly minor, but do
include some fixes to make HTML more XML/XHTML compatible such as allowing attribute 
values to contain colons and underscores. (I suspect most browsers already allowed that.)
</p>

<p>The W3C also emitted a host of new working drafts right before 
Christmas. These include:

The W3C has published two revised and two new working drafts.
The first new working draft is for XBase, a means of specifying 
a base URL for the current document, much like the <code>BASE</code> element in HTML
using an <code>xml:base</code> attribute.
 The second new working draft is for
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WD-xhtml-basic-19991220/">XHTML Basic</a>,
a subset of XHTML 1.1 that contains basic XHTML features like text structure,
images, basic forms, and basic tables. XHTML Basic is 
intended for Web clients running on things that aren't
full-blown computers like 
cell phones, Palm Pilots, pagers, and set-top boxes. 
The XHTML Basic DTD is built using XHTML modules. 

</p>

<p>
The two revised working drafts are for 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WD-xlink-19991220/">XLink</a>,
 and 
the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-infoset">XML Info Set</a>.

IBM's alphaWorks has released a new version of 
the <a href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/LotusXSL">LotusXSL</a> XSLT application written in Java.
This release is essentially a wrapper around the 
Apache XML Project's Xalan XSLT processor
(which itself is based on an earlier release of LotusXSL).
This release supports the October XSLT recommendation.

<p>
AT&amp;T has released 
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/xmill">XMill 0.7</a>, a 
special purpose compression tool for XML
data.  It's been established that XML-based file formats 
are generally smaller than the corresponding binary formats,
and that after compression they range from a little smaller to a little bigger than the compressed binary.
However, XMill claims compression up to twice that of gzip by taking 
advantage of knowledge that a file is in XML.
XMill is written in C++, and is more or less free.

"Ruby" are short runs of text alongside the base text, used in
East Asian documents to indicate pronunciation or to provide a short
annotation. This specification defines markup for ruby. The
specification is written so that this markup for ruby can be included as
a module of XHTML 1.1.

The W3C has published an <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/PR-xhtml1-19991210">XHTML Proposed 
Recommendation</a>.
XHTML is a reformulation of HTML as strict XML. For example all tags are in lower case,

This means the specification is assumed to be stable. There will be a
one-month period for programmers 
to write implementations of the specification. Assuming no major bugs turn up during 
implementation, the specification will move into
          the Proposed Recommendation phase around January 19, 2000.

<li>The <a href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/visualxml">Visual XML Transformation Tool</a>
now allows you to save and resume sessions as well as fixing assorted bugs.
This tool takes as input DTDs describing the source XML documents. The
  user then visually constructs the desired structure of the new XML document, and the tool
  then generates an XSLT style sheet for transforming the
  source documents to the target document. 
<p>

<li><a href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/xmlviewer">XML Viewer</a> and 
<a href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/xplorer">Xplorer</a> now use version 1.60

As far as I know this is the first public mention of some of these proposals including 
XHTML Basic (for thin clients), XML Profiles, and
XHTML 2.0 (replacing HTML images and links with 
XLinks). More details are in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-roadmap/">note</a>

The XML Linking working group of the W3C has
posted a note about
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/NOTE-xinclude-19991123.html">XML Inclusion</a> 
  which proposes a way of merging different 
XML Infosets into a single composite Infoset. 
Some of this has been done in different ways in previous working drafts of XLink,
particularly <code>show="parsed"</code>.
All of this is controversial. Personally, I think this is important and a good idea
though I haven't explored the detailed proposal yet.

Sun's posted public draft 1 of 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/xml/download.html">The Java API for XML Parsing Specification v1.0</a>.
(Does anyone else find the word "The" a little presumptuous in the title?
Like we should all suddenly give up SAX and all the other APIs for parsing XML with Java
that we've been using successfully for over a year just because Sun has decided to go its
own way?)
This API describes a class library (more or less implemented by 
Sun's Project X) that  provides basic
functionality for reading, manipulating, and generating XML documents
from Java programs.

The W3C has revised several working drafts including
</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core">XML-Signature Core Syntax and Processing</a>
specifies syntax and processing rules for encoding digital
signatures of XML documents in XML documents. This release
focuses on editorial changes and schemas describing XML
signatures. It doesn't make any significant changes to the
actual syntax or capabilities of XML signatures. <p> <li><a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-c14n">Canonical XML Version
1.0</a> defines a procedure for determining whether two XML
documents are effectively "the same" by reducing them to a
canonical form.<p>

<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/smil-boston">Synchronized
Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL) Boston Specification</a>. This is still a very early,
very incomplete working
draft that has changed quite a bit since the last release and will undoubtedly change a lot more in the future.
<p>

<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/smil-boston-dom">Synchronized
Multimedia Integration Language Document Object Model</a>. This is also a very early working draft
that was previously part of the SMIL Boston working draft. <p>

I've updated the online versions of Chapters 
<a href="books/bible/updates/14.html">14, XSL Transformations</a>,
 and <a href="books/bible/updates/17.html">17, XPointers</a>, of the XML Bible
to match the November 16, 1999 W3C Recommendations of XSLT and XPath.
The main change in Chapter 14 is that a <code>DOCTYPE</code>
declaration is no longer output by default for HTML files.
Otherwise the changes were extremely minor.

IBM's alphaWorks has released version 1.0.5 of the 
<a href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/xmitoolkit">XMI Toolkit</a>.
XMI is an XML application for encoding UML models.
This release adds software for converting  between
Java, Rational Rose, and UML models. It also adds an API to read and write XMI 1.0 files.
It requires Windows 95, 98, or NT.

<p>
IBM's alphaWorks has released an 
<a href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/xsleditor">XSL Editor</a>
written in Java.
This editor integrates the previously released 
XSL Trace and Visual Transform tools. 
Authors can set and remove "break points" on the style sheet and
source document. The XSL Editor user interface features a
 collapsible tree view and "Dynamic 'edit pads'". 
 Most interestingly, XPath expressions can be automatically generated
 by selecting the relevant nodes from the source document.

<p>
The W3C has elevated both <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt">XSL Transformations</a> 
and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath">XPath</a> to
official recommendations. XPath does not list any changes since the October 8 Proposed Recommendation, though I haven't run a diff yet.
XSLT has two changes:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>A <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt#result-element-stylesheet">literal result element that is used as the root element
	of a stylesheet</a> must have an <code>xsl:version</code> attribute.
	This should help to avoid some common and confusing problems where <code>xsl:stylesheet</code> elements 
	with the wrong namespace are unintentionally interpreted as literal result elements.<p>

	<li>The <code>data-type</code> attribute of 
	<code><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt#sorting">xsl:sort</a></code> can use a 
	prefixed name to specify a data type not defined by XSLT. According to a note,
	"The XSL Working Group plans that future versions of XSLT will leverage XML Schemas to define further values for 
	this attribute."<p>

I'm still catching up on news that piled up in my in box while I was away at SD99 East.
If you don't normally read Cafe con Leche on the weekends be sure to scroll down for 
a lot of important developments that took place over the last week, but didn't get posted 
here till this past weekend.

<p>
Geir Ove Gronmo has posted the first 0.10 (and shortly thereafter the second 0.20)
release 
of <a href="http://www.infotek.no/%7Egrove/software/gps/index.html">GPS - Groves and Property
Sets for Python</a>. 
This is a Python implementation of the groves and property set concepts
defined in the HyTime and DSSSL standards. 
Python 1.5.2 or newer, an SGML/XML parser with a SAX driver, SAX for Python, and

The first beta of the open source application server 
<a href="http://www.enhydra.org/Enhydra_2.3.html">Enhydra 2.3</a>
is now available. Version 2.3 adds a lot more support for XML including 
XML Compilation using the IBM alphaWorks XML4J
parser. This  must be downloaded separately due to licensing restrictions though this should
be cleaned up in a future release now that XML4J is managed by the Apache Project.
Version 2.3 also adds
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) support and Dynamic Connection Methods
</p>

Let's see if I can catch up on some of the news that backed up while 
I was away at SD99 East last week. I actually had Internet access at the show but I rarely
had any time to use it before the show closed for the night.
I really wish hotels would use the 
 space wasted on the 
price gouging minibar on a 
 PC with a real Internet connection instead,
or at least an Ethernet port for a laptop. For $189 a night,
is a T-1 connection really too much to ask?
Or even a phone line that doesn't charge you several times the 
market rate for calling your ISP? This trip I stayed at the 
<a href="http://washington.hyatt.com/wasgh/index.html">Grand Hyatt</a>
on the conference's tab, but I can't see going back there if I have to pay for it myself.
D.C. has a lot of equally nice hotels for a lot less money. Last May, I stayed in a nicer room
at the
<a href="http://www.doubletree.com/DoubleT/Hotel21/27/27Main.htm">DoubleTree Suites in 
Foggy Bottom</a> for about half of what the Grand Hyatt was asking.

<p>
The biggest news of the week was the founding of the <a href="http://xml.apache.org/">Apache 
XML Project</a>. This consists of four key pieces of the XML equation:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Xerces - XML parsers in <a href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces-j/index.html">Java</a>, <a href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/index.html">C++</a>, 
and <a href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces-p/index.html">Perl</a> which will be based on the 
IBM alphaWorks XML for Java and XML for C++ parsers as well as Sun's Project X, and 
OpenXML from Exoffice and Assaf Arkin<p>
 
<li><a href="http://xml.apache.org/xalan/index.html">Xalan</a> -
XSLT stylesheet processors, in Java and C++ which will be based
on IBM alphaWorks' LotusXSL processor and , and XSL:P from Exoffice and Keith Visco. <p>

<li><a href="http://xml.apache.org/cocoon/index.html">Cocoon</a> - XML-based web publishing, written
in Java <p>
<li><a href="http://xml.apache.org/fop/index.html">FOP</a>, an XSL formatting objects to PDF converter written in Java,
developed by James Tauber <p>
</ul>

<p>These should all be true open source software without the annoying 
restrictions that limited the IBM products. This is a major step forward for XML.
Thanks are due to IBM, Sun, ExOffice, DataChannel, James Tauber, and all the others who contributed their time and code
to the community for this project.

The W3C has released several new and revised working drafts including:
</p>


<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/smil-animation">SMIL Animation</a> is the first public draft of
an animation framework and set of base XML animation elements
          suitable for integration with XML documents more or less based on the SMIL 1.0 timing
          model. <p> 
	<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-c14n">Canonical XML</a> describes
a way to reduce an XMl document to its fundamental form--for instance by eliminating insignificant white space--such that two XML documents 
whose Canonical-XML form is identical can be considered the same for the purposes of many
          applications. <p>
          
	<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-USERAGENT">User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0</a>
	provides guidelines to user agent (browser, player, plug-in, etc.) developers for making their 
	products
          accessible to people with disabilities. Last call is December 1, 1999.<p> 
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-USERAGENT-TECHS">Techniques for User Agent Accessibility 
Guidelines 1.0</a> discusses techniques vendors can use to implement the tasks described in "User
          Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0". <p>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-1">XML Schema Part 1: Structures</a> 
proposes facilities for describing the
          structure and constraining the contents of XML 1.0 documents. The schema language,
          itself an XML application, defines a superset of the capabilities found in
          XML 1.0 document type definitions (DTDs). For instance it reintroduces the functionality
          of the SGML <code>&amp;</code> operator that isn't allowed in XML DTDs.<p>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2">XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes</a> defines the 
data types used in XML documents. These include equivalents for all the major Java and SQL data types. <p>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/P3P">The Platform for Privacy Preferences 1.0 Specification</a>
describes how Web sites can express their
          privacy practices in a standard RDF format that can be retrieved automatically and
          interpreted by browsers and other user agents. Last call is April 30, 2000.<p> 
</ul>

<hr />
<p>
IBM's alphaWorks has released the first version of 
<a href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/xit">X-It</a>, 
a wizard based batch processing application for XML
 files that performs tasks like sorting,
 validating against a new DTD, finding and replacing text,
 deleting nodes, and so forth.

I have returned from SD99 East. XML was extremely hot at this conference.
For the first time, people were stopping me in the halls to talk further about my presentations.
There's certainly a lot of excitement about XML, though a lot of people are still a little
confused about what it is exactly or what they can do with it.
I've posted the notes for all my <a href="slides/sd99east/">XML presentations at the conference</a> including:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="slides/sd99east/introxml">Introduction to
XML</a>, a full day tutorial covering XML, DTDs,
XSL Transformations, and XLinks.<p>
	<li><a href="slides/sd99east/basics">XML Basics</a>, a 90 minute seminar introducing XML's syntax and uses<p>
	<li><a href="slides/sd99east/introxml">XML DTDs</a>, a 90 minute seminar introducing 
	Document Type Definitions, validity, and well formedness<p>
	<li><a href="slides/sd99east/xsl/">XSL Transformations</a>, a 90 minute seminar introducing 
	XSLT and its uses.<p>
</ul>

<p>
All slides for these talks were originally written in XML. An XSLT stylesheet was used to produce
the onscreen notes and printed handouts. 
</p>

<p>
Many other people talked about XML and related technologies
at this conference including Simon St. Laurent, James Tauber, 
Simon Phipps
(InfoWorld has a <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/displayStory.pl?991111.ecsdeast.htm">story</a>
 about his keynote), Dave Linthicum, John Ousterhout, Christian Gross, and Johnathan Eisenzopf. 
 The XML sessions were generally the most packed at the conference. Software developers are
 really beginning to catch the XML fever.

James Clark has posted a new 
release (19991105) of <a href="http://www.jclark.com/xml/xt.html">XT</a>,
his XSLT processor written in Java.
This release adds three new extension functions:
</p>

<ul>
<li><code>xt:node-set</code> for converting a result tree fragment to a node-set</li>
<li><code>xt:intersection</code> for computing the intersection of two node-sets</li>
<li><code>xt:difference</code> for computing the difference of two node-sets</li>

The W3C director, Tim Berners-Lee, 
has sent the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1">XHTML proposed recommendation</a> back to 
the HTML working group for further discussion.
Apparently he was concerned that consensus had not been achieved on some crucial issues like
the proper MIME type and whether XHTML should use one namespace or three. 
As far as I know, this is the first time he's exercised his veto power
over a proposed recommendation. In this case, it's not too big a deal
since XHTML files are for the most part completely intelligible to existing browsers as either
HTML or XML, standardization status notwithstanding.

 Leonard Muellner
have released <cite><a href="http://docbook.org/tdg/html/docbook.html">DocBook, 
The Definitive Guide</a></cite> (version 1.0.2).  According to the preface:</p>

<blockquote>DocBook provides a system for writing structured documents using SGML or XML. It is particularly
well-suited to books and papers about computer hardware and software, though it is by no means
limited to them. DocBook is an SGML document type definition (DTD). An XML version is available
now, and an official XML release is in the works. Because it is a large and robust DTD, and because its
main structures correspond to the general notion of what constitutes a book, DocBook has been
adopted by a large and growing community of authors. DocBook is supported "out of the box" by a
number of commercial tools, and support for it is rapidly growing in a number of free software
environments. In short, DocBook is an easy-to-understand and widely used DTD. Dozens of
organizations use DocBook for millions of pages of documentation, in various print and online
formats, worldwide.
</blockquote>
<p>The complete book is available <a href="http://docbook.org/tdg/html/docbook.html">online</a>.

The W3C has released new drafts of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt">XSL Transformations</a> 
and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath">XPath</a>.
Furthermore, both have been upgraded to proposed recommendation status.
James Clark has updated his <a href="http://www.jclark.com/xml/xt.html">xt</a> 
XSLT processor to support the new drafts. 
I'll  post
updated versions of my XSLT and XPath chapters from <cite>The XML Bible</cite> 
sometime in the near future. In the meantime, here's a quick summary of the changes:
</p>

<p>The XPath specification hasn't changed a great deal.
XPath results can now be defined in terms of the 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-infoset">XML Information Set</a>.
This makes the whole document somewhat clearer, and trickier points somewhat easier to 
grasp. Furthermore, there are three changes to the syntax:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>The <code>normalize()</code> function is now called <code>normalize-space()</code>.<p>

<li>The boolean <code>or</code> operator  
and the boolean <code>and</code> operator 
now shortcut evaluation where possible.
That is, the <code>or</code> operator does not evaluate the right operand if the
left operand is true, and the <code>and</code> operator does not evaluate the
right operand if the left operand is false.<p>

<li>The <code>substring(<i>string</i>, <i>offset</i>, 
<i>length</i>)</code> function now rounds the <code><i>offset</i></code> and <i><code>length</code></i> arguments
as may be necessary if they're floating point numbers.<p>
</ul>

<p>The XSLT specification hasn't changed a great deal either.
The two most obvious changes are the new namespace 
(<code>http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform</code> 
instead of <code>http://www.w3.org/XSL/Transform/1.0</code> with
a <code>version</code> attribute 
of <code>xsl:stylesheet</code> specifying the version.)
and that <code>child::</code> and <code>attribute::</code> axis specifiers can now be used in expressions rather than simply
the abbreviated syntax. For example, it's now possible to say:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;xsl:template match=&quot;child::chapter/child::section/attribute::title&quot;&gt;
  &lt;fo:block&gt;
    &lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;
  &lt;/fo:block&gt;
&lt;/xsl:template&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
This doesn't allow you to match anything that couldn't be matched before
(for instance, a match pattern still can't match elements based on their siblings; that is, it can't use the <code>ancestor</code> axis) but it may
make it slightly easier to teach and learn the pattern syntax. 
Furthermore, there are a number of other changes to the syntax:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt#section-Creating-Elements-and-Attributes">Namespace aliasing</a> has been added. This makes it much easier to write XSL stylesheets 
that use other XSL stylesheets as either input or output documents.<p>

<li>The <code><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt#stylesheet-element">xsl:stylesheet</a></code> element has a new  <code>exclude-result-prefixes</code> attribute
that can help eliminate unnecessary namespace declarations in the result tree.
This attribute can can also be applied to individual <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt#literal-result-element">literal result elements</a>.
<p>
	<li>The <code><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt#function-system-property">system-property()</a></code> function 
	no longer considers property names without a namespace URI to necessarily refer to an operating system environment variable.<p>

	<li>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt#section-HTML-Output-Method"><code>html</code> output method</a> doesn't escape <code>&lt;</code> characters inside attribute values. Furthermore, it will only include a <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;</code> in the  output HTML document
if either the <code>doctype-public</code> or the <code>doctype-system</code> attribute 
was explicitly specified.<p>

	<li>The <code>match</code> and <code>use</code> attributes of an <code><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt#key">xsl:key</a></code> element
are no longer allowed to contain variable references.. On the other hand,
the expression in the value of the <code>use</code> attribute of an <code><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt#key">xsl:key</a></code> element
can now return types other than node-set.<p>

	<li>The <code>extension-element-available()</code> and <code>extension-function-available()</code> functions have been replaced by the
 <code><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt#function-function-available">element-available()</a></code> and <code><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt#function-function-available">function-available()</a></code> functions. These can now test for standard XSL elements and functions 
like <code>xsl:key</code> and <code>document()</code> as well as extension functions.
This is important because all current XSLT implementations omit some standard
elements or functions.
 Similarly, the <code><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt#fallback">xsl:fallback</a></code> element
 can now back up standard elements as well as extension elements.<p>

	<li>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt#function-document"><code>document(<i>object</i>, <i>node-set</i>?)</code></a> 
 function consider the second argument when the first argument is a node-set. (Previously the first argument was used for both arguments if it was a node set.)<p>

	<li>The <code>xsl:locale</code> element has been changed to <code><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt#format-number">xsl:decimal-format</a></code>, since
	it didn't really affect anything other than number formatting in the first place. Furthermore, several defaults on 
<code>xsl:decimal-format</code> (nee <code>xsl:locale</code>) have changed. 
The <code>NaN</code> attribute now defaults to the string "NaN" 
instead of the
Unicode replacement character &#xFFFD;; and 
the <code>infinity</code> attribute defaults to the string "Infinity"
instead of the Unicode infinity character &#x221E;. 
(If your browser can't render the above two characters, that largely explains why this had to be changed.)           
<p>

	<li>When the <code>data-type</code> attribute of the <code><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt#element-sort">xsl:sort</a></code> element has the value <code>number</code>, the <code>lang</code> attribute is ignored in sorting.<p>

	<li>The <code>xml-declaration</code> attribute of the <code><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt#output">xsl:output</a></code> element has been replaced by an <code>omit-xml-declaration</code> element. By default, the
XML declaration is now included in the output document.
<p>

	<li>The <code>other</code> value  for the <code>letter-value</code> attribute of <code><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt#convert">xsl:number</a></code> is now called
<code>traditional</code> but still has the same semantics.<p>

	<li>The <code><code>xsl:message</code></code> element now has a <code>terminate</code> attribute. If the value of this attribute is <code>yes</code>, then the XSLT processor shoudl shut down after processing the message.<p>
</ul>

<p>Aside from the single change in the namespace URI, most of these changes won't affect many existing stylesheets.
Those sheets that are affected should be easily fixed.

My previous record was #102 for <cite>Java I/O</cite>. This is probably because <cite>The XML Bible</cite>

it from amazon
 today</a> so we can push the book into the <strong>top 50</strong>.
Plus, Amazon's selling it for <strong>40% off</strong> today, and they normally don't maintain that
high a discount on my books for more than a week, so it pays to act quickly.

a Java program that creates test cases for DTDs by 
by generating
instances of valid XML from an input DTD. 
</p></li>

<li><p>Second is <a href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/visualdtd">Visual DTD</a>, a builder tool for creating,
 viewing, and editing DTDs. 
</p></li>

<li><p>Next is the <a href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/visualxml">Visual XML Transformation Tool</a>
for composing new XML
 documents based on existing XML documents. 
</p></li>

<li><p>Finally, <a href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/xsltrace">XSL Trace</a> helps debug XSL stylesheets by
 stepping through XSL
 scripts and showing the transformation
 rules as they are created and the output as it is generated.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr /></hr>
<p>
I've updated the <a href="http://metalab.unc.edu/javafaq/bush/">Bush Files</a>.
Most importantly, both the XML and tab delimited versions now properly distinguish
first from last name as well as city from state so it's possible to easily sort and search on these fields.
This version also fixes a number of niggling problems in the structure of the data
where the value of one field (e.g. amount contributed) shifted into a different field
(e.g. date).

The W3C has posted a new working drafts  on
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/i18n-format">International Layout</a> that 
describes a mechanism for
using  CSS with East Asian and bidirectional text formatting needed for traditional
Chinese, Hebrew, Arabic and similar languages.</p>

<p>
The W3C has also split up the previous 
XHTML modularization draft into five new drafts:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11">XHTML 1.1 - Module-based XHTML</a>
defines an XHTML 1.1 document that differs from XHTML 1.0 documents in<p>
<ol>
<li>Being build on modular DTDs instead of the monolithic DTD of XHTML 1.0
<li>Completely eliminating all previously deprecated elements. It includes 
applets but does not include frames.
</ol>
<p>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-modularization">Modularization of XHTML</a>
specifies an abstract modularization of XHTML 1.0. 
 
          <p>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-building">Building XHTML Modules</a> describes 
a concrete implementation of the above abstract modularization
 as a collection of component XML DTDs. (Other concrete implementations
 might also be possible, for instance with schemas).<p>
 
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-prof-req">XHTML Document Profile Requirements</a>
discusses what is required to define different
 document profiles for user agents running on different classes of displays such as
desktops, television, handhelds, cellphones and voice user
agents. <p>

<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-forms-req">XHTML Extended Forms Requirements</a>
sets out the goals for development of a new set of
form elements for XHTML that will not be backwards compatible with existing
browsers. <p>
</ul>

<p>
Overall, the modularization of XHTML allows XML developers 
to cleanly pick out the subset of HTML they need for their applications.
For example, you cam use HTML tables without automatically pulling HTML frames,
lists, or applets as well.  This is discussed in Chapter 20
of <cite><a href="books/bible/">The XML Bible</a></cite>, 
<cite>Reading Document Type Definitions</cite>.
I'll posted an updated version of that chapter that covers the new working 
drafts here on Cafe con Leche in a couple of weeks. 
(That is one of the longest chapters in the book so it may take me
a little while.)

  Friday Governor George W. Bush of Texas
posted complete records of his campaign contributions on his web site.
However, he deliberately
posted them in PDF format so they couldn't be imported into
a database or a spreadsheet, and consequently reporters and voters couldn't
find out just how much of his money was coming from whom. Or at least that's what he thought. :-)
</p>

<p>
I am pleased to announce, that
after a few hours of intense hacking <a href="http://metalab.unc.edu/javafaq/bush/">I have succeeded in extracting the 
crucial information from the PDF files and have posted
them online in tab delimited format and <strong>XML</strong> 
formats for anybody who wants them.</a>
Accountants, start your spread sheets!
</p>

<p>
I've written a <a href="http://metalab.unc.edu/javafaq/bush/donations.dtd">very simple DTD</a> 
for the XML version.  Based on this DTD the results do appear to be well-formed and valid
(though I've been burned by misbehaving validators before). The first two validators 
I tried gave up on trying to parse such a large (more than eight megabytes) document.
Interestingly, the initial conversion to XML did turn up some bugs in
my PDF-to-text converter program, but the validation of the XML did not 
find any additional problems. I can see where a schema language would be very
useful for this sort of reverse engineering work though. I'm going to try to add 
a simple XSL stylesheet to these in the near future, but they're so large that they
really challenge anyone trying to browse them directly.

I've posted the <a href="slides/xmlsig0899/">slides from last night's 
presentation on XLinks and XPointers</a>
to the XML SIG of the Object Developers' Group. This was adapted from Chapters <a href="books/bible/updates/16.html">16</a> 
and <a href="books/bible/17.html">17</a> of
<cite>The XML Bible</cite>. I started with the HTMLized version of those
chapters as posted here on Cafe con Leche.  I added various XML markup to split 
them into individual slides, bullet points, and examples while simultaneously
cutting them down to a size appropriate for a presentation.
I also had to clean up the original HTML so it would be well-formed XML. 
An XSL style sheet and James Clark's XT were used to generate the actual slides
in HTML. The presentation itself was delivered from a Web browser 
reading the HTML files off the local hard disk. It would have been equally easy 
to do it straight from the
Web. 
</p>

<p>They key developments that made this possible were the HTML output method in the
latest draft of XSL (so I didn't have to worry about whether browsers could understand
constructs like <code>&lt;br/&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/hr&gt;</code>)
and the <code>xt:document</code> extension function (so I could put each 
<code>slide</code> element in the 
input document into a separate file).  This also made it very straight-forward
to generate differently styled versions of the presentation for
printing transparencies, reading directly on the internet,
projecting onto a wall, and speaker's notes. For example, the online version you can read here 
simply uses the browser's default fonts. However, the versions designed for
projecting onto a wall use 16-point body text and bold monospaced fonts so they can more easily be read from the back of the room. 
The print versions
don't include navigation links. The onscreen versions do. 
I think I'm going to do all my presentations this way in the future.

<p>
The W3C has posted new working drafts of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt">XSL Transformations</a> 
and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath">XPath</a>.
I'll be updating my tutorials this weekend. Last call for comments on these is September 2
(which seems a little premature to me).  
</p>

<p>
Major changes and additions to XSLT include:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>The <code>current()</code> function that returns a node set containing only the current node being processed<p>
	<li>The <code>result-ns</code>, <code>result-version</code>, <code>result-encoding</code> and <code>indent-result</code> attributes of the <code>xsl:stylesheet</code> element
have been all been replaced by the top-level <code>xsl:output</code> element.<p>
	<li>The <code>xsl:value-of</code> and <code>xsl:text</code> elements now 
	have a <code>disable-output-escaping</code> attribute that can turn off the autmatic translation of &lt;, &gt; and &amp; to  &amp;lt;, &amp;gt;, and &amp;amp;. This has the effect of allowing essentially arbirtrary output from XSL transformations, not merely transformations to other well-formed XML documents.<p> 
	<li>the <code>default-space</code> attribute of <code>xsl:stylesheet</code> has been removed; instead the <code>xsl:strip-space</code> and  <code>xsl:preserve-space</code> elements can use wildcards
</ul>

<p>
There are a lot of minor changes and clarifications besides to the behavior of existing elements and attributes.
</p>

<p>
The changes to XPath syntax are relatively minor, though the specification document has also been cleaned up and rewritten. The largest is that 
the <code>namespace()</code> and <code>local-part()</code> functions have been renamed to <code>namespace-uri()</code> and <code>local-name()</code> 
respectively.
Most of the other changes won't be noticed.
</p>
<p>
James Clark has updated his <a href="http://www.jclark.com/xml/xt.html">XT</a> XSLT formatter
to suport these latest working drafts. This release is substantially more complete than
previous releases. As well as supporting the latest syntax, it supports various pieces 
that have not previously been implemented though they were present in previous drafts 
including
</p>


<ul>
	<li>the <code>substring()</code> and <code>string-length()</code> functions
	<li>the <code>document()</code> function for processing multiple input documents
	<li>the <code>unparsed-entity-uri()</code> function
	<li>attribute sets
</ul>

<p>
Additionally this release adds a Java
servlet wrapper and
support for multiple output documents by an extension
element.

outselling <cite>XML: Extensible Markup Language</cite> for the first time.
 <cite>XML: Extensible Markup Language</cite> is going into its third printing
 soon, but I do recommend people buy <cite>The XML Bible</cite> instead.
 It's much more comprehensive and up to date.  <a href="http://www.fatbrain.com/shop/info/0764532367?from=NYPKMP">FatBrain</a>
 has sold out of its initial shipment of
 <cite>The XML Bible</cite>, but should have more soon.

Lots of new and revised working drafts from the W3C today, including:
</p>
<ul>

    <li>The first incomplete, public working draft of 
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/1999/08/WD-smil-boston-19990803/">SMIL "Boston"</a>, 
    the follow-up to the Synchronized
 Multimedia Integration Language 1.0.  <p> 
	<li>A new working draft of
	<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/">Scalable Vector Graphics</a> (SVG)
	with new chapters on <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/fonts.html">fonts</a> and 
	<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/linking.html">linking</a> as well as many other 
    changes <p>
    <li>A first working draft of the
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-USERAGENT">User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0</a> 
to tell browser and plug-in vendors how to make their products more
accessible to visually challenged users while simultaneously increasing
usability for all users.  A related document is
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-USERAGENT-TECHS">Techniques for User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0</a>. <p>
<li> <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/becss">Behavioral Extensions to CSS</a> for 
event handling and scripting <p>
<li> The first CSS3 module: <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS3-selectors">W3C selectors</a>
for choosing which elements get which styles. This draft suggests attribute value selectors,
relative position based selectors, and more. This might help make CSS a more plausible alternative
to XSL for many medium complexity tasks. <p>

For those who judge books by their cover, you can now see the cover of 
<cite>The XML Bible</cite> on your left.
I've also got a <a href="books/bible/largebiblecover.jpg">larger 24-bit JPEG of the cover</a> 
that really looks quite nice. IDG's cover artists did an excellent job with this book. 
</p>

<p>
<cite>The XML Bible</cite> broke Amazon's top 2000 today, reaching at least as high as 1,799.
A repeatable bug in amazon's system moves books that sell out too quickly
back into the "Not Yet Published" category where <cite>The XML Bible</cite> sits now.
But it has been published, and if you <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0764532367/cafeaulaitA/">pre-order from Amazon</a> today, 
you'll get it just as soon as IDG can
get more books from their warehouse to Amazon's (maybe even quicker if they ship directly
from Ingram).  I haven't yet seen it in stock at any other online bookstore, but
I did notice that <a href="http://search.borders.com/fcgi-bin/db2www/search/search.d2w/Details?&mediaType=Book&prodID=51340151">Borders</a> 
listed it for $5.00 cheaper than everybody else.

<cite>The XML Bible</cite> 
is in stock for 24-hour shipment at 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0764532367/cafeaulaitA/">amazon.com</a>.
They still don't have a screen shot of the cover, though :-(
<strong>Update</strong>: that was quick. Less than two hours after I announced it here,
Amazon's sold out and have placed it back on 1-2 weeks shipment. They'll probably have 
more sooner than 
that though, based on past experience.
</p>



<p>
<cite>The XML Bible</cite> is the second edition (in everything but name)
of my previous best-seller, <cite>XML: Extensible Markup Language</cite>.
However, topping out at over 1000 pages (vs. 400 for the previous book) there's more
new material here than old. And all the older material has been substantially revised, rewritten, 
and expanded based on both reader comments and my own growing understanding of XML over the last
year. <cite>The XML Bible</cite> costs $10 more than <cite>XML: Extensible Markup Language</cite>
($49.95 vs. $39.95) but for that $10 you get over two and a half times as much stuff, so I think
it's a pretty good value. <code>:-)</code>  
</p>

<p>
<cite>The XML Bible</cite> is also up to date with all
XML specifications as of July 1, 1999. Unfortunately several specifications for XSL, 
XLinks, and XPointers were revised 
July 9, 1999 just as the book was going to the printers. <code>:-(</code>
I've posted <a href="books/bible/updates/">revised versions of all affected chapters</a> 
online here at Cafe con Leche
and plan to continue doing so as the various 
specifications grow and evolve toward their final incarnations.

</p>

<p>
<cite>The XML Bible</cite> is a comprehensive introduction to XML for Web page design. 
It shows you
how to write XML documents, validate them with DTDs, design CSS and XSL style sheets for
those documents, convert them to HTML, and publish them on Web servers for the world to
read. You'll also learn how to use XML technologies like RDF, XLinks, XHTML, and namespaces to
add structure and organization to your document collections. And finally, you'll learn about the
many uses of XML beyond the Web site, including genealogy, subscription services,
mathematics, vector graphics, and more. 
</p>

<p>
Unlike most other XML books on the market, <cite>The XML Bible</cite> covers XML not from the
perspective of a software developer but rather that of a Web page author. It doesn't spend a lot
of pages talking about BNF grammars or parsing element trees. Instead it shows you how you
can use XML and existing tools today to more efficiently and productively produce attractive,
exciting, easy-to-use, easy-to-maintain Web sites that will keep your readers coming back for
more.
</p>

<p>
This book is aimed squarely at Web site developers. I assume you want to use XML to produce
Web sites that are difficult to impossible to create with raw HTML. You'll be amazed to discover
that in conjunction with style sheets and a few free tools, XML lets you do things that previously
required either custom software costing hundreds to thousands of dollars per developer or
extensive knowledge of programming languages like Perl. None of the software in this book will
cost you more than a few minutes of download time. None of the tricks require any
programming.
</p>

<p>
<cite>The XML Bible</cite> should be available now at a bookstore near you including 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0764532367/cafeaulaitA/">amazon.com</a>.
It's $49.95, ISBN 0-7645-3236-7, published by IDG Books, and written by me, Elliotte Rusty Harold.
You can read more about it on my <a href="books/bible/">XML Bible page</a>

<p> Sun's posted a Java Specification Request for an <a href="http://java.sun.com/aboutJava/communityprocess/jsr/jsr_031_xmld.html">XML data-binding facility for the
Java Platform</a>. According to the proposal, "Such a facility compiles an XML schema into one
or more Java classes. These automatically-generated classes
handle the translation between XML documents that follow the
schema and interrelated instances of the derived classes. They
also ensure that the constraints expressed in the schema are
maintained as instances of the classes are manipulated." </p>

IBM's alphaWorks has released an <a href="http://www.alphaWorks.ibm.com/formula/xml/">experimental version of

Beta 1 of the <a href="http://www.xmls.com/software/exeter/xmlserver/">Exeter XML Server</a> is now available.
This is a straight-forward Web server for NT that can automatically apply XSL stylesheets to

I've posted three complete chapters from the XML Bible here on Cafe con Leche:
</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="books/bible/updates/14.html">Chapter 14: XSL Transformations</a></li>
      <li><a href="books/bible/updates/16.html">Chapter 16: XLinks</a></li>
      <li><a href="books/bible/updates/17.html">Chapter 17: XPointers</a></li>
    </ul>

<p>
All three are completely up-to-date with the latest working drafts 
of their respective specifications.  I wish I could say the same 
about the printed book, but unfortunately the lead time inherent in dead tree 
publishing means that there's about a two-month lag between the last 
opportunity to make changes and the time the book hits store shelves; and that's 
more than enough time for a lot to change in the fast moving world of XML.
Still out of 23 chapters and several appendixes, all but 3 are still current; 
and that's better than average in this market. The printed version of 
the <cite>XML Bible</cite> will be available on
August 10, though some bookstores may take a little longer than others
to get it in stock. Amazon pretty reliably sells out of my books within
a day or two of getting their first copies in stock, so
you may wish to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0764532367/cafeaulaitA">pre-order 
a copy</a> if you buy your computer books from them.

The W3C has posted a new <a href="http://www.w3.org/1999/07/WD-xlink-19990726">working 
draft of the XLink specification</a>.
Surprisingly, this isn't all that far removed from
the last draft thast was published more than a year ago.
This draft eliminates content-role, content-title,
and behavior attributes as well as attribute renaming. 
It adds the concept of an arc for bidirectional links.
And it makes much heavier use of namespaces.
But the actual semantics of XLinks change relatively little, and the overall
syntax changes are mostly search and replace fixable.
It's not nearly as big a change as the latest drafts of XPath, XPointer, and XSL Transformations.

Ronald Bourret's released the first alpha of <a href="http://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/DVS1/staff/bourret/xmldbms/xmldbms.htm">XML-DBMS</a>, 
a set of Java
packages for transferring data between XML documents and relational
databases. According to Bourrett, "It views the XML document as a tree of objects in which element
types are generally classes and attributes and PCDATA properties of those
classes. It then uses an object-relational mapping to map these objects to
the database. An XML-based mapping language is used to define the view and
map it to the database." This software is free.

The W3C has posted a new working draft of

This draft changes almost everything about XPointers except their ultimate purpose
as a means of locating arbitrary fragments

The W3C has posted a new working draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-xslt">XSL Transformations</a>
(just a couple of days after I turned in the final correctons for the
<cite>XML Bible</cite>, damn it :-( ). 
The biggest change is that the expression language has been pulled
out into a new specification and renamed  
 <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath">XPath</a> so it can be shared with XPointer.
 Most of the other changes are fairly minor. Most stylesheets can migrate to the new
 draft simply by renaming a fee of the less common elements and attributes like
<code>n-digits-per-group</code>. The extension function mechanism has been extensively 
revised and cleaned up. Probably the biggest change is to the non-abbreviated selection syntax,
now part of XPath, where items like <code>from-children(BOOK)</code> and
<code>from-attributes(ISBN)</code> are now <code>children::BOOK</code> and
<code>attributes::ISBN</code>.
None of the available formatting engines yet implement this working draft.

Beta 1 of version 3.0 of the

This is the server used in Philip Greenspun's

For the first time, AOLServer is being released under an open source license

with it for a few years, AOL finally realized selling Web server
software didn't fit into their business model
and wanted to get rid of it the simplest way possible.)

The IETF has released the first draft standard version of HTTP 1.1.
This is more final than it sounds. New features include:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The client must tell the server what system it's connecting to so
	multihoming can be implemented on one IP address</li>
	<li>Compressed file transfer using gzip</li>
	<li>Persistent connections so there's less TCP overhead per page</li>
	<li>Partial file transfer</li>
	<li>More detailed response codes</li>
	<li>Encryption of passwords so they're no longer sent between client and server in the clear</li>
</ul>

<p>
This really only scratches the surface of what's new in HTTP 1/1. The entire document is almost 200 pages.
Many of these features are already supported by current Web servers.

Omnimark has made version 5 of its Omnimark 
Windows scripting 
language available for <a href="http://www.omnimark.com/develop/product-download.html">free</a> 
for the first time.  I'd still prefer an open source implementation,
but this is a nice step.  Although a lot of people rave about Omnimark, I've pretty
much ignored it until now because of a general aversion to
proprietary payware programming languages. The IDE is still $995 payware.
You have to download the IDE to get the langauge, but I'm told you can install just the language.

XSL Transformations (XSLT) Specification
Version 1.0</a>.  Apparently they have decided to split XSL into two separate specifications for
transformations and formatting objects.  From the spec:

<blockquote><p>
This draft is intended to be "feature complete". The Working Group plans to use future drafts to stabilize
the current functionality; it does not intend to add any new functionality in version 1.0.
</p>

<p>
The XSL WG and the XML Linking WG have agreed to unify XSLT expressions and XPointers [XPointer]. A
common core semantic model for querying has been agreed upon, and this draft follows this model (see
[6.1 Location Paths]). However, further changes particularily in the syntax will probably be necessary.

I'm only about 9 megabytes into the 40+ megabyte download of Internet Explorer 5.0
so I don't have much to say about it yet. (Microsoft's download site keeps disconnecting 
me. I blame NT for that.) However I did note that this release has
optional support for Hebrew and Arabic pages for the first time. Surprisingly,
however, it won't run on Hebrew or Arabic localized versions of Windows.

Dave Winer <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1999/03/everyonesEquallyNasty">noted</a> 
that IE5.0 uses Alexa to track the Web sites you visit. There are big privacy problems here,
though perhaps not as serious as Netscape's.

Dan Shafer</a> and <a href="http://www.xml.com/xml/pub/1999/03/ie5/first-x.html">Tim Bray</a>

<li> SAXON Stylesheets produce a text file, not a tree. This means you can use
them to produce CSV files, EDI messages, SQL scripts, or any number of

 XML Standard Extension
Specification</a> on the Java Developer Connection (registration required).
Only one week has been allotted for comment. 
Personally I'm a little perturbed by this proposal since it more or less
ignores a lot of ongoing, community based work on XML APIs like SAX and
ModSAX. If Sun were serious about supporting XML, they'd contribute to those efforts
instead of trying to do it all in-house. But of course if they participated 
in an open, democratic forum they couldn't control the outcome for their own benefit.
This is
yet another example of Sun using its control of
Java to put its grubby, proprietary hands all over 
 any technology it wants to own. Comments can be sent to

NEC has submitted a note about the

Description Language</a> (PIDL) to the W3C.
Given the obvious pronunuciation of the acronym,
it's perhaps not surprising that this proposal appears to have been
written by non-native English speakers.
One wonders what other names they considered{? Perhaps the 
"Universal Replacement In Notation Appended To End"?
or the "Personal Information Suffix System"?
In any case, despite the name and my grammar school 
level musings about it, the idea looks interesting. 
According to the note:
</p>

<blockquote> PIDL provides a common
framework for applications to progressively process original
contents and append personalized versions in a compact format.
PIDL supports the personalization of different media (e.g. plain
text, structured text, graphics, etc), multiple personalization
methods (such as filtering, sorting, replacing, etc) and
different delivery methods (for example SMTP, HTTP,
IP-multicasting, etc).

In the latest example of patent idiocy, the U.S. Patent Office

significant parts of both CSS and XSL, US5860073: Style sheets for publishing

Microsoft ignored its obligation to inform the W3C
of its pending patent application on the technology when
it was "participating" in the development of CSS.
</p>
<p>
This is a very bad patent that ignores much prior art, and will
probably be invalidated quickly. Nonetheless it does demonstrate

<blockquote>MDSAX (Multi-Document Simple API for XML) is a set of tools for working with Java
SAX parsers and parser filters. MDSAX provides developers with considerably more control
over the creation and stacking order of SAX filters, and makes it simple for programs to
specify different filter stacks for different types of documents (as identified by their root
elements.) Factory classes make it possible to construct and initialize filters to take full
advantage of all of their features without extensive custom coding. MDSAX also provides
access to a number of services, allowing filters to communicate amongst themselves and with

Version 1.0 of the <a href="http://birk105.studby.uio.no/www_work/xsa/">XSA specification</a> has been released.
XSA is an XML-based system that allows anyone who is interested to
automatically discover new versions of software products as they are
released by polling XML documents describing the products. It is
mainly intended to help software index maintainers keep their indexes
up to date.

The Unicode Consortium has created a new $600, non-voting
<a href="http://www.unicode.org/unicode/consortium/join.html">Specialist Membership</a>
for individuals.
Specialist members will have full access to the member areas of the Unicode
web and ftp sites.  They can participate freely in UTC meetings as
non-voting members, and they will receive a discount at Unicode
conferences.  While I would prefer allowing specialist members
to vote, this is definitely a step forward.  In particular,
I hope the W3C follows the Unicode Consortium's example.

The W3C has formally elevated <a href="http://www.w3c.org/TR/REC-xml-names">Namespaces in XML</a> to full recommendation status.
I'm a little surprised at this. While I don't have strong opinions
about this one way or the other, it was quite clear that this specification
doesn't have anything approaching a consensus of the interested parties. 
Nor is it obvious that the concerns of the dissenters can be addressed in a 
future revision that doesn't break backward compatibility.  In my opinion,
the W3C moved too quickly on this controversial issue.

According to IBM 
</p>

<blockquote><p>
DataCraft is an application generation tool targeted for
RDF/XML applications in the context of Web-commerce
applications. DataCraft, a facility capable of generating visual query
skeletons and running the queries against DB2, is an excellent tool
for Web-Database application generation using XML. 
</p>

<p>
DataCraft provides client tools visually navigating resource schema,
and query language building queries visually from the schema
based on XML and RDF. DataCraft uses RDF and XML to describe
data collection structures and to exchange resource schema and
query between the server and client. DataCraft is written in JAVA
and can be accessed by web browsers. Currently, DataCraft
supports relational data servers such as IBM DB2 or Microsoft
Access.
