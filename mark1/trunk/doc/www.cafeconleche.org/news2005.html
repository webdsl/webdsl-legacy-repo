The Eclipse Project has released <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/webtools/">Web Tools 1.0</a>, a collection of XML and Web Services editors for the open source Eclipse IDE. 
I've not been incredibly impressed with this. As XML editors go, it's pretty weak, certainly not up to the level of Oxygen, for example. Both features and user  interface don't seem to be closely tied to how XML is actually edited. 
Starting with the installation process, 
you feel like you're fighting with the tool rather than working with it.
It's not obvious to me that the programmers working on this had a clear vision of how an XML (or web services) editor should work. Instead it looks like they simply made a checklist of features  which were then implemented independently without any real integration between the people working on different pieces. 
I'd be extremely surprised if any actual user testing was done on this.
The whole project makes the classic open source
mistake of focusing on how the developers view the project instead of how users see it. 
Eclipse 3.1.1 is required, but frankly I wouldn't bother. This software is a turkey. 
Leave it on the farm.

<p> Dennis Sosnoski has released <a
href="http://jibx.sourceforge.net/index.html">JiBX 1.0</a>, yet
another  open source (BSD license) framework for binding XML data to Java
objects using your own class structures. It falls into the
custom-binding document camp as opposed to the schema driven
binding frameworks like JaxMe and JAXB.
Quoting from the JiBX web
site, </p>

<blockquote> 
<p>JiBX is a framework for binding XML data to Java objects. It
lets you work with data from XML documents using your own class
structures. The JiBX framework handles all the details of converting
your data to and from XML based on your instructions. JiBX is designed
to perform the translation between internal data structures and XML with
very high efficiency, but still allows you a high degree of control
over the translation process.</p>

<p>How does it manage this? JiBX uses <a href="tutorial/binding-tutorial.html"><i>binding
definition</i></a>
documents to define the rules for how your Java objects are converted to
or from XML (the <em>binding</em>). At some point after you've compiled
your source code into class files you execute the first part of the
JiBX framework, the <a href="bindcomp.html"><i>binding compiler</i></a>. This compiler enhances
binary class files produced by the Java compiler, adding code to handle
converting instances of the classes to or from XML. After running the
binding compiler you can continue the normal steps you take in assembling your
application (such as building jar files, etc.). You can also skip the binding
compiler as a separate step and instead bind classes
<a href="bindonload.html">directly at runtime</a>, though this approach has some
drawbacks.</p>

<p>The second part of the JiBX framework is the <a href="runtime.html"><i>binding
runtime</i></a>. The enhanced class files generated by the binding
compiler use this runtime component both for actually building objects
from an XML input document (called <i>unmarshalling</i>, in data
binding terms) and for generating an XML output document from objects
(called <i>marshalling</i>). The runtime uses a parser implementing
the XMLPull API for handling input documents, but is otherwise
self-contained.</p>

The Mozilla Project has posted the first beta of  <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/seamonkey/">SeaMonkey 1.0</a>. 
This is the continuation of the integrated Mozilla suite, and has XML support roughly equivalent to Firefox 1.5 (e.g. XML, XSLT, CSS, XHTML, etc.)  There's something to be said for having the e-mail client, web editor, browser, and more rolled into one application. However, there's little to be said for maintaining the same ugly user interface of the old Mozilla builds. I didn't realize it until I switched back after surfing with Firefox for some months, and then tried switching back;
but there's more to Firefox than just a stripped down Mozilla.
I can't quite put my finger on it, but Firefox just looks prettier than Mozilla/SeaMonkey does. It sounds trivial, but if you try using both I think you'll vastly prefer Firefox.

The Mozilla Project has also released   <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/thunderbird/">Thunderbird 1.5</a>. 
I've been using Thunderbird for the last few months as well.
however I was just about to give up on it because an <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=206408">interaction of several different bugs</a> in Thunderbird and IBiblio's overloaded IMAP server was forcing me to quit and relaunch Thunderbird every fifteen minutes or so. Fingers crossed, but the final 
1.5 release seems to have fixed or at least drastically reduced
 those problems. I haven't seen them since upgrading two days ago.
There are still some <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=12916">missing</a> <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=243543">features</a>, but overall Thunderbird seems to be the best mail client currently available on the Mac.
It's vastly superior to Apple Mail, Outlook, and even the Eudora that I'd been using for ten years previously.

for example, it is now possible to disable and hide particular
application settings, which comes in handy for central administration in
networks. Moreover, a new keyboard shortcut permits the user to return
to a saved cursor position. The bullets and numbering feature has been
expanded, and a new mail merge feature is available.
Last but not least, Macedonian has been added as an official language."

Microsoft is <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mac/products/internetexplorer/internetexplorer.aspx?pid=internetexplorer">officially halting distribution of 
Internet Explorer for the Mac</a> at the end of next month.
You'll probably want to archive a copy or two now for testing purposes, as well as to use with sites like the Proximus wireless "access" point at 
Javapolis last week that wouldn't let anybody in unless they were using IE.
This had more than a little to do with the silence of my sites over the last week, as well as the paucity of reports from what was a quite interesting show for those who were there.
Poor wireless access (the IE requirement was not the only problem) meant 
relatively few people were able to chat about or report from the show in real time.
 </p>

<p>
Putting such blatantly bad design on display in front of an audience of 2000 alpha geeks, almost every one of whom could probably explain in intimate detail exactly what
 Proximus did wrong, is not exactly the smartest viral marketing a company might do. 
In fact, that's an idea. Next year let's do a reverse keynote where the CEO and CTO of Proximus have to stand in front of the convention and listen to everyone in the audience tell them how to fix their broken system. It used to be that only internal users suffered through such brain damage and poor design; but with web apps everyone gets to see just how incompetent your team really is.
Hmm, there's another idea. How about a mutual fund that makes investment decisions by analyzing a company's public web applications to figure out which companies hire the pointy-haired and which don't?

I've posted the notes from my <a href="slides/javapolis/xom/">XOM Design Principles</a> and 
<a href="slides/javapolis/effectivexml/">Effective XML</a> talks at Javapolis. The latter is a very different talk than the ones of the same name I've given in the past. This is a more basic talk focussing on introducing XML and best practices at the same time. 
This conference asked me to give a talk that could cover all levels from novice to advanced. I'm not sure that really worked. It's hard to go fast enough to interest the experienced users
without leaving the beginners behind. 
I'm planning on giving a re-titled version of this talk at SD 2006 West in Santa Clara next March, but that will be focused more directly at beginners. <!-- Even then it's a lot faster than I used to go. This used too be three days worth of material.
However now there's a lot less interest in or time for 
basic XML. -->

</p>

<img src="images/wordbinary.png" alt="Documented corrupted by Microsoft Word" width="422" height="402" hspace="5" vspace="5" border="0" />

<p>
In fact, it's the binary hash Microsoft Word made out of Chapter 24 in my next book. I'm not certain, but the proximate cause seems to be editing the file with both Office 97 on Windows and Office 2004 on the Mac.
Fortunately I had a backup of this document from yesterday morning,
and yesterday was more of a research and coding day than a writing day, so I didn't lose too much. Still if 
Microsoft can't even keep their
file formats stable and reliable for one decade, why do they expect 
governments to use them for archival storage?

I've posted the initial notes for <a href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/slides/poly/syndication/">Syndication: RSS, ATOM, OPML, and All That</a>.
This session focuses on explaining RSS and ATOM to software developers (as opposed to content authors). In other words, it delves into the nitty gritty of how these systems work, and explains how to write software that generates and consumes feeds. 
I presented this lecture in my XML class at Polytechnic Thursday night.
I was planning it for about 
90 minutes, but I think it might need more like three hours to really do justice to the material. I didn't even get into the section on the Atom Publishing Protocol. 
</p>
<hr />
<p>
Hopefully I'll have an opportunity or two to develop this session further, and present it at some conferences and user groups over the coming year. 
Drop me an e-mail if you'd like me to talk to your user group, company, or conference about this. In fact, it occurs to me that there might be some interest in this at some conferences that aren't specifically focused on XML: e.g. web conferences, Ruby conferences, PHP conferences, etc. The technology is pretty important and fairly language and platform agnostic. 
if you hear of any Calls for Proposals for conferences that might be interested in a session or two on this subject, especially conferences that are willing to pay speakers, please 
<a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;elharo%40metalab%2Eunc%2Eedu?Subject=RSS%20conference">drop me a line</a>. Thanks.

Speaking of conferences, I've updated the <a href="tradeshows.html">conferences page</a> with dates and info for Extreme Markup Languages 2006 (August 7-11 in Montreal) and XML 2006 (November 13-17 in Seattle). I probably won't be at Extreme this year. I'm thinking I may go to XML 2006 though. I'm up in the air about XTech 2006 (May 16-19, Amsterdam). These are all good shows, but they pay bupkus; so it's difficult to justify going to all three every year. I will definitely be at <a href="http://www.sdexpo.com/">Software Development West 2006</a> in Santa Clara in March though.

<a href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera Software</a> has posted preview releases of  
version 9.0 of their namesake free-beer
web browser for <a href="http://snapshot.opera.com/windows/w90p1.html">Windows</a>, <a href="http://snapshot.opera.com/unix/u90p1.html">Unix</a>,  and the <a href="http://snapshot.opera.com/mac/">Mac</a>. 
Most notably this release (finally!) adds support for XSLT. At least they say it does. In my tests, it couldn't render <a href="tradeshows.xml">this XML page styled with XSLT</a>.
Other XMLish improvements include more accurate CSS rendering,
Web Forms 2.0,  Apple's <code>canvas</code> element, Atom 1.0, <code>xml:id</code>,
<em>removes</em> support for XML namespaces in HTML documents,
and 
can re-parse invalid XML documents as HTML after XML parsing has failed.

<p>
I'm pleased to announce the release of  
<a href="http://www.xom.nu/">XOM 1.1</a>, my free-as-in-speech (LGPL)
dual streaming/tree-based API for processing XML with Java.
Version 1.1 maintains backwards compatibility with XOM 1.0 while adding a number of important new features including XPath queries, document subset canonicalization, exclusive XML canonicalization,
external XSLT parameters, and <code>xml:id</code> support. It also fixes a number of bugs that were present in XOM 1.0, uses less memory,
and is two to four times faster for many common operations.
</p>

<p>
The addition of XPath is especially significant. It removes the last remaining reason you might plausibly choose 
JDOM or dom4j instead of XOM. 
Going forward I think you'll find that XOM is more robust, faster, smaller, better documented, and much, much easier to use than the alternatives. While there's a lot of working legacy code out there using JDOM or dom4j that no one's going to throw away, new projects should seriously consider XOM. In my not so humble opinion, it is demonstrably the best library of its type. There are still use cases for which one would choose a pure streaming API such as SAX, StAX, or XNI instead.
However if you want an XML tree model in Java, XOM is the obvious choice.

The Mozilla Project has released
 <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/firefox/">Firefox 1.5</a>.
       New features in 1.5 for XML developers 
       include:
       </p>
       
 <ul>
	<li>      CSS @-moz-document selector for matching on site/document URL, useful in user stylesheets</li>

	<li>SVG support is now turned on by default.   </li>
  
	<li>XML Events in JavaScript  </li>

	<li>An extension to support XForms</li>
  
	<li>CSS 2 quotes support</li>

	<li>CSS 2 counters support</li>

	<li>Lots of neat CSS 3 features</li>

	<li>URIs are now always encoded in UTF-8</li>
	<li>Partial support for E4X</li>
</ul>

<p>Other new features in 1.5 include:</p>
       
<ul>
	<li>Sanitize "provides an easy way to quickly remove browsing history, cookies, cache, saved form information, and other personal data. The items to be removed can be customized, and the feature can be activated using either a keyboard shortcut or through a menu item."</li>

	<li>When viewing images, tab icons now display thumbnails of the displayed image.</li>

	<li>"Much faster session history navigation. The feature is off by default but can be enabled for testing purposes by setting the browser.sessionhistory.max_viewers preference to a nonzero number."</li>

	<li>FTP users are prompted for a name and password if anonymous access fails.</li>

  
	<li>Report a broken website wizard</li>

	<li>Changes made in the Preferences window now apply immediately</li>

	<li>Searchable download actions manager</li>

	<li>Searchable cookie manager</li>
</ul>

<p>
       I've been using 1.5 since the alpha 2 
       release a few months ago.
       It feels a little slower than 1.0 but otherwise has been 
       quite stable. There do not appear to be any significant changes since the last release candidate.

The W3C Web Accessibility Initiative
Protocols and Formats Working Group
has published a note on the 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/NOTE-turingtest-20051123/">Inaccessibility of CAPTCHA:
Alternatives to Visual Turing Tests on the Web</a>.
According to the note,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Web sites with resources that are attractive to aggregators (travel and event 
  ticket sites, etc.) or other forms of automation (Web-based email, weblogs and 
  message boards) have taken measures to ensure that they can offer their service 
  to individual users without having their content harvested or otherwise exploited 
  by Web robots.</p>
<p>The most popular solution at present is the use of graphical representations 
  of text in registration or comment areas. The site attempts to verify that the 
  user in question is in fact a human by requiring the user to read a distorted 
  set of characters from a bitmapped image, then enter those characters into a 
  form.</p>
<p>Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University have pioneered this method, which 
  they have called <acronym title="Completely Automated Public Turing 
  test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart">CAPTCHA</acronym> (Completely Automated Public Turing 
  test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart) [<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/NOTE-turingtest-20051123/#ref-CAPTCHA">CAPTCHA</a>]. 
  Various groups are at work on projects based on or similar to this original, 
  and for the purpose of this paper, the term "CAPTCHA" is used to refer to all 
  of these projects collectively. A Turing test [<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/NOTE-turingtest-20051123/#ref-TURING">TURING</a>], 
  named after famed computer scientist Alan Turing, is any system of tests designed 
  to differentiate a human from a computer.</p>
<p>This type of visual and textual verification comes at a huge price to users 
  who are blind, visually impaired or dyslexic. Naturally, this image has no text 
  equivalent accompanying it, as that would make it a giveaway to computerized 
  systems. In many cases, these systems make it impossible for users with certain 
  disabilities to create accounts, write comments, or make purchases on these 
  sites, that is, CAPTCHAs fail to properly recognize users with disabilities 
  as human.</p>

Version 1.1 maintains backwards compatibility with XOM 1.0 while adding a number of important new features including XPath queries, document subset canonicalization, exclusive XML canonicalization,
external XSLT parameters, and <code>xml:id</code> support. 
The API is now considered to be stable, and probably won't change before 1.1 final. 
Beta 7 fixes two minor, almost cosmetic bugs in the <code>Serializer</code> and  plugs a possible memory leak in the <code>Builder</code>. 
Barring discovery of any more bugs,
this should be the last beta before the final release of XOM 1.1 next week.
I'd really appreciate it if anyone who's been using it could give this release candidate a spin to make sure the latest fixes haven't broken anything else. 
XOM requires Java 1.2 or later and is published under the LGPL.

Michael Kay has released version 8.6.1 of Saxon, his XSLT 2.0 and XQuery processor. This release adds a new <code>saxon:deep-equal()</code> extension function that "is similar to fn:deep-equal() but with an extra parameter to control the precise details of how the comparison is done. This was found useful as a means of comparing test results for the XQTS test suite with the published results."
Assorted bugs are fixed as well.
Saxon is published in two versions for both of which 
Java 1.4 or later is required.
<a href="http://saxon.sf.net/">Saxon 8.6B</a> is an open source product  
published under the Mozilla Public License 1.0 that 
"implements the 'basic' conformance level for XSLT 2.0 and XQuery."
Saxon <a href="http://www.saxonica.com/">8.6SA</a> is a 
£250.00 payware version that "allows stylesheets and queries to import an XML Schema, to validate input and output trees against a schema, and to select elements and attributes based on their schema-defined type. Saxon-SA also incorporates a free-standard XML Schema validator.
In addition Saxon-SA incorporates some advanced extensions not available in the Saxon-B product. These include a try/catch capability for catching dynamic errors, improved error diagnostics, support for higher-order functions, and additional facilities in XQuery including support for grouping, advanced regular expression analysis, and formatting of dates and numbers."

I think I've finally found a decent RSS browser. <a href="http://www.opencommunity.co.uk/vienna2.html">Vienna</a> is an open source client for Mac OS X that satisfies all my <a href="oldnews/news2005August4.html">must have items</a>, including newsfeed aggregation, OPML import and export, easy keyboard navigation, and more. There are no obvious bugs or user interface glitches. (OK. I found one minor glitch. It confirms deleting feeds rather than allowing the deletion to be undone. that's an extremely common mistake. More on that topic on another site soon. )</p>

<p>
In one respect, it even exceeds my requirements. I had asked for a browser that hides all read news items, which it can do. However, it also lets me delete news items individually. Thus I can save the items I may want to reread or come back to while deleting most things so I never see them again. Very slick! It also has a significant AppleScript dictionary. It's hard to judge the quality of such a thing without actually writing a few scripts for it, but it looks better than most commercial products. 
</p>

<p>
Vienna isn't written in Java, so I probably won't be able to contribute much back; but on the other hand I'm not sure I need to. It works pretty damn well out of the box.

Cocoon implements these concepts around the notion of 'component pipelines', each component on the pipeline specializing on a particular operation. This makes it possible to use a Lego(tm)-like approach in building web solutions, hooking together components into pipelines without any required programming."
 Cocoon can assemble data from many sources including filesystems, SQL databases, LDAP, native XML databases, and SAP. It can customize the output to generate HTML, WML, PDF, SVG, and RTF from the same inputs. 
Processes it supports include XSL transformation and XInclude resolution. 
Cocoon can run as a servlet inside an existing web server or
 standalone through a commandline interface. New features in 2.1.8 include:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Many enhancements to the forms block including AJAX support for partial updates to a form, a new tree widget, some experimental code for reusable form libraries (coded as a part of the Google Summer of Code project) and a sample showing how to create forms using relational databases with zero java code.</li>

	<li>Cocoon Stack Traces</li>

	<li>Many enhancements to the portal block, including improved caching mechanisms, support for the Web Services For Remote Portlets (WSRP) standard, and provided components for database access using OJB.</li>

	<li>A new JCR block allowing access to JCR repositories such as JackRabbit</li>

	<li>A new validation block providing the ability to validate XML in a pipeline chosing from a range of schema languages (DTD, XSD, RNG)</li>

candidate recommendation of <a
	href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/CR-ws-cdl-10-20051109/">Web Services Choreography Description Language Version 1.0</a>. According to the
	abstract, 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The Web Services Choreography Description Language (WS-CDL) is an XML-based language that describes peer-to-peer collaborations of participants by defining, from a global viewpoint, their common and complementary observable behavior; where ordered message exchanges result in accomplishing a common business goal.
</p>

<p>
The Web Services specifications offer a communication bridge between the heterogeneous computational environments used to develop and host applications. The future of E-Business applications requires the ability to perform long-lived, peer-to-peer collaborations between the participating services, within or across the trusted domains of an organization.
</p>

<p>
The Web Services Choreography specification is targeted for composing interoperable, peer-to-peer collaborations between any type of participant regardless of the supporting platform or programming model used by the implementation of the hosting environment.

"SKOS Core provides a model for expressing the basic structure and content of concept schemes such as thesauri, classification schemes, subject heading lists, taxonomies, 'folksonomies', other types of controlled vocabulary, and also concept schemes embedded in glossaries and terminologies.
The SKOS Core Vocabulary is an application of the Resource Description Framework (RDF), that can be used to express a concept scheme as an RDF graph. Using RDF allows data to be linked to and/or merged with other data, enabling data sources to be distributed across the web, but still be meaningfully composed and integrated."

Benjamin Pasero has released
of <a href="http://rssowl.sourceforge.net/">RSSOwl 1.2</a>, an open source RSS reader written in Java and based on the SWT toolkit. 
Version 1.2 adds assorted new features, most importantly support for Atom 1.0. 
RSSOwl is the best open source RSS client I've seen written in Java. 
That said, it still doesn't feel right to me. Even ignoring various small user interface inconsistencies, news just doesn't flow in this client.  
The goal of an RSS news reader is to help you get through large quantities of information quickly. RSSOwl doesn't do that. 
The biggest problem is that it doesn't treat read and unread items differently. If I've already read a news item, I don't want it to keep showing up when I'm paging through the news with the arrow key. I can use Command-N (Ctrl-N for Windows/Linux folk) to go to the next unread item. However, that's not enough. the arrow key and the space bar should both advance to the next unread item, rather than the next item. Furthermore, previously read items should be hidden by default. Usenet news readers have acted like this for years. Even Thunderbird can do this (and that feature has been a huge help in organizing and responding to my email). Why can't RSS readers do the same? (Actually, some can but these are all either closed source, or operate on platforms I don't use.)

Automatic Update just informed me that 
the Mozilla Project has released 
 <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/firefox/">Firefox 1.5</a>.
 (Looking at the web site it's actually Firefox 1.5 RC 1, not quite the final release version.)
 If you've been using one of the 1.5 betas, it may already be downloading now as you read this. 
       New features in 1.5 for XML developers 
       include:
       </p>
       
 <ul>
	<li>      CSS @-moz-document selector for matching on site/document URL, useful in user stylesheets</li>

	<li>SVG support is now turned on by default.   </li>
  
	<li>XML Events in JavaScript  </li>

	<li>An extension to support XForms</li>
  
	<li>CSS 2 quotes support</li>

	<li>CSS 2 counters support</li>

	<li>Lots of neat CSS 3 features</li>

	<li>URIs are now always encoded in UTF-8</li>
</ul>

<p>Other new features in 1.5 include:</p>
       
<ul>
	<li>Sanitize "provides an easy way to quickly remove browsing history, cookies, cache, saved form information, and other personal data. The items to be removed can be customized, and the feature can be activated using either a keyboard shortcut or through a menu item."</li>

	<li>When viewing images, tab icons now display thumbnails of the displayed image.</li>

	<li>"Much faster session history navigation. The feature is off by default but can be enabled for testing purposes by setting the browser.sessionhistory.max_viewers preference to a nonzero number."</li>

	<li>FTP users are prompted for a name and password if anonymous access fails.</li>

  
	<li>Report a broken website wizard</li>

	<li>Changes made in the Preferences window now apply immediately</li>

	<li>Searchable download actions manager</li>

	<li>Searchable cookie manager</li>
</ul>

<p>
"This release does not contain any major new features since Beta 1. Improvements to automated update system, Web site rendering and performance, along with several security fixes are included in this release
Beta 1 users that want to help test software update, should wait for the automatic update to be triggered sometime in the next few days. The incremental update from Beta 1 to Beta 2 is 700K bytes."
       I've been using this version since the alpha 2 
       release a few months ago.
       It feels a little slower than 1.0 but otherwise has been 
       quite stable.

</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The goals of the XML Processing Model Working Group are to
develop two Recommendation Track documents:</p>
<ol>
<li>An XML Processing Language which answers the following
questions:
<ol>
<li>What is to be done to a given document or a set of documents by
a given sequence of given XML processors?</li>
<li>Which data model (XML Information Set, PSVI, XPath 1.0, XQuery
1.0 and XPath 2.0) is manipulated by each transformation
process?</li>
<li>How are exceptions handled during processing?</li>
<li>What is the expected outcome after processing?</li>

</ol>
</li>
<li>An XML Processing Model which answers the following questions:
<ol>
<li>Which if any of the transformations signalled by aspects of an
XML document should be performed, and in what order? Examples of
transformations include, but are not limited to, XInclude, XML
Canonicalization (and/or Exclusive Canonicalization), XSLT, xml:id,
XML Signature and XML De/Encryption.</li>
<li>How can an author, consumer, or application guide this
process?</li>
<li>In the absence of any guidance, what default processing, if
any, should be done in what circumstances?</li>
<li>What will the impact of a default processing model be on
existing XML documents and processors, in particular DOM
implementations?</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It is also expected that the Working Group will take into
consideration potential consequences of processing XML documents
represented by alternative (e.g. efficient XML interchange)
serializations, or bundled together as compound documents or with
other packaging methods.</p>

I've posted the fifth beta of 
<a href="http://www.xom.nu/unstable.html">XOM 1.1</a>, my free-as-in-speech (LGPL)
dual streaming/tree-based API for processing XML with Java.
Version 1.1 maintains backwards compatibility with XOM 1.0 while adding a number of important new features including XPath queries, document subset canonicalization, exclusive XML canonicalization,
external XSLT parameters, and <code>xml:id</code> support. 
The API is now considered to be stable, and probably won't change before 1.1 final. 
Beta 5 fixes one bug in the Canonicalizer and makes a couple more
small optimizations. 
This may be the last beta before the final release of XOM 1.1. 
XOM requires Java 1.2 or later and is published under the LGPL.

XimpleWare has released  
<a href="http://vtd-xml.sf.net">VTD-XML 1.0</a>, a free (GPL) 
<a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/05/19/parsing.html">non-extractive</a> Java library for  processing XML that supports XPath.
This appears to be an example of what Sam Wilmot calls "in situ parsing". In other words, rather than creating objects representing the content of an XML document, VTD-XML just passes pointers into the actual, real XML.
(These are the abstract pointers of your data structures textbook, not C-style addresses in memory. In this cases the pointers are int indexes into the file.) YOu don't
even need to hold the document in memory. It can remain on disk. 
This should improve speed and memory usage.
Current tree models typically require at least 3 times the size of the actual document, more often more. Using a model based on indexes into one big array might allow these to reduce their requirements to twice the size of the original document or even less. VTD-XML claims 1.3 times, but I haven't verified that.
</p>

<p>
However VTD-XML currently 
"only supports built-in entity references(&amp;quot; &amp;amp; &amp;apos; &amp;gt; &amp;lt;)." That means it's not an XML parser. Given this,  comparisons to other parsers are unfair and misleading. I've seen many products that outperform real XML parsers by subsetting XML and cutting out the hard parts. It's often the last 10% that kills the performance. :-(
The other question I have for anything claiming these speed gains is whether it correctly implements well-formedness testing, including the internal DTD subset. Will VTD-XML correctly report all malformed documents as malformed? Has it been tested against the W3C XML conformance test suite? I'm not sure.
</p>

<p>
Finally, even if everything works out once the holes are plugged,  this seems like it would be slower than SAX/StAX for streaming use cases. VTD, like DOM, needs to read the entire document before it can work on any of it. SAX/StAX can begin processing the beginning of a document before most of the document has even arrived from the network. This isn't relevant to all use cases, but it's very relevant for many of the cases where speed is most critical and most problematic.

of
the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/PR-SMIL2-20050927/">Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL 2.1)</a>.
SMIL 2.1 has four goals:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Define an XML-based language that allows authors to write interactive
    multimedia presentations. Using SMIL, an author can describe the temporal
    behaviour of a multimedia presentation, associate hyperlinks with media
    objects and describe the layout of the presentation on a screen.</li>
  <li>Allow reusing of SMIL syntax and semantics in other XML-based
    languages, in particular those who need to represent timing and
    synchronization. For example, SMIL components are used for integrating
    timing into XHTML and into SVG.</li>
  <li>Extend the functionalities contained in the SMIL 2.0 into
    new or revised SMIL 2.1 modules.</li>
  <li>Define new SMIL 2.1 Mobile Profiles incorporating features useful
    within the mobile industry.</li>

The W3C HTML Working Group has posted the second working draft of
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-xframes-20051012">XFrames</a>. 
Accopprding to the introduction,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Frames were introduced into HTML at version 4.0 [HTML4]. They introduced a manner of composing several
HTML documents into a single view to create an application-like interface.</p>

<p>However, Frames introduced several usability problem that caused several
commentators to advise Web site builders to avoid them at all costs. Examples
of such usability problems are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The [back] button works unintuitively in many cases.</li>
  <li>You cannot bookmark a collection of documents in a frameset, or send
    someone a reference to the collection.</li>
  <li>If you do a [reload], the result may be different to what you had.</li>
  <li>[page up] and [page down] are often hard to do.</li>
  <li>You can get trapped in a frameset.</li>

  <li>Searching finds HTML pages, not Framed pages, so search results usually
    give you pages without the navigation context that they were intended to
    be in.</li>
  <li>Since you can't content negotiate, <code>noframes</code> markup is
    necessary for user agents that don't support frames. However, almost no
    one produces <code>noframes</code> content, and so it ruins Web searches,
    since search engines are examples of user agents that do not support
    frames.</li>
  <li>There are security problems caused by the fact that it is not visible
    to the user when different frames come from different sources.</li>
</ul>

<p>This document defines a separate XML application, not a part of XHTML <em xml:lang="lt" lang="lt">per se</em>, that allows similar functionality to
HTML Frames, with fewer usability problems, principally by making the content
of the frameset visible in its URI.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In itself, this seems fine. However, it really feels like there's a lot of overlap with XLink, XInclude, XSL, and CSS. I think those technologies together could accomplish everything that's suggested here. If they can't, I'd really like to hear why they can't, and then ask whether it might be simpler to make a few small additions to those specs rather than 
inventing something completely new.

<p>This Saturday I'll be at the first <a href="http://www.weekendwithexperts.com/">Weekend with Experts</a> show in New York to talk about Effective XML. 
In November I'll talk about testing XML 
at both STPCon and STARWest. 
In December, the <a href="http://www.weekendwithexperts.com/">Weekend with Experts</a> arrives in Philadelphia, where I'll talk about Effective XML one more time.
In January, I'll be at the  <a href="http://xdncd.org/">XML Developers Network of the Capital District</a> in
Albany on the 17th to talk about XOM;
and on February 8, I'll be at the 
<a href="http://www.cdjdn.com/">Capital District Java Developers Network</a>, also in Albany,
 to talk about 
Measuring JUnit Code Coverage.
Then in March it's back to Santa Clara for Software Development 2006 West.
If you'd like me to talk to your user group, just send me an e-mail. I do ask that groups outside the New York City area cover my travel expenses, though sometimes we can piggy back a user group talk on top of a conference in the same general vicinity. 
See you there!

The Mozilla Project has posted the second beta of 
 <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/firefox/">Firefox 1.5</a>.
 The automatic update classifies this as Firefox 1.4.1. 
       New features in 1.5 for XML developers 
       include:
       </p>
       
 <ul>
	<li>      CSS @-moz-document selector for matching on site/document URL, useful in user stylesheets</li>

	<li>SVG support is now turned on by default.   </li>
  
	<li>XML Events in JavaScript  </li>

	<li>An extension to support XForms</li>
  
	<li>CSS 2 quotes support</li>

	<li>CSS 2 counters support</li>

	<li>Lots of neat CSS 3 features</li>

	<li>URIs are now always encoded in UTF-8</li>
</ul>

<p>Other new features in 1.5 include:</p>
       
<ul>
	<li>Sanitize "provides an easy way to quickly remove browsing history, cookies, cache, saved form information, and other personal data. The items to be removed can be customized, and the feature can be activated using either a keyboard shortcut or through a menu item."</li>

	<li>When viewing images, tab icons now display thumbnails of the displayed image.</li>

	<li>"Much faster session history navigation. The feature is off by default but can be enabled for testing purposes by setting the browser.sessionhistory.max_viewers preference to a nonzero number."</li>

	<li>FTP users are prompted for a name and password if anonymous access fails.</li>

  
	<li>Report a broken website wizard</li>

	<li>Changes made in the Preferences window now apply immediately</li>

	<li>Searchable download actions manager</li>

	<li>Searchable cookie manager</li>
</ul>

<p>
"This release does not contain any major new features since Beta 1. Improvements to automated update system, Web site rendering and performance, along with several security fixes are included in this release
Beta 1 users that want to help test software update, should wait for the automatic update to be triggered sometime in the next few days. The incremental update from Beta 1 to Beta 2 is 700K bytes."
       I've been using this version since the alpha 2 
       release a few months ago.
       It feels a little slower than 1.0 but otherwise has been 
       quite stable.

The W3C XForms Working Group has published a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/PER-xforms-20051006/">proposed edited recopmmendation of XForms 1.0</a>. The changes are very minor overall.
"There is one correction that affects conformance. Erratum E69a adds instance to the list of attributes for submission. Without this correction, the intended use of instance replacement is typically not achievable in practice. Furthermore, implementations already support this attribute. So this correction was added to align specification with implementations."

The W3C Synchronized Multimedia Working Group has posted the proposed recommendation 
of
the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/PR-SMIL2-20050927/">Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL 2.1)</a>.
SMIL 2.1 has four goals:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Define an XML-based language that allows authors to write interactive
    multimedia presentations. Using SMIL, an author can describe the temporal
    behaviour of a multimedia presentation, associate hyperlinks with media
    objects and describe the layout of the presentation on a screen.</li>
  <li>Allow reusing of SMIL syntax and semantics in other XML-based
    languages, in particular those who need to represent timing and
    synchronization. For example, SMIL components are used for integrating
    timing into XHTML and into SVG.</li>
  <li>Extend the functionalities contained in the SMIL 2.0 into
    new or revised SMIL 2.1 modules.</li>
  <li>Define new SMIL 2.1 Mobile Profiles incorporating features useful
    within the mobile industry.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Differences from the candidate recommendation are claimed to be "clarifications but no major changes."

I've 
posted beta 8
of <a href="http://jaxen.org/releases.html">Jaxen 1.1</a>, an open source 
(modified BSD license) XPath 1.0 engine for Java that is adaptable to many different object models including XOM, JDOM, DOM, and dom4j. 
Jaxen was originally written by James Strachan and Bob McWhirter.
Beta 8 expands the JavaDoc, cleans up and optimizes various parts of the code base,
and addresses a couple of areas where Jaxen wasn't 
correctly implementing the XPath specification.
It also makes it a little easier not to include the 
Jaxen extension functions if you don't want to. 
</p>

<p>
 The only remaining known bugs involve namespace handling
 in the JDOM navigator. 
Don't be fooled by the "beta" designation. 
This release has many fewer bugs and is much more 
conformant to the XPath specification than the official 1.0 release. We'll probably get around to calling it 1.1 final sometime later this year after doing more work on testing,
documentation, performance, and code cleanup. 
However, there's no reason to wait for that. If you're using Jaxen, you should upgrade to this beta.

The  W3C Multimodal Interaction working group has posted the fifth public working draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-emma-20050916/">EMMA: Extensible MultiModal Annotation markup language</a>. According to the abstract, this spec 
"provides details of an XML markup language for containing and annotating the interpretation of user input. Examples of interpretation of user input are a transcription into words of a raw signal, for instance derived from speech, pen or keystroke input, a set of attribute/value pairs describing their meaning, or a set of attribute/value pairs describing a gesture. The interpretation of the user's input is expected to be generated by signal interpretation processes, such as speech and ink recognition, semantic interpreters, and other types of processors for use by components that act on the user's inputs such as interaction managers."

The W3C Quality Assurance Working Group has published a note on
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/NOTE-test-metadata-20050914/">Test Metadata</a>. According to the note,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
To be truly useful, a test suite should consist of more than a simple collection of tests. Additional information is typically required to help users understand how to execute the tests and how to interpret the results. Much of this information should be provided in the test suite documentation but some is more appropriately provided in the form of <em>metadata</em> about the tests themselves. Well-defined metadata can help in:</p>

 
<ul>
	<li>tracking tests during the development and review process</li>
	<li>filtering tests according to a variety of criteria (for example, whether or not they are applicable for a particular profile or optional feature)</li>
	<li>identifying the area of the specification that is tested by the tests</li>
	<li>constructing a test harness to automatically execute the tests</li>
	<li>formatting test results so that they are easily understood</li>

</ul>

<p>Most test suites provided by W3C Working Groups make use of some form of metadata. However, the extent of metadata usage and the forms and syntax in which metadata elements are defined varies widely from Group to Group. This document defines a minimal set of metadata elements that have proved useful in practice and attempts to standardize their names, syntax, and usage. If the use of standard metadata elements is adopted within the W3C it is likely that standardized tools will be developed to facilitate the tasks listed above.</p>

<p>
The W3C XML Core Working Group has released the final recommendation
of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/REC-xml-id-20050909/">xml:id Version 1.0</a>. This spec defines an
<code>xml:id</code> attribute that 
should always be recognized as an ID, regardless of the presence or absence of a DTD or schema. 
There've been no substantive changes in the spec since the propose recommendation a  few moths ago, just editorial cleanups.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, 
this scheme is pretty badly incompatible with canonical XML, which likes to inherit attributes in the XML namespace onto descendant elements, thus moving xml:id's from one element to another. This has downstream effects on XML digital signatures and XML encryption.
Canonical XML should not have 
 assumed that all attributes in the XML namespace would act like <code>xml:lang</code> and <code>xml:space</code>; but it did; and 
 canonical XML is now a four-year old deployed recommendation;
 so now we're stuck with another messy inconsistency between specs. At some point, we're really going to need to go through all of these and sand down these rough edges to produce XML 2.0.
</p>

It will take a while for software to catch up to this. <a href="http://www.xom.nu/unstable.html">XOM 1.1</a> is one of the few libraries that does already recognize 
<code>xml:id</code>. <code>xml:id</code> was the last blocker before final release. Now that the final version of xml:id is out, expect a release candidate of XOM 1.1 in a few days. (There are also a couple of inconsistencies with Xerces-J 2.7.1 I have to work out.)

The Mozilla Project has posted the first beta of 
 <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/firefox/">Firefox 1.5</a>, formerly known as Firefox 1.1.
       New features in 1.5 for XML developers 
       include:
       </p>
       
 <ul>
	<li>      CSS @-moz-document selector for matching on site/document URL, useful in user stylesheets</li>

	<li>SVG support is now turned on by default.   </li>
  
	<li>XML Events in JavaScript  </li>

	<li>An extension to support XForms</li>
  
	<li>CSS 2 quotes support</li>

	<li>CSS 2 counters support</li>

	<li>Lots of neat CSS 3 features</li>

	<li>URIs are now always encoded in UTF-8</li>
</ul>

<p>Other new features in 1.5 include:</p>
       
<ul>
	<li>Sanitize "provides an easy way to quickly remove browsing history, cookies, cache, saved form information, and other personal data. The items to be removed can be customized, and the feature can be activated using either a keyboard shortcut or through a menu item."</li>

	<li>When viewing images, tab icons now display thumbnails of the displayed image.</li>

	<li>"Much faster session history navigation. The feature is off by default but can be enabled for testing purposes by setting the browser.sessionhistory.max_viewers preference to a nonzero number."</li>

	<li>FTP users are prompted for a name and password if anonymous access fails.</li>

  
	<li>Report a broken website wizard</li>

	<li>Changes made in the Preferences window now apply immediately</li>

	<li>Searchable download actions manager</li>

	<li>Searchable cookie manager</li>
</ul>

<p>
 Beta 1 mostly focuses on bug fixes and performance. However, there are a new features since alpha 2 including SVG events
JavaScript  1.6 which includes ECMAScript for XML.
       I've been using alpha 2 for a few months now.
       It feels a little slower than 1.0 but otherwise has been 
       quite stable.

Kudos to Sun for beginning to fight the scourge of license proliferation.
Effective immediately, Sun is retiring the
Sun Industry Standards Source License (SISSL) under which OpenOffice has previously been published. According to Louis Suarez-Potts,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
How does this move affect OpenOffice.org? As most know,  OpenOffice.org code was launched under the dual banner of the SISSL  and LGPL; licensees could choose which one they wanted to use, and  nearly all have chosen the LGPL.  Effective with the announcement  that Sun is retiring the SISSL, however, OpenOffice.org will in the  future only be licensed under the LGPL.
</p>

<p>
For users, the simplification means: no change.  OpenOffice.org  remains free to use, distribute, even sell.  One can freely use it in  commercial as well as government environments; nothing has changed.
</p>

<p>
For vendors, distributors, add-on and plug-in writers of  OpenOffice.org:  The LGPL allows for commercial distribution without  affecting derived products in the same way as the GPL.
</p>

<p>
For developers and other contributors:  As the code will be licensed  only under the LGPL, modifications to the source must be published.   (The SISSL did not require all changes to the source to be  published.)  As most OpenOffice.org contributors are already openly  contributing to the community, we anticipate no problems.  And for  those who have been using the SISSL exclusively, we invite you to  join us.

I've updated the <a href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/tradeshows.xml">conferences page</a>. 
They're only about five relevant conferences I know of over the next year, though I suspect they're at least two more coming next summer that just haven't been officially scheduled yet. 
</p>

<p>
The page is now written completely in XML and styled with XSLT. If you notice any weirdnesses in the page, holler. The <a href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/tradeshows.html">old HTML version</a> is still available; but it's now statically 
generated once a day from the XML version. (It's not like I change the page more often than that, and cron is just easier to set up than Cocoon or something fancier. The RSS feeds have been generated out of cron for a couple of years now, and that seems to work well.)
</p>

<p>
XML is  eight years old now, and I really think it's time to start experimenting with real XML served directly to clients for a change. I'm also hopeful that it will be easier to edit and update the page than it was to maintain the old HTML page.
A lot of the internal links, duplicate content, and old data can be managed automatically by XSLT so I actually have to type quite a bit less to enter a new show. Semantic markup is not just better for machines than presentational markup. Done right, it's also easier for humans to author.

In addition Saxon-SA incorporates some advanced extensions not available in the Saxon-B product. These include a try/catch capability for catching dynamic errors, improved error diagnostics, support for higher-order functions, and additional facilities in XQuery including support for grouping, advanced regular expression analysis, and formatting of dates and numbers." Version 8.5.1 focuses on bug fixes and optimizations.

The Fall conference season is upon us, and I am racing to finish my notes for four different shows that all have their deadlines at the end of this month. The first show is a new one, <a href="http://www.eclipseworld.net/">EclipseWorld</a>, at the Roosevelt Hotel in Manhattan Monday-Wednesday next week. (August 29-31).
The show seems to cover pretty much everything Eclipse related from RCP to SWT to TTPP to WST to ABCDEFG to WXYZ. I'll be delivering four sessions on <em>XML Editing in Eclipse</em>, <em>Macifying SWT</em>, <em>Test Driven Development with Eclipse</em>, and 
<em>Static Code Analysis in Eclipse</em>.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
The next show I'll be at is 
 <a href="http://www.sdexpo.com/">Software Development Best Practices</a> in Boston
(September 26-29). As well as hosting a panel on next generation client side technologies I'll be talking about <em>Effective XML</em>, <em>GUI Testing</em>, <em>JUnit 4</em>, <em>Testing XML</em>, and <em>User Interface Principles in API Design</em>.
The show 
is looking for a few more <a href="http://sdexpo.com/2005/bp/volunteer/index.htm">volunteers</a>
to man doors, distribute notes, and similar tasks. 
For each day you volunteer, you get to attend the conference for a day free; and most volunteer days involve nothing more strenuous than
sitting in the back of the room listening to the presentation,
and collecting eval forms at the end; so really, it's a nice way to attend the show for free.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
Then it's back to New York October 15-16 for the kickoff event in a new <a href="http://www.weekendwithexperts.com/">Weekend with Experts</a> series devoted to J2EE. I'm not much of a J2EE person, but I'll fake it by talking about <em>Effective XML</em>. 
</p>
<hr />
<p>
Staying in New York (I'm really glad to see so many shows coming to New York) November 1-3 will be the Software Test &amp; Performance Conference
at the Roosevelt Hotel. Here I'll talk about <em>Testing XML</em> 
and <em>Measuring JUnit Code Coverage</em>.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
Then I'll be travelling to Los Angeles 
for the first time November 14-18 for <a href="http://www.sqe.com/starwest/">STARWest 2005</a>.
I'll be 
teaching a one-day intro tutorial to JUnit designed for testers, and then talking about <em>Testing XML</em> again. 
</p>
<hr />
<p>
In December, there's a tentative trip planned to Antwerp, Belgium 
for <a href="http://www.javapolis.com/">Javapolis</a>. Details still remain to be worked out but I'll probably be talking about XML related subjects. 
</p>
<hr />
<p>
Moving even further out, next year I'll definitely be at 
<a href="http://www.sdexpo.com/">Software Development 2006 West</a>, March 13-17, 2006, in
Santa Clara once again. I'm on the advisory board for that show 
and we're just starting to pick next year's sessions, but it looks like it's going to be really hot. In particular, it looks like there'll be a lot of AJAX, scripting, and web app content in addition to the usual batch of Java, C++, .NET, XML, and Testing. Plus I'm expecting to host the world's first ever 6:00 A.M. BoF. 
</p>
<hr />
<p>
If there are any other shows you'd like to see me at, just <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;elharo%40metalab%2Eunc%2Eedu?subject=JavaReading">drop me a line</a> 
or ask the show organizers to recruit me. (Believe it or not they really do read the evaluation forms you fill out at the end of every session, and if you ask for particular speakers, they will notice.)  I also talk to user groups  if travel expenses can be covered and they're not too far from New York City, or if they can be scheduled in conjunction with a show I'm already attending. (Contrary to popular belief, publishers do not have unlimited budgets for author tours. In fact, for midlist computer book authors, they tend to have no such budget at all. :-) ) 
I also do occasional corporate training on XML, test driven development, and Java.
</p>

<p>
Laid out like that, it looks like quite a lot. It always seems more doable when I'm signing up for these shows and don't have four simultaneous deadlines staring down my throat. :-) But it's usually a good time, and I hope to meet some of you there.

The W3C Web Services Addressing Working Group has  posted the candidate recommendations of 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/CR-ws-addr-core-20050817">Web Services Addressing 1.0 Core</a> 
and 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/CR-ws-addr-soap-20050817">Web Services Addressing - SOAP Binding</a>.
The core spec 
defines abstract generic extensions to the Infoset for 
endpoint references and message addressing properties.
The binding spec describes 
how the abstract properties defined in the core spec is implemented in SOAP.
These specs are seeing some serious pushback within the W3C.
The problem is that there already is an addressing system for the Web. It's called the URI, and it's not at all clear that web services addressing
does anything beyond URIs do except add complexity.
In fact, it's pretty clear that it doesn't do anything except add complexity.
</p>

<p>
Here's the problem. Web Services Addressing "defines two constructs, message addressing properties and endpoint references, that normalize the information typically provided by transport protocols and messaging systems in a way that is independent of any particular transport or messaging system." In other words this is another example of the excessive genericity problem, just like DOM, and remember how well that worked. One of the big fundamental  problems with DOM was that they tried to develop an architecture that could work for all conceivable programming languages; but developers don't want and don't need an API for all programming languages. they want an API that's tailored to their own programming language. This is why language-specific libraries like XOM and Amara are so much easier to use and more productive than DOM.  
</p>

<p>
Web Services Addressing is trying to define an addressing scheme that can work over HTTP, SMTP, FTP, and any other protocol you can imagine. However, each of these protocols already have their own addressing systems. 
Developers working with these protocols don't want and don't need a different addressing system that's marginally more compatible with some protocol they're not using in exchange for substantially less compatibility with the protocol they are using. Besides nobody's actually doing web services over anything except HTTP anyway. Doesn't it just make more sense to use the well understood, already implemented debugged HTTP architecture for this instead of inventing something new?

As I read more and more blogs on a variety of subjects, (and not just blogs but other sites too) there is one consistent mistake I keep seeing again and again and it's becoming more common: 
lack of e-mail addresses. This is killing so many sites, and 
they don't even know it. If you're running a customer focused site, failure to include your contact e-mail in the usual place is customer-hostile.
Guess what? I don't care about your spam paranoia. That's your problem, not mine.
I certainly don't want to give my business to a company that doesn't even have the competence to set up a spam filter. 
Nor do I care about making sure that mail is properly categorized and routed because I'm forced to select the subject from a popup menu. 
If you want to route the e-mail, then hire a human being to do it on your end. Don't waste my time with that. I'll probably do it wrong anyway.
When I see a site with no e-mail address, I know this is a company that is trying to keep their customers away from them. 
I'll go elsewhere. 
</p>

<p>
The same goes for personal sites. Do you want readers to tell you about your mistakes so you can fix them, or do you want to leave them in public view on your web site for all the world to see? Do you want people to volunteer to help with your open source projects? Do you want people to send you job offers and consulting opportunities? Do you want people to offer you money and gifts? Believe it or not, people do all these things; and the people who do this are a highly self-selected bunch that you want to talk to; but if they can't find your e-mail address in the first 20 seconds or so of looking, it won't happen. On personal sites, your name and email address should be clearly visible on nearly every page you write. On  corporate and organizational sites, some general email address that a person reads and forwards should be there too, but you probably won't lost too many customers if you have a link to a contacts page instead. But that's it. Make it any harder to find your email address and you're pissing away potential customers, partners, contributors, friends, investors, and other people you want to talk to. 
Sure, publishing your e-mail address means you'll get a few more obvious Nigerian scams and  crank mail from Christian gun nuts; but it's about 10,000 times easier to delete these than it is to locate a new customer/partner/investor/friend/contributor/donor/etc.
Removing your e-mail addresses from a web site
is like shooting your dog to get rid of a few fleas.
Now I'll get some angry <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;elharo%40metalab%2Eunc%2Eedu">e-mail</a> from a few PETA nuts; but I can deal with that. :-)

A minor annoyance I keep noticing on otherwise well-designed sites including FreshDirect, SpeakEasy, and Amazon. Why can't anyone forget 
credit cards that have obviously expired? I understand that you may need to store the old data for purposes of verifying old purchases (though this data should probably be purged after six months or some such) but why do you keep asking me to pay with a credit card that expired two years ago? I haven't used that card for months. I've made multiple payments on other cards. Why can't you update the default card? This is just plain stupid.

The W3C SVG and CSS Working Groups have  posted the fourth
public working draft <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-sXBL-20050815/">SVG's XML Binding Language (sXBL)</a>. 
sXBL works like <i>literal result element used as stylesheet</i> 
is XSLT.
That is, an sXBL document
is an SVG document that 
can contain content from other namespaces.
This SVG document 
specifies bindings between elements in those namespaces and particular SVG shapes. When an SVG processor renders
			the complete document, it replaces the content from other namespaces with their SVG bindings. 
This would be more useful if it were also possible to have external sXBL documents (more like traditional stylesheets) 
that don't require the source document and the SVG to be  together in one place. Perhaps this will come in sXBL 2 some time down the road.
Ultimately, this would allow browsers to render XML documents
 that don't look remotely like text, such as MathML and MusicXML.
 If you're curious about this, you might be interested in <a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-sxbl1/">An early look at sXBL</a> I wrote for IBM developerWorks.

The Apache Web Services Project has posted version 0.5 of <a href="http://ws.apache.org/jaxme/">JaxMe 2</a>,
an open source implementation of the Java API for XML Binding.
Quoting from the web page,
</p>


<blockquote>
<p>
        JaxMe 2 is an open source implementation of
        <a href="http://java.sun.com/xml/jaxb/"><span class="codefrag">JAXB</span></a>, the specification for
        Java/XML binding. 
      </p>

      <p>A Java/XML binding compiler takes as input a schema
        description (in most cases an XML schema but it may be a DTD, a
        RelaxNG schema, a Java class inspected via reflection or a database
        schema). The output is a set of Java classes:
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A Java bean class compatible with the schema description. (If the schema was
            obtained via Java reflection, then the original Java bean class.)</li>
          <li>An unmarshaller that converts a conforming XML document into the equivalent Java bean.</li>
          <li>Vice versa, a marshaller that converts the Java bean back into the original XML document.</li>
        </ul>
      <p>

        In the case of JaxMe, the generated classes may also
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Store the Java bean into a database. Preferably an XML database like
            <a href="http://exist.sf.net/"><span class="codefrag">eXist</span></a>,
            <a href="http://xml.apache.org/xindice/"><span class="codefrag">Xindice</span></a>, or
            <a href="http://www.softwareag.com/tamino/"><span class="codefrag">Tamino</span></a>, but it may also
            be a relational database like <a href="http://www.mysql.com/"><span class="codefrag">MySQL</span></a>.
            (If the schema is sufficiently simple. :-)</li>
          <li>Query the database for bean instances.</li>

          <li>Implement an EJB entity or session bean with the same abilities.</li>
        </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
Version 0.5
 maps <code>xs:extension</code> 
to Java inheritance and adds support for mixed content.
<em>Excuse me?</em>
You mean it didn't support mixed content before now? No matter how many times it happens, I remain amazed when I see products advertise support for 
basic, sine qua non parts of XML like mixed content or Unicode as new features in the latest version. There are certain companies I've learned to expect this from (and whose press releases I'm very skeptical of as a result) but normally Apache is better than this. OK, this is still only an 0.5 release; and the last version was 0.4 so it's not really all that bad.
Nonetheless I think if your tool doesn't support XML, (and if you don't support mixed content you don't support XML) you really shouldn't be advertising it until you fix that.

"a simple unit testing library for XSLT written in Java. Juxy allows to call or apply individual XSLT templates from Java and does not use any specific features of XSLT processor for that purposes. It relies entirely on TRaX API and should work with any TRaX compliant XSLT processor."

A batch file is provided that runs the tests with Java. However, any XSLT 2.0 processor should do the trick.
According to Tennison, "You embed tests in the stylesheet
and can run a script (or configure your editing environment) to
extract and run them and create an HTML report on the result."
Saxon 8.4 is required to run the .bat file. (No Unix or Mac support yet, though.)

Day 5 of Extreme begins. This is half day with three sessions and a closing keynote, which is plenty enough. I'm a little zoned by now. First talk this morning is IBM's Erik Hennum discussing "<a href="http://www.mulberrytech.com/Extreme/Proceedings/html/2005/Hennum01/EML2005Hennum01.html">A Unified Type Hierarchy: A Proposal for DITA 2</a>."
DITA is the Darwin Information Typing Architecture. From his diagram it looks like another example of the rule that any problem can be solved by an additional layer of indirection. In this case, the indirection allows different topics (answers to questions) to be combined in different ways in different collections. "Maps are collections of topic references that provide a context for topics...maps aggregate topics." This enables the same content to be reused in many different contexts and collections. caveat: despite the terminology this is not about topic maps. DITA is  a hierarchy of types. Customizing XML markup to your needs prevents you from sharing the work with other groups. Instead of customizing, he wants to specialize. I'm not sure I see the difference, but it seems to be just sharing some markup and adding new custom markup instead of doing everything from scratch. Extension by substitution. This seems to be like subclassing in OOP. They can say that a <code>steps</code> is an <code>ol</code>, and a <code>step</code> is an <code>li</code>, and a <code>taskbody</code> is a <code>body</code> and so forth. They use DTDs, attributes, and XSLT to enable all this. "It's proven to be very pragmatic." "You can only constrain content models. You can't add things to content models." This is like inheritance where you can override but not add new methods. 
(Difference is that the overriding elements/methods don't have the same names as the methods they override.)
XSLT can easily change your specialized content to the more general form, mostly just by changing element names. This is DITA as it exists today.
</p>

<!--
<p>
There are many common specialization on this framework:
</p>

Aliases for element and attribute names
Add attributes (not just rename)
Changing elements to attributes and vice versa
Restricting content models
-->

<p>
What else is needed? Obviously the ability to add properties to
subclasses, as well as just rename them. i.e. subtypes can have child elements the supertype doesn't have.

The first (and last) real case study I've seen at this show is 
Jeff Beck describing
"How XML made the NIH "Policy on Enhancing Public Access to Archived Publications Resulting from NIH-Funded Research." The extreme part is the public access policy. (Not so extreme: it's voluntary.) The XML part is <a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/">PubMed Central</a>, a stable archive of NIH funded research publications.
 (This is not the same as <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi">PubMed</a>, which only contains abstracts, though about 13 million of them. This contains full articles.)
About 1400  NIH funded papers <em>a week</em> are published.
Every submitted article is converted into XML (often from PDF!?) 
(Many are submitted in SGML.)
These papers need to be accessible without plugins and on slow connections (e.g. in the field in Africa). Special characters and math were thus a problem.
Unicode is part of the answer but only part.
They are scanning back issues. Only 11 manuscripts are available so far. More are coming. Articles are delayed six months after original paper publication before being posted online. They validate with DTDs and XSLT.

Good morning. Welcome to day 3 of Extreme. If you're only reading this in RSS, or in one of those browsers/aggregators that can't handle the full panoply of correct RSS &lt;Cough&gt;Planet XMLHack&lt;/Cough>, 
&lt;Cough&gt;Artima&lt;/Cough>, you're missing a lot. Come visit the site. And to answer one frequently asked question I'll do a full text feed for this site at such time as someone writes an RSS client that gives a 
user experience at least equal to  a real Web browser. That means at a minimum:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>It must be open source.</li>

	<li>It must run on Mac OS X.</li>

	<li>It must fully aggregate feeds.</li>

	<li>It must hide previously read items.</li>

	<li>It must fully support Atom 1.0 and XHTML.</li>

	<li>It must not clutter the screen with irrelevant detritus.</li>

	<li>The page up, page down, home, and end keys must all work correctly.</li>

	<li>It must import and export  OPML.</li>
	<li>It must be at least as AppleScriptable as FireFox (which honestly isn't all that much).</li>
	<li>It must not allow any third party to observe what I'm reading.</li>
</ul>


<p>
That's not everything, but those are some of the most common problems
I've encountered; and I've tried pretty much everything that's out there.
If a product satisfies criterion 1 (open source) and is written in a language and on top of a toolkit I'm comfortable with and gets pretty close to these requirements, I'd even dedicate some time to filling in the last holes.  Sage is probably the closest I've come to what I want, but it's not quite there yet; and I really don't have any experience hacking on XUL.
I did submit one patch to fix its font size problems, but the remaining missing features exceed my ability to fix in the time I have available.
</p>

<p>
I don't have any particular reason to prefer HTML to Atom/RSS for this site. There aren't any ads, and I rarely bother to look at my traffic stats;
but I'm not going to put any effort into creating full-content feeds until there's a browser that can handle it.

<p>
This morning starts with two sessions on overlap, a perennial favorite topic here at Extreme. In fact, a brief comment I made here on <a href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/oldnews/news2005August2.html">Tuesday</a> 
while listening to the keynotes 
elicited a <a href="http://extreme.xmlhack.com/Overlap">rather lengthy explanation</a> from one of the conference co-chairs on the conference Wiki.
</p>

<p>
This is the topic that justifies calling this conference Extreme <em>Markup</em> instead of Extreme <em>XML</em>.
The overlap problem arises when things don't fit neatly into trees. For instance, suppose a quotation spans several paragraphs but begins and ends in the middle of two different paragraphs. How do you handle that? There are a number of approaches, none of them really satisfying. 
I wrote a little  about this in <cite><a href="books/effectivexml/">Effective XML</a></cite>, but everything suggested there was really just a hack. One common approach is to use 
empty-element tags as pseudo-start and end-tags connected by attributes
as in this example adapted from Syd Bauman's talk this morning:
</p>

<pre><code><![CDATA[<line>And I said to him, <quote startID="q2"/>Superman, have you not seen,</line>
<line>The embarrassment havoc I'm wreaking?<quote endID="q2"/></line>]]></code></pre>

<p>
The bottom line is that overlap is just not something XML is designed to support. Really handling overlap requires a different markup language. One popular choice is Wendell Piez and Jeni Tennison's <a href="http://www.lmnl.net/">LMNL</a> (pronounced "liminal") which stands for
"Layered Markup and Annotation Language." Jeni isn't here this year, but Paul Caton is and will be talking about LMNL in the second session this morning. 
</p>

<p>
Overlap tends to arise more
in analysis of text rather than authoring of text.
Overlap is a particular problem for scholars doing textual analysis of  the Bible. Shakespeare, etc. 
I suspect Syd Bauman will be addressing this in the first session this morning,
"<a href="http://www.mulberrytech.com/Extreme/Proceedings/html/2005/Bauman01/EML2005Bauman01.html">TEI HORSEing around: Handling overlap using the Trojan Horse method</a>."
Overlap does not seem to be such 
a big deal for original authors of new work since it's normally possible to fit most content into reasonable trees without a great deal of effort, as long as you think about it up front.
And even if you don't it still doesn't tend to come up that often. The author has one view of the document that does fit pretty well into a tree most of the time.
For textual analysis, however, different scholars are going to want to ask different questions and thus form different trees from the same text.
(As Walter Perry noted yesterday, the intent of the author is not necessarily and should not necessarily be respected by the reader.)
For instance,
one use case might require marking up text 
by speaker and another by verse.
Do we need to have both trees in the same document, 
or is the real solution a way of combining and applying different trees over the same text?
</p>

<p>
However, there's one other use case for overlapping markup; and this is a real practical killer application, even for those of us who don't analyze classical Greek and Hebrew corpora for a living. That use case is change control and revision markers. The current state of the art for change control is CVS and Subversion, which just treat XML like any other text files. I'm not sure what the state of the art is for XML change markers; probably whatever's in OpenOffice.org's format or Microsoft's WordprocessingML. I'll have to take a look at that and see how they handle it. But whatever they do, I bet it's a kludge. I don't think there's a good solution for this problem within the bounds of standard XML.
</p>
<hr />

<p>
Why does an ID have to identify a single element? For instance if a quote is spread out over several paragraphs, why can't we assign the same ID to each of the paragraphs or other elements used in the quote, and thus have an ID for the whole distributed quote? 
</p>
<hr />

the matching between the pseudo-start empty element-tags and the corresponding pseudo-end empty-element tag because RELAX NG can't do this.
(This would make a compelling use case for extensible RELAX NG complex types validation. Someone remind me to send this to the relaxng mailing list.) He might like to extend this scheme to many elements.
</p>

<p>
It strikes me that the real problem with the TEI approach is that it's not naturally exposed in the tools and data models used by DOM, XPath, XQuery, XSLT, etc. He recognizes this too. The pseudo-start-tags and pseudo-end-tags don't become real elements when parsed. He can swap 
which elements overlap which. However, this may break validity.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
The second session features 
Paul Caton  talking about  "LMNL Matters?" LMNL has not seen broad adoption or development.
</p>
<img src="images/caton.jpg" alt="Paul Caton talking about LMNL" width="551" height="446" />
<p>
He wants genuine third party markup like highlighting a book.
That is, the author does not know about, permit, or
participate in the markup. Hence Limner.
</p>

<p>
He references Foucault as saying users tend to think in hierarchies naturally, at least post-Linnaeus.
</p>

<p>
In Q&amp;A Wendell Piez suggests that multiple overlapping hierarchies are a subset of the overlap problem. 
</p>
<hr />
<p>
After the coffee break, Erich Schubert
discusses
"<a href="http://www.mulberrytech.com/Extreme/Proceedings/html/2005/Schaffert01/EML2005Schaffert01.html">Structure-preserving difference search for XML documents</a>" (co-authors Sebastian Schaffert and François Bry). Think diff, merge, patch, CVS, Subversion, etc. but also 
about humans scanning diff files to identify changes. This is where diff really falls down. Plus line-based text diffing isn't really suitable for XML. Most XML differencing uses longest common subsequence where XML tokens such a stags are used as the boundaries rather than line breaks. This algorithm focuses on producing the minimal file size, but honestly who cares about this in 2005? It was important for distributing software over Usenet in 1985, but it's just not a problem today. It's more important to focus on human factors and human comprehensibility of the diff files.
He shows Logilab's XPath based 
xmldiff format; and he's right. It's ugly and incomprehensible. 
</p>
<img src="images/Schubert.jpg" alt="Eric Schubert on Differencing" width="364" height="493" />
<p>
Xcerpt query by example and Simulation Unification 
algorithm inspired him. He's trying to maximize structure preservation in the diffs. They use Dijkstra's algorithm with optimized cost functions
<a href="http://ssddiff.alioth.debian.org">Implementation</a> is open source in C++ on top of libxml. The prototype is limited to XML, but the algorithms generalize to any graphs. The output format is XUpdate
</p>
<hr />
<p>
We need a lightning talk session at this conference.
</p>
<hr /> 
<p>
 Steven DeRose gives the talk I'm most looking forward to hearing this morning,
"<a href="http://www.mulberrytech.com/Extreme/Proceedings/html/2005/DeRose01/EML2005DeRose01.html">Architecture and speed of common XML operations</a>." Optimization's always fun, if usually unnecessary; and this might give me some good ideas for speeding up XOM. (The next beta should be roughly twice as fast as the previous release, by the way. Wolfgang Hoschek found a number of inefficiencies in parsing and serialization I've now corrected.)
</p>
<img src="images/derose.jpg" alt="Steve DeRose talks about speed" width="453" height="360" />
<p>
He starts off with a recap of basic algorithm analysis. Steve, we all know all this already. Tell us about XML! (There are ~60! particles in the universe. I didn't know that, and I sort of wanted to. Does that include photons and neutrinos or just protons, neutrons, and electrons?)
</p>

<p>
OK, he's finally started on XML 20 minutes into a 45 minute talk.
Or really SGML. A naive implementation of
the &amp; operator can have exponential behavior
(but better algorithms are possible.) So far this is still old news 
and a solved problem though. 
</p>

<p>
Onto XPath: what's the speed of different query operations? Same question for DOM. These are non-trivial. XPath tends to be at least O(n) where n is the number of items in the list you're operating on. DOM does not offer preceding or following axis like XPath does. This means XPath on top of DOM has a bottleneck on the preceding and following axes. (Perhaps for this reason nobody actually does this.) If you have a list of all the nodes in the document (which DOM normally doesn't), then preceding and following are fast.
</p>


<p>
Parameters (the N in O(N) ) can be the number of nodes in the document, the depth of the tree, or the number of children. In his experiments non-CALS documents tended to be about 8 deep. CALS documents were about 13 deep. Number of children runs about 1-100. Dictionaries that out all the definitions at one level may go up to 25,000 child elements or even 125,000 for an English danish dictionary one audience member worked on; but normally number of children is 100 or less. 
</p>


<p>
Storage models: 
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Raw XML</li>
	<li>Native XML database (that encompasses a lot of options)</li>
	<li>Relational XML</li>
	<li>Why is he ignoring object model issues? That's an important fourth option, though there are as many or more options as in case 2. </li>
</ul>

<p>
Indexing helps for raw XML, but it imposes size limits on the documents you can handle.
</p>

<p>
Big problem with relational databases for XML is limited axis support. Plus they explode space usage. First child + next sibling is a common compromise. However it's one way. Parent and first-child also works OK. 
It's O(N) to get the preceding siblings. All preceding siblings is O(N<sup>2</sup>). All preceding siblings of all nodes is O(N<sup>3</sup>) on this implementation. Or you can work around it in your code. Instead gather a list of all the siblings in forward order and then run through it backwards. In other words, flipping the order of iteration through the loop may speed code up by three orders of magnitude or more. Collecting all the ancestors is also expensive on top of a relational database. (fixed point join) Dongwook Shin has a method to pack an XML structure into a relational database. This is pretty clever stuff that I can't type fast enough to summarize. Read the paper. However the insertions are expensive but you can use real numbers instead of integers to speed up insertions.
And he's out of time.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
Sometimes the most interesting things happen at lunch. David Dubin just <a href="http://leep.lis.uiuc.edu/publish/dubin/papers/dubin04trends.pdf">clued me in</a> to the non-existence of the <em>phantom paper</em>,
an influential paper that is regularly cited in its field that was never written and never published. I've heard of urban myths and famous quotes that were never actually said; but this is the first time  I've encountered a mythical paper. This paper is usually cited as having been written 30 years ago, so why are we just now discovering that it doesn't exist?
Doesn't anyone check their references any more? 
</p>

<hr />
<p>
Mirco Hilbert and Andreas Witt
(co-author  Oliver Schoenfeld) are discussing 
"<a href="http://www.mulberrytech.com/Extreme/Proceedings/html/2005/Witt01/EML2005Witt01.xml">Making CONCUR Work</a>". As Deborah LaPeyre said in her introduction, CONCUR is the feature in SGML nobody ever implemented. 
</p>
<img src="images/hilbert.jpg" alt="Mirco Hilbert and Andreas Witt" width="452" height="451" />
<p>
The issue is non-hierarchies: multiple roots. Non-hierarchical markup (e.g. overlap) can often be implemented as multiple trees. CONCUR allowed on document to reference two different DTDs for two different, potentially overlapping hierarchies. They call their solution MuLaX (Multi-Layered XML). It's modeled on CONCUR but is not CONCUR. It looks like this:
</p>

<pre><code><![CDATA[<?mlx version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?>
<!DOCTYPE (1)div SYSTEM "tei/dtd/teispok2.dtd">
<!DOCTYPE (2)text SYSTEM "tei/dtd/teiana2.dtd">
<(1)div type="dialog" org="uniform">
  <(2)text>
    <(1)u who="Peter">
      <(2)s>Hey Paul!</(2)s>
      <(2)s>Would you give me
    </(1)u>
    <(1)u who="Paul">
      the hammer?</(2)s>
    </(1)u>
  </(2)text>
</(1)div>]]></code></pre>

<p>
They can project this onto an annotation layer that I think is real XML. 
The editor tool is written in C++ with wxWidgets.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
The next session is "A New Paradigm of Parsing XML 
based on Free Cursor Mobility" (FCM) by Antonio J. Sierra.
This is event based parsing (like SAX or StAX?). The difference is you can move the cursor back as well as forward. 
It's designed for small platforms (e.g. cell phones and PDAs). 
Could you implement XPath on top of this? Maybe even if not perfectly efficiently? Might be important for small devices with large documents.
</p>

<p>
The API terminology is a little idiosyncratic, brother and father instead of sibling and parent. 
</p>

<p>
The idea is pretty obvious: basically it's an iterator like in a pull parser with extra methods to go backwards as well as forwards. The key is in the implementation. How will this work on streaming data over the network? It measures faster than Xparser-J (DOM) but slower than kxml2. 
kxml2 is the only parser in his comparison list I've heard of, and it's not state of the art. 
</p>
<hr />
<p>
Felix Sasaki (co-authors Christian Lieske and Andreas Witt) is talking about the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-itsreq-20050805">W3C's Internationalization and Localization Markup Requirements</a> (which is scheduled to be published tomorrow but he gave away the URL today).
More specifically he's talking about "Schema Languages &amp; Internationalization Issues: A survey."
</p>
<img src="images/sasaki.jpg" alt="Felix Sasaki talks about internationalization and localization" width="460" height="444" />
<p>
The question is how to work internationalization and localization based markup such as bidirectional markers and Ruby into schemas.
Versioning is a problem. XHTML is the poster child here.
DTD modularization doesn't survive validation.
W3C Schemas have problems. Architectural forms may help as may RDF.
Eric van der Vlist in Q&amp;A
suggests using processing instructions instead. 
</p>
<hr />
<p>
In the final regular session of the day Liam Quin is catching flak for the W3C about anything and everything people want to bitch about. 
He hopes XSLT 2 will go to candidate recommendation in a couple of months. 
</p>
<img src="images/liam.jpg" alt="Liam Quin at Extreme 2005" width="322" height="616" />

<p>
Tommie Usdin is very disappointed in the "nearly all" compatibility of XSLT 2 with XSL 1.1. She wants full compatibility. "It erodes confidence. It's an enormously big public relations mistake."
</p>

<p>
Syd Bauman wants the W3C to handle characters  outside of Unicode
(a very bad idea IMHO). He wants SDATA entities.
</p>

<p>
Simon St. Laurent wants to 
start simplifying standards again (as XML simplified SGML, XSL simplified DSSSL, and XLink simplified HyTime) and stop building huge specs by committee like Schemas, XQuery, and XSLT 2. Ann Wrightson agrees, and adds that she wants the W3C to knock vendor heads together to encourage more schema compatibility.
</p>

<p>
John  Cowan wants the XML Core Working Group shut down to prevent people from tampering with the core of XML. 
</p>
<p>
Scott from Boeing found
that most of their suppliers didn't even know what XML was, and they had to train them. They also had problems with XML editors that couldn't handle some basic tests cases. 
</p>

<dt id="news2005August3">Wednesday, August 3, 2005 (<a href="oldnews/news2005August3.html">Permalink</a>)</dt><dd>

<p>
Day two of Extreme commences.  
<a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/7483">Simon St. Laurent</a> and <a href="http://www.mulberrytech.com/Extreme/SperbergArticle1.html">Roger Sperberg</a> are also reporting from the show, and both paid more attention yesterday 
to what people were actually saying than I was. I confess yesterday's sessions on
OWL, RDF, Topic Maps, and UBL
pretty much put me to sleep. Plus, these days I'm a morning person. I'm ready to go by 6:00 A.M. and anything after lunch is a stretch. 
(Welcome to middle age.)
It also didn't help that two of the talks I particularly wanted to hear yesterday were cancelled. At least the DFDL replacement session was interesting. I was a little too tired to get full value out of it, 
but it does sound worth exploring more in the future.
However, there are lots of good talks to look forward to today starting with two on XSLT and a talk from Walter Perry,
one of the most iconoclastic thinkers in the XML space.
He's so diametrically opposed to the conventional wisdom that most people can't even hear what he's saying.  It's like trying to explain atheism to an eighth grade class in a Texas Christian school. Atheist: "I don't believe in God." Class: "You worship Satan?!" Atheist: "No, I don't believe in any gods." Class: "But that means you believe in the devil."  Atheist: "No, I don't believe in the devil either." Class: "But you just said you don't believe in God." Except in Walter's case it's schemas, DTDs, and preexisting agreements he doesn't believe in instead of God and the Devil.
(Disclaimer: This is just a metaphor.
I have no idea what Walter's religious beliefs are.)
</p>
<hr />
<p>
Ken Holman is talking about 
<a href="http://www.mulberrytech.com/Extreme/Proceedings/html/2005/Holman01/EML2005Holman01.html">synthesizing XSLT</a> based on his experience with the UBL stylesheets.
25 stylesheets is too many to write by hand.
Instead he annotates a literal result (a hand-authored instance of <acronym title="XSL Formatting Objects">XSL-FO</acronym>)
and generates the XSLT from that. This was important because in UBL he needs to match the printed formatting very precisely. He annotates with namespaced attributes that an <acronym title="XSL Formatting Objects">XSL-FO</acronym> processor will ignore. RELAX NG helped him because it could validate only the annotations and ignore everything else. This seems like a very powerful idea.  I don't fully understand his syntax yet, but it doesn't look too complex. 
</p>
<hr />
<p>
I think I've figured out what was wrong with the camera. The autofocus only works indoors if the flash is turned on. Here's a picture of Ken presenting:

<p>
If only I'd remembered to install iPhoto or Photoshop Elements 
on the PowerBook before leaving New York. 
</p>
<hr />
<p>
 Matthijs Breebaartis from Holland is 
 talking about "<a href="http://www.mulberrytech.com/Extreme/Proceedings/html/2005/Breebaart01/EML2005Breebaart01.html">Processing references to documents you don’t have access to: Constructing identifiers with Relax NG and XSLT</a>". 
The problem is a lot of information is organized into "vendor silos" and they want to be able to break the silos, and show the users what they need 
from across many different silos without redundancy. They need to link all this stuff but they don't control it. Different publishers have different URLs for the same things. (So much for the "Uniform" part.)
They tried to get everyone in one room and agree on basic concepts.
He prefers meaningful identifiers to opaque IDs. They wrote everything in RELAX NG and used Trang to translate to W3C XML Schemas to satisfy company policies. Their element names are all in Dutch, but appear to be restricted to ASCII. They use Python.
</p>

<hr />
<p>
Why don't the raw XML forms of the papers published on the Extreme web site
have xml-stylesheet processing instructions? e.g. <a href="http://www.mulberrytech.com/Extreme/Proceedings/xml/2005/Wrightson01/EML2005Wrightson01.xml">this one</a>.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
Ann Wrightson is talking about
"<a href="http://www.mulberrytech.com/Extreme/Proceedings/html/2005/Wrightson01/EML2005Wrightson01.html">Semantics of well-formed XML as a human and machine readable language</a>." 
</p>

<img src="images/wrightson.jpg" alt="Ann M Wrightson talking at Extreme Markup Languages 2005" width="606" height="556" />
<hr />
<p>
The official title of Walter Perry's talk is
"Indexing The Whole As Well As The Parts: Derived Schemas and Imputed Hierarchies in Document Management." He starts with a <a href="http://lists.xml.org/archives/xml-dev/199808/msg00344.html">quote from Peter Murray-Rust</a> about how the CML DTD must be flexible because we don't understand chemistry: </p>
<blockquote src="http://lists.xml.org/archives/xml-dev/199808/msg00344.html">
With CML (unlikely though it may seem) we have to have an extremely fluid
DTD. That is because we don't understand chemistry. It was put well by
Democritos "Nothing exists except atoms and empty space - all else is
opinion". The Chemical Bond is simply an opinion and people fight about it
just as much as over XML matters. So CML is increasingly becoming very
sparse (atoms, bond and electrons, with a bit of geometry). That allows
authors free expression. 
</blockquote>
<p>
Walter thinks we don't really understand documents, schematization, or much else; and hence need more flexibility.
Schemata are effectively structural. they are interdocument in scope. They constrain lexical possibility. By contrast instance documents
are hyperstructural. Schemas operate on the internal context of a document.
external context includes hyperlinks, key/value indexing, processes that can consume a document, and processes that might produce a document. External contexts are significant for document search and query.
</p>

<p>
<strong>It is the process that should decide what kind of documents it can consume;
not the document that decides what it can be consumed by; i.e. the document cannot specify its own type. </strong>
</p>

<p>
Indexing documents in semantic value spaces identifies bonds. 
</p>
<img src="images/perry.jpg" alt="Walter Perry at Extreme Markup Languages 2005" width="605" height="419" />

<hr />
<p>
The afternoon sessions begin with 
several talks about XQuery.
The first is Daniela Florescu from Oracle with 
"Declarative XML processing with XQuery: reevaluating the big picture."
She thinks we need more architectural work and 
less syntax sniping.  She thinks we don't have a clear idea of the "final goal" of XML, and that we need one.
"There is one problem: everybody likes it for different reasons."
I disagree on that last point. The beauty of XML is that it solves so many goals so well, including goals no one has thought of. 
We don't all need to do the same thing.
</p>

<p>
She's got some interesting things to say; but she's going way too fast for me to get it all down. Her database colleagues don't believe in mixed content. (No surprises there.) Entity relationships (E/R) don't work with mixed content.
"XML is the <em>only</em> tractable abstract information model that is not E/R based." She brings up LISP. "30-year malaise in IT infrastructure" as a result of schema dependence. XML is the first to allow instance documents to be created in advance of schema. Schemas differ from community to community.
Agreeing on a schema is the most expensive step. 
</p>
<img src="images/daniela.jpg" alt="Daniela Florescu talks about XQuery at Extreme" width="416" height="589" />
<p>
The power of <code>//*</code>; i.e. the ability to query something without knowing where it is or what it's called. (cf. SQL). "XQuery is a not a query language. In my opinion it was a very bad name." Difference between XQuery and SQL is that SQL works on a a table and XQuery on a tree. (Good point, nicely stated.)
</p>

<p>
XML/XQuery doesn't fit anywhere into the current  architecture 
without paying a large price. Architecture needs to change or XML will fail. XQuery data model must be a first class citizen. Must make XML a graph not a tree. (I'm just taking notes here. I disagree with quite a lot though not all of this.) She wants to deprecate document nodes.
</p>

<p>
An E/R model is cyclic. No  standard way to support this in XML. Only hack solutions.
No global and standard solutions. We need <em>native references</em> in XML. This would improve integration between XML and RDF. (In Q&amp;A it comes out that we have them in XML. That's what ID and IDREFS are. It's XQuery that's lacking here.)
</p>

<p>
She wants to deprecate xsi:nil. She wants to embed code behavior into schemas! She wants assertions (preconditions and postconditions) in schemas. 
</p>

<p>
She wants continuous queries over infinite sequences in XQuery. (That might be useful.)
</p>

<p>
"XSLT is easier when the shape of the data is unknown. XQuery is easier when the shape of the data is known." (Another good point, nicely put.)
Web services and XQuery don't work together closely enough.
We need to make XQuery a full programming language. It's Turing complete, but inconvenient for programmers. Writing the code in Java kills the advantages of XML. She wants updates, variable assignment, error handling, and deterministic evaluation order added to XQuery.
</p>

<p>
"The industry needs to outgrow the '<em>XML is a syntax</em>' myth."
She's making so many points and claims so fast that
she has little to no time
to justify any of them. There's probably a day's worth of material she's trying to cram into 45 minutes. 
I see virtually no chance of her getting all (or even any) of the changes she wants, and that's probably a good thing.
</p>


<hr />
<p>
Next Jonathan Robie
(cowritten with Daniela Florescu)
describe "XQuery Update Facility: Setting Up the Problem"
He's talking about one subbullet of one bullet on one of Daniela's slides in the last talk. "We're still not certain what we need."
They aren't even sure about the use cases, much less implementations and strategies. XQuery updates are "mostly ACID." Isolation is the part that makes it only mostly. 
</p>


<hr />
<p>
IBM's Achille Fokoue is talking about 
"Extracting input/output dependencies from XSLT 2.0 and XQuery 1.0."
This involves mappings between schemas (input and output formats)
 as defined by XSLT and XQuery. 
</p>
<img src="images/Fokoue.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="700" />
<p>
The accuracy of the mappings is a trade-off with the cost of creating the mappings. It can have exponential behavior if you aren't careful. XSLT is too tricky to handle due to recursion. XQuery is easier.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
The final talk of the day is C. Michael Sperberg-McQueen on 
"<a href="http://www.mulberrytech.com/Extreme/Proceedings/html/2005/SperbergMcQueen01/EML2005SperbergMcQueen01.html">Applications of Brzozowski derivatives to XML Schema processing</a>." First a brief lesson in Polish on how to pronounce "Brzozowski."
</p>
<img src="images/mcqueen.jpg" alt="C. Michael Sperberg-McQueen" width="528" height="468" />
<p>
A Brzozowski derivative is:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p> the derivative of <i>R</i> with respect to <i>s</i> is the set of strings
            <i>t</i> which can follow <i>s</i> in sentences of <i>R</i>, or: the set of strings <i>t</i> 
            such that the concatenation of <i>s</i> and <i>t</i> is a sentence in <i>R</i>.
            
         </p>

         <p>
            Regular sets of strings can, of course, be denoted by regular
            expressions, and Brzozowski's contribution was to show how, given (1)
            a regular expression <i>E</i> denoting the language <i>R</i> and (2) a string <i>s</i>, to
            calculate a regular expression <i>D</i> denoting the derivative of <i>R</i> with
            respect to <i>s</i>.  He also proved (3) that of all the derivatives
            of an expression, only a finite number would be distinct from each
            other in terms of recognizing different languages, and (4) that
            even if equal expressions are not always detected, there will
            still be only a finite number of dissimilar derivatives, if certain
            simple tests of similarity are performed; he then showed (5) how
            to construct a finite-state automaton from the set of characteristic
            derivatives thus identified.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This talk isn't quite as fast paced as Florescu's, but it
too could really use three hours and a blackboard instead of 45 minutes and slides. It's quite mathematical. The notation he's using is unfamiliar to me. He explains it, but following this is going to be tough. 
</p>
<p>
Brzozowski derivatives allow you to avoid building 
the finite state automaton when evaluating regular expressions.
They can also handle non-deterministic regular expressions very simply.
This has important implications for validation. Evaluation of a regular expression reduces to the question of whether its derivative?
is nullable.
</p>

<p>
Empty sequences and empty choices (sets) are legal in 
the W3C XML schema language. But many think restrictions on xsd:all groups are too onerous. (I agree.)

<p>
I'm at the Extreme Markup Languages conference in Montreal this week.
As the mood strikes me, I may update this site in real time.
However, it will be a little slow going at first as I'm giving one of the <a href="slides/extreme/randomizer/">first talks this morning</a>, and I just found a bug in the software I'm announcing demoing here, and have just over two hours in which to fix it.
Plus I realize I left the most recent version of my notes sitting on my desktop at home, and have to recreate the recent changes.
:-) My camera is acting up. Unless I can figure out how to fix it,
I may not be posting any photos from this year's show. 
</p>
<hr />
<p>
Is overlap really a question of multiple trees and diffs between them?
</p>
<hr />
<p>
My talk is over now.
There were a lot of good suggestions in the talk, and I may be busy for a while trying to implement some of the ideas. What I talked about was a <a href="Randomizer/">small program</a> that obscures XML by randomizing its content and optionally its name while preserving its structure. This enables 
documents to be submitted to tool maintainers to reproduce bugs without
exposing private information. It's currently in very rough shape, just raw source, not even a zip file. I need to improve that now that
it's been officially announced. In the meantime, if you're curious 
probably the best way to get started is by reading the <a href="http://www.mulberrytech.com/Extreme/Proceedings/html/2005/Harold01/EML2005Harold01.html">conference paper</a>. It's nice being the
first talk at the conference.  Now I can give my full concentration
to listening to other people, without being constantly distracted by thinking about what I'm going to say. (Last year I basically ignored a 
talk I really should have heard on GXParse because it happened to fall right before my own XOM talk.)
</p>
<hr />
<p>
You know the saying "It steam engines when it's steam engine time"?
Sometimes at these conferences
you can hear the whistle of the oncoming steam engine a little early.
Of course,  sometimes the steam engine derails on the way (Schemas); and sometimes it always seems to be right around the corner (XQuery, RDF, Topic Maps, Semantic Web). 
But sometimes it really does arrive on schedule (XML, UML, Java, HTML, HTTP, REST, RELAX NG).
I think I'm picking up the sound of the next train. I've heard it in at least three different places just today, and I don't think these people are working together yet; but they're all heading toward the same station.
</p>

<p>
Right now I'm  listening to Kristoffer H. Rose  talk about 
 the <a href="http://forge.gridforum.org/projects/dfdl-wg/">Data Format Description Language
DFDL</a> (pronounced "Daffodil"). This is a way of mapping from standard binary formats like JPEG, COBOL copybooks,
and C code into XML. What jumps out at me about this is he specifically does not want to convert this to an XML document.
He just wants to expose the data through an XML interface. And I'm hearing something similar on a lot of fronts right now, including some of my own work in XOM. 
</p>

<p>
The point is that the sheer cost of converting all the data to Strings (and other objects) is starting to limit parser performance. To some extent, this is nothing new. SAX quite deliberately does not pass 
<code>String</code> to the <code>characters()</code> method. Instead it passes a <code>char[]</code> array and an index into that array. This allows the parser to keep passing the same array to the method and simply update the index. However, SAX, StAX, and similar APIs still create a lot of strings: for each element and attribute name for example. Tree-models like DOM and XOM 
are even more profligate with object creation.
Good parsers like Xerces reuse the same strings; but if you've ever profiled deeply into an XML application you're likely to see a lot of time spent in String creation regardless. What's really annoying about this is that most of the time you don't need most of those strings. A typical application only uses a small subset of the strings (and other objects) an XML parser creates. The I/O cost of moving all this data around can also be significant. 
</p>

<p>
A lot of developers here seem to be converging on the same solution from different directions. The destination is what one of the posters downstairs calls "in situ parsing". In other words, rather than creating objects representing the content of an XML document, just pass pointers into the actual, real XML.  In some cases you wouldn't even need to hold the document in memory. It could remain on disk. This won't work with traditional APIs like SAX and DOM. However, it might be important enough to justify a new API.  Many, though not all, use cases could see an order of magnitude speed-up or better from such an approach. Memory usage could improve too. Current tree models typically require at least 3 times the size of the actual document, more often more. Using a model based on indexes into one big array might allow these to reduce their requirements to twice the size of the original document or even less. Finally, this approach would make retrieving the actual original text of the document feasible, so you could finally tell whether a document used <code>&amp;amp;</code> or <code>&amp;#x0026;</code>. Most programs don't need this ability, but it would be very useful for XML editors and other programs that want to do better round-tripping.

Jon Bosak is doing a last minute fill-in presentation on UBL. 
Basically this is a plan to convert a lot of paper 
documents to XML forms by defining a "royalty-free library of standard business documents." I don't buy it. Bosak says, "You trade off all the wonderful ways you were customizing things, and you do without it."
Customizations are not a mistake. They are necessary functions of doing business. I don't believe in making all businesses work alike just to standardize a few forms and take more humans out of the loop. 
(plus it's not RESTful, but Bosak thinks that's fixable.)

This morning I was reminded yet again of why XML is a vastly superior format to plain text. I wasted at least an hour trying to troubleshoot a problem that in the end came down to this.  My cvspserver file was
</p>

<pre>service cvspserver {
        disable = no
        socket_type     = stream
        wait            = no
        user            = root
        server          = /sw/bin/cvs
        server_args     = -f --allow-root=/usr/local/CVS pserver
        groups          = yes
        flags           = REUSE
}</pre>

<p>
It should have been:
</p>

<pre>
service cvspserver
{
        disable = no
        socket_type     = stream
        wait            = no
        user            = root
        server          = /sw/bin/cvs
        server_args     = -f --allow-root=/usr/local/CVS pserver
        groups          = yes
        flags           = REUSE
}</pre>

<p>
If the difference eludes you, well it eluded me too. This never would have been an issue in XML. The problem is that config files are not plain text.
They have embedded markup. 
It's just that the markup is composed of line breaks, tabs, spaces, and other invisible characters you can't even see. Furthermore, every different tool uses a slightly different markup format, and more often than not that format isn't even documented. The real contest is not between XML and plain text. If it were the first file would have worked. 
The contest is between reliable, robust, explicit, well-understood, well-documented XML formats and fragile, idiosyncratic, implicit, undocumented formats. When you realize that's the choice, there really is no choice. 
In 2005 no new config format should be anything other than XML.

Nokia and Sun have submitted 
<a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=279"><abbr title="Java Specification Request">JSR</abbr>-279: Service Connection API for Java ME</a> to the Java Community Process (JCP). According to the JSR:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>
This JSR proposes a general-purpose high-level Service Connection API for JavaTM ME for mobile devices. The API is intended to support writing mobile clients for identity-based Web services, service-oriented architectures (SOA), and other similar network service application models involving service discovery, authentication and identity. Existing Web services APIs tend to focus on support for low-level protocols, such as SOAP and Web Services Security. However, high-value Web services for mobile devices may be quite complex, requiring identity- based discovery and authentication, multiple service providers, and invocation of device-hosted services. These may require extensive protocol exchanges, complex state machines and other logic. To provide portability and interoperability such applications need to be based on frameworks that specify how multiple protocols and services can work together in a standard way. An example of such a standard framework that is currently being deployed is the Liberty Identity Based Web Services Framework (IDWSF), specified by the Liberty Alliance. Other frameworks with similar goals are also being specified and deployed, including for example the not yet standardized WS* specification suite or UPnP. The supported model is general enough that it could also be extended to non-Web services frameworks.
</p>

<p>
While it is theoretically possible to write such a framework-based application using only low-level Web services protocol APIs, the programming required would be very complex and would require implementing high-level protocols and other logic already well-specified by the framework. It makes much more sense to provide developers with a standard API to wrap framework behavior so that they can concentrate on service and application specific logic only.
</p>

<p>
The proposed JSR will specify a high-level Service Connection API for JavaTM ME that supports a simple GCF-like model for application interaction with services. The API will also cover the configuration needed to bootstrap interaction with service frameworks.
</p>
</blockquote>
 

<p>
Reading between the lines, what this says is that SOAP/WSDL/etc. are still too complicated even when they hide the XML behind APIs like JAX-RPC so they need yet another layer separating the average developer
from the XML. While I don't deny that SOAP, WSDL, etc. are quite complex, maybe the problem is not the APIs? Maybe the problem is that the underlying specs are too complex and too poorly designed and no 
API is ever going to be able to hide that fundamental complexity? Maybe the solution should be to stop building systems on top of such baroque, rigid and  brittle foundations and instead build on top of simple, flexible systems like HTTP that bend instead of breaking? 
Just a thought. :-)
Comments are due by August 1.

The W3C XML Core Working Group has posted the proposed recommendation
of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/PR-xml-id-20050712/">xml:id Version 1.0</a>. This describes an idea that's been kicked around in the community for some time. The basic problem is how to link to elements by IDs when a document doesn't have a DTD or schema. The proposed solution is to predefine an <code>xml:id</code> attribute that 
would always be recognized as an ID, regardless of the presence or absence of a DTD or schema.
This draft loosens up error handling somewhat, but doesn't make any really major changes since the candidate recommendation.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, it's recently been discovered that 
this scheme is pretty badly incompatible with canonical XML, which likes to inherit attributes in the XML namespace onto descendant elements, thus moving xml:id's from one element to another. This has downstream effects on XML digital signatures and XML encryption.
</p>

<p>
 The working group has basically decided to blame canonical XML for the 
 problem, and not address it themselves.
 They're half right. Canonical XML should not have 
 assumed that all attributes in the XML namespace would act like <code>xml:lang</code> and <code>xml:space</code>; but it did; and 
 canonical XML is now a four-year old deployed recommendation.
<code>xml:id</code> is not. Moving 
forward with a spec with such an obvious known incompatibility
strikes me as less than wise, but I don't get a vote.

Specification Request (JSR) 105,  XML Digital Signature APIs</a>.

is disturbing. Designing APIs without attempting to write sample code and tutorials generally leads to APIs that are too hard to use, too hard to understand, have significant gaps in coverage, and spend excessive effort on parts nobody needs. When working on XOM, I don't consider anything complete until there's sample code and documentation, beyond merely the API documentation. The library developer's view of an API is all too often 
 too focused on a class's internals and not focused enough on what the library looks like to a client of the library. Writing tutorials and sample programs forces you to switch perspectives and results in cleaner, saner, simpler APIs.

IRIs rather than URIs</li>

<li>All attributes in the XLink namespace are now reserved for future versions of XLink.</li>

<li>Most importantly,
the <code>xlink:type="simple"</code> attribute is no longer required.</li>

</ol>

<p>
That is a simple link can now be written like this: 
</p>

<p><code>&lt;composer xlink:href="http://www.beand.com/">Beth Anderson&lt;/composer></code></p>

<p>
It's no longer necessary to write this:
</p>

<p><code>&lt;composer xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.beand.com/">Beth Anderson&lt;/composer></code></p>

<p>
This is a good thing. I'm not sure who first came up with this idea, but I've been advocating it for a while now. This makes XLink a lot more palatable in applications like XHTML 2 and SVG.

<a href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera Software</a> has posted the <a href="http://my.opera.com/forums/showthread.php?threadid=96020">first beta of
version 8.0.2</a> of their namesake $39 payware
web browser for Windows, Linux, and the Mac. 
The major new feature in this beta is Bit Torrent support. 
As usual Opera is marching to its own drummer.
Now that they've done it, BitTorrent support in the browser seems almost obvious; but they're first out of the gate.
However, they still haven't implemented some basic features everyone else has, most notably XSLT.
It feels reminiscent of the old Mac word processor 
Nisus Writer. Half the time you felt like you were using your grandkids' word processor and the other half the time you felt like you were using your grandfather's. 
There's something to be said for clearing new territory instead of replowing the same old fields. However, in my experience failing to 
implement the core features of the market leader dooms one to being a niche player. There were users who swore by (and at) Nisus Writer; but most authors, myself included, just couldn't get past the lack of features we'd grown accustomed to in Word, WordPerfect, and other more conventional products. We liked Nisus's macro language, non-contiguous selection, regular expressions, Unicode support, and other features the market leaders wouldn't add for years to come. But we just could never quite get over the features we missed from Word. For me, outline mode was the killer. 
Opera feels similar. It's really, really nice; and really stands out from the crowd in so many ways. But damn it, I just can't stomach a browser that won't do XSLT so I stay with Firefox.

third last call working draft of <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-ccxml-20050629/">Voice Browser
Call Control: CCXML Version 1.0</a>. According to the spec
abstract, " CCXML is designed to provide telephony call
  control support for dialog systems, such as VoiceXML. While CCXML can be
  used with any dialog systems capable of handling media, CCXML has been designed to complement and integrate with a VoiceXML
  interpreter. Because of this there are many references to VoiceXML's capabilities and limitations. There are also details on
  how VoiceXML and CCXML can be integrated. However, it should be noted that the two languages are separate and are not
  <em class="RFC2119">REQUIRED</em> in an implementation of either language. For example, CCXML could be integrated with a more
  traditional Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system or a 3GPP Media Resource Function (MRF), and VoiceXML or other dialog
  systems could be integrated with other call control systems." 
 There've been lots of significant changes since the last draft. 
Comments are due by July 29.

The W3C Quality Assurance Working Group has posted the  proposed recommendation  of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/PR-qaframe-spec-20050629/">QA Framework: Specification Guidelines</a>. According to the abstract, "Much effort goes into writing a good specification. It takes more than knowledge of the technology to make a specification precise, implementable and testable. It takes planning, organization, and foresight about the technology and how it will be implemented and used. The goal of this document is to help W3C editors write better specifications, by making a specification easier to interpret without ambiguity and clearer as to what is required in order to conform. It focuses on how to define and specify conformance for a specification. Additionally, it addresses how a specification might allow variation among conforming implementations. The document contains a set of guidelines or requirements, supplemented with good practices, examples, and techniques."

"This document analyzes how design decisions of a specification's conformance
model may affect its implementability and the
interoperability of its implementations. To do so, it introduces
the concept of <dfn>variability</dfn> - how much implementations
conforming to a given specification may vary among themselves - and
presents a set of well-known <dfn>dimensions of
variability</dfn>. 
Its goal is to raise awareness of the potential cost that some
benign-looking decisions may have on interoperability and to
provide guidance on how to avoid these pitfalls by better
understanding the mechanisms induced by variability."

The XML Apache Project has released <a href="http://xmlbeans.apache.org/">XMLBeans 2.0</a>, one of 
many XML data binding frameworks for Java.
This one is  based on the W3C  XML
Schema Language and
 also provides access to the full underlying XML Infoset 
through an  XML Cursor API. New features in 2.0 include:
</p>

<ul>
<li> XQuery/XPath integration </li>

  
<li>DOM Level 2 </li>

  
<li>Support for  custom methods to generated
XMLBeans. </li>
  
<li>Error codes</li>

<li>Fail-fast behavior  for
simple types</li>

<li>Access to the post schema validation infoset during validation</li>
  
  
<li>Java 1.5 Generics in generated code if you like.</li>

  
<li>Tools for generating schemas from instance documents and vice versa</li>
</ul>

<p>
This release also claims to increase performance. However, some of that comes from using the Piccolo XML parser, which concerns me. 
Piccolo was a promising non-validating parser written in Java using a compiler generator instead of a hand-written parser. 
However, it has got more than a few bugs, and the developer hasn't made any progress on fixing them for a long time.
Perhaps the XMLBeans Project has started fixing those bugs themselves, which would be nice since it would be a shame to see an otherwise 
promising parser languish. However, if they haven't then that's a big step backward, and virtually guaranteed to introduce bugs into XMLBeans they may not have noticed yet.

Nikolaus Gebhardt has released <a href="http://xml.irrlicht3d.org/">irrXML 1.1</a>, a
small XML parser written in C++ with its own unique API. 
 These days I'm extremely skeptical of new parsers, especially ones that advertise speed and size benefits as irrXML does. All too often they achieve that by cutting corners on mandatory aspects of XML like well-formedness checking or the internal DTD subset. 
Perusing the API documentation I don't see any obvious mistakes.
The API
appears to be missing support for comments and processing instructions, but that's not illegal as long as these are parsed correctly. More seriously, the API doesn't appear to have any namespace support, so this would tend to rule out irrXML for general purpose XML processing.

I've posted the second beta release of 
<a href="http://www.xom.nu/unstable.html">XOM 1.1</a>, my free-as-in-speech (LGPL)
dual streaming/tree-based API for processing XML with Java.
Version 1.1 maintains backwards compatibility with XOM 1.0 while adding a number of important new features including XPath queries, document subset canonicalization, exclusive XML canonicalization,
external XSLT parameters, and <code>xml:id</code> support. 
The API is now considered to be reasonably stable, and probably won't change before 1.1 final. 
Beta 2 is primarily a bug fix release.
Numerous bugs have been fixed in XPath. In 
addition a couple of other random issues have been fixed including 
namespace handling in SAX conversion and attribute parentage in
copied elements.
This release probably introduces a lot of bugs in serialization with 
Unicode Normalization Form C (NFC), though as yet I haven't proved that. Addressing this will be a major focus for beta 3. If anyone has test cases that demonstrate incorrect handling of NFC, I'd appreciate it if you'd send those my way.
Beta 2 also make some optimizations that should slightly decrease
the memory footprint. 
XOM requires Java 1.2 or later and is published under the LGPL.

I've 
posted beta 7
of <a href="http://jaxen.org/releases.html">Jaxen 1.1</a>, an open source 
(modified BSD license) XPath 1.0 engine for Java that is adaptable to many different object models including XOM, JDOM, DOM, and dom4j. 
Jaxen was originally written by James Strachan and Bob McWhirter.
Brian Ewins also did a lot of work for this release.
Beta 7 expands the JavaDoc, improves compatibility with both Java 1.4 and 1.5, fixes some thread safety issues, modularizes the test suite,
and addresses numerous  areas where Jaxen wasn't 
correctly implementing the XPath specification including:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Operator associativity</li>
	<li>Correctly counts characters from beyond the Basic Multilingual Plane</li>
	<li>Improved string functions including string-length, translate, and substring</li>
	<li>Proper formatting of Inf and NaN</li>
</ul>

<p>
While there's always the possibility (certainty?) 
of as yet unnoticed bugs, I think all known issues in the core have now been addressed. There are still a couple of issues in the JDOM navigator to deal with. All users should upgrade
to this release. Several users have reported problems where the more rigorous checking in the latest betas have uncovered mistakes in their XPath expressions. If you try this release and something that used to work now fails, please check to see if the expression was correct in the first place. The current betas are much stricter and less forgiving than the older versions. In all cases I'm aware of, rewriting the expressions in correct XPath 1.0 syntax was easy and fixed the problems. 
Don't be fooled by the "beta" designation. 
This release has many fewer bugs and is much more 
conformant to the XPath specification than the official 1.0 release. We'll probably get around to calling it 1.1 final sometime later this year after doing more work on testing,
documentation, performance, and code cleanup. 
However, there's no reason to wait for that. If you're using Jaxen, you should upgrade to this beta.

Michael Kay has released <a href="http://saxon.sourceforge.net/#F6.5.4">version 6.5.4 of Saxon</a>, an XSLT 1.0 processor written in Java. 
Saxon is open source under the Mozilla Public License.
Java 1.1 or later is required. This release fixes assorted bugs,
but adds no new features.
</p>

<p>
Saxon's a very fast XSLT processor that's reasonably conformant to the specification (it still misses a few corner cases); but it's a classic example of how not to run an open source project. The source is available, but only just. The source code repository isn't public.
Most importantly there are no test cases. They exist but they've never been released. (I hope to address part of the reason for this in my paper at Extreme Markup Languages in August.) 
Essentially only Michael Kay can update the software, fix bugs, or add features. 
This release only happened because Ken Holman organized a group of people  to pay Kay to make a new release. 
I had suggested that they pay Kay to release the test suite rather than simply fixing a few bugs, but 
the group was more interested in a quick fix for a few nagging issues than establishing a solid foundation for long term product development. However,
the bugs that still exist are unlikely to ever be fixed. 
</p>

<p>
XOM originally bundled Saxon. However, I switched to Xalan not because it was faster or more conformant, but because there was a reasonable expectation that any  bugs I uncovered would be fixed. Ditto, I use Jaxen instead of Saxon for XPath because I can mostly 
fix the bugs I find  in Jaxen myself. I don't have to rely on someone else's availability and interest. Despite this recent update, Saxon still has a lot of bugs that aren't being addressed. If you're still using Saxon 6, then you should upgrade to Saxon 6.5.4; but most users should consider Xalan, libxml, or some other product instead.

Once again, I'll be chairing the XML track for
Software Development 2006 West in Santa Clara next March.
 The <a href="http://www.cmpevents.com/SDw6/a.asp?option=N">Call for Proposals</a> for is now live.
Besides XML, tracks include Web Services, Java, Emerging Technologies, C++, Requirements &amp; Analysis, Testing &amp; Quality,
.NET,  Mobile Development, Security, and People, Process, and Methods.
We also have one new track this year, the Business of Software. 
 Most sessions are 90 minute classes, but we also have room for half and full-day tutorials (I prefer half-day tutorials in the XML track), birds-of-a-feather sessions, and panels. 
Submissions are due by August 6th.
</p>

<p>
For the XML track, we're interested in practical sessions 
 covering all aspects of XML. This is not specifically an XML show, so we tend to find that our audience responds better to more practical, how-to, basic sessions as opposed to more theoretical, high-level sessions.
For instance, a simple introduction to XQuery would go over better than 
a detailed comparison of XQuery optimization techniques. 
One thing previous attendees have told us is that they'd like to see more new sessions at each show, so we're going to be looking preferentially 
for talks that have not previously been given at SD West.

The XML Apache Project has released <a href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces2-j/">Xerces-J 2.7</a>, a major upgrade to the preeminent open source XML parser for Java.
</p>


<blockquote>
<p>
This release provides a complete implementation of the parser related 
portions of JAXP 1.3 and also brings Xerces into compliance with SAX 
2.0.2, the DOM Level 3 Core and Load/Save W3C Recommendations, the XML 
Inclusions (XInclude) Version 1.0 W3C Recommendation and the XML Schema 
1.0 Structures and Datatypes Second Edition W3C Recommendations.
</p>

<p>
Xerces-J 2.7.0 incorporates two minor changes to the Xerces Native 
Interface. A new package org.apache.xerces.xs.datatypes has been added to 
Xerces' XML Schema API that provides a full schema datatype to object 
mapping. In addition, in this release we introduced many new parser 
features, improved parser performance in several areas and fixed many 
bugs.
</p>

<p>
Specifically, the significant changes introduced in this release are:
</p>

<ul>
	<li> Implemented the following packages defined by JAXP 1.3: javax.xml.datatype, javax.xml.parsers and javax.xml.validation.</li>

	<li> Defined and implemented interfaces (org.apache.xerces.xs.datatypes) for accessing actual values.</li>

	<li> Implemented a feature that instructs the schema processor to use all schema location hints for a given target namespace when locating components.</li>

	<li> Implemented partial experimental support for the first working draft of XML Schema 1.1 Structures and Datatypes.</li>

	<li> Implemented features for configuring whether the XInclude processor performs base URI fixup and/or language fixup.</li>

	<li> Implemented the XInclude Recommendation (December 2004).</li>

	<li> Fixed a bug which caused the DTD validator to be activated when using the XInclude processor with schema validation turned on.</li>

	<li> Modified the XNI XMLLocator interface to include getCharacterOffset and getXMLVersion. Added a getCharacterOffset method to XMLParseException.</li>

	<li> Made various modifications to support the reporting of character offsets in XNI and DOM.</li>

	<li> Implemented SAX 2.0.2 and SAX2 Extensions 1.1.</li>

	<li> Fixed SAX conformance bugs including one concerning skipped entities.</li>

	<li> Implemented a feature that allows schema annotations to be validated.</li>

	<li> Added support for generating synthetic annotations when a schema component has non-schema attributes but no child annotation.</li>

	<li> Reimplemented Text.replaceWholeText and TypeInfo.isDerivedFrom according to the DOM Level 3 Core Recommendation.</li>

	<li> Created two new parser configurations that support XML 1.1.</li>

	<li> Improved the performance of the SymbolTable, processing of attribute values and parsing of relative URIs.</li>

	<li> Added support for EntityResolver2 and LSResourceResolver to XMLCatalogResolver.</li>

</ul>

       New features in 1.1 for XML developers 
       include:
       </p>
       
 <ul>
	<li>      CSS @-moz-document selector for matching on site/document URL, useful in user stylesheets</li>

<p>Other new features in 1.1 include:</p>
       
<ul>
	<li>Sanitize "provides an easy way to quickly remove browsing history, cookies, cache, saved form information, and other personal data. The items to be removed can be customized, and the feature can be activated using either a keyboard shortcut or through a menu item."</li>

	<li>When viewing images, tab icons now display thumbnails of the displayed image.</li>

	<li>"Much faster session history navigation. The feature is off by default but can be enabled for testing purposes by setting the browser.sessionhistory.max_viewers preference to a nonzero number."</li>

	<li>FTP users are prompted for a name and password if anonymous access fails.</li>

  
	<li>Report a broken website wizard</li>

	<li>Changes made in the Preferences window now apply immediately</li>

	<li>Searchable download actions manager</li>

	<li>Searchable cookie manager</li>

Google has released version 0.1 of  
<a href="http://goog-ajaxslt.sourceforge.net/">AJAXSLT</a>, an open source  implementation of XSLT in JavaScript, of all things.
It's intended to be used in browsers. I'm skeptical.
Why not just use the browser's built-in XSLT engine and maybe DOM level 3 XPath? Except for Opera and Lynx, I think pretty much all major browsers 
have XSLT support these days. Still, according to the README:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
 Safari/2.0 has XSL-T built in, but it is not exposed to JavaScript,
 but is only applied to XML documents that have a stylesheet
 declaration when they are loaded.
</p>

<p>
 Internet Explorer exposes XSLT via the transformNode() method on the
 XML DOM. However, this is not available if ActiveX is disabled.
</p>

<p>
 Firefox exposes XSLT via the XSLTProcessor() object, however XPath
 is not exposed in the DOM. TODO(mesch): verify this.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Still, before reinventing the wheel, I'd prefer to work on improving the XSLT/XPath support in at least Firefox and Konqueror,
the open source base for Safari. Implementing XPath alone is non-trivial, much less XSLT doing it in browser JavaScript strikes me as insane and unlikely to succeed. Just scanning the source code I can see lots of unimplemented functions, and lots of places they made the same mistakes we made in Jaxen. For instance they've got the same bug in counting characters in strings that I fixed a couple of days ago in Jaxen. XPath and XSLT have a lot of weird corner cases to deal with.

Planamesa Software has released <a href="http://www.planamesa.com/neojava/">NeoOffice/J 1.1</a>,

NeoOffice is

Mac OS X 10.2 or later is required. NeoOffice is published exclusively under the GPL. 
</p>

<p>
This is one of the things I love about open source software.
When one team fumbles the ball (as Sun did rather embarrassingly with their Mac port of OpenOffice) someone else can pick it up and run with it.
Furthermore, two different teams can run toward the same goal along different paths to see who gets their first.
It sounds like an inefficient duplication of resources, and it is; just like a &lt;sarcasm>competitive marketplace is an inefficient duplication of resources compared to a nice, managed economy.&lt;/sarcasm> 
(We all know how well those turn out.) 
In this case, the official X-Windows-based solution for Mac OS X proved to be an unmitigated disaster. 
Planamesa's Java-based approach actually worked. Of course, there was no way to know that one approach would work and one would fail  until two different groups tried it both ways.

The W3C Voice Browser working group has published a new note
on <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/NOTE-access-control-20050613/">Authorizing Read Access to XML Content Using the &lt;?access-control?> Processing Instruction 1.0</a>. In brief, this proposes using a processing instruction like
<code>&lt;?access-control allow="*.poly.edu *.elharo.com"?></code>
to specify who gets to see a particular document. According to the introduction,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
 A plethora of applications and data are exposed as XML over HTTP. User agents such as Voice and Web browsers fetch and execute applications but restrict the XML content accessible to those applications merely to the URLs located in the same domain as the application. To take advantage of the rich XML content available on the Web, application developers must resort to proxying the content through the domain hosting their application thereby increasing overhead and limiting scalability.
</p>

<p>
This note describes a mechanism being used in the industry that allows a content provider to use a processing instruction embedded within the XML content to specify the access policy of that content. In this model a user agent can safely extend the sandbox in which it has restricted the application to include access to the XML content if and only if the specified policy grants permission. 
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Although this comes out of the Voice group, it's more generally applicable and should probably be taken up by the XML Core group, though I doubt it will be. Processing instructions are decidedly out of fashion at the W3C these days.
Personally, I'm not sure whether or not this is a good idea; but I'm always happy to see a new example of processing instructions since that means I can stop using the same tired old <code>&lt;php></code> and <code>&lt;xml-stylesheet</code> examples in my books and talks. :-)

The W3C Voice Browser Working Group has posted the candidate recommendation of
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/CR-voicexml21-20050613/">VoiceXML 2.1</a>, an XML vocabulary
for creating audio dialogs that feature synthesized speech, digitized audio, recognition of spoken and DTMF key input, recording of spoken input, telephony, and mixed initiative conversations.
According to the spec, "The popularity of VoiceXML 2.0 [VXML2] spurred the development of numerous voice browser implementations early in the specification process. [VXML2] has been phenomenally successful in enabling the rapid deployment of voice applications that handle millions of phone calls every day. This success has led to the development of additional, innovative features that help developers build even more powerful voice-activated services. While it was too late to incorporate these additional features into [VXML2], the purpose of VoiceXML 2.1 is to formally specify the most common features to ensure their portability between platforms and at the same time maintain complete backwards-compatibility with [VXML2]." New elements in VoiceXML 2.1 include <code>data</code> and <code>foreach</code>.

The W3C CSS Working Group has 
posted a new last call working draft of
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-CSS21-20050613">Cascading Style Sheets, level 2 revision 1</a>. According to the abstract, 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
CSS 2.1 builds on CSS2 [CSS2] which builds on CSS1 [CSS1]. It supports media-specific style sheets so that authors may tailor the presentation of their documents to visual browsers, aural devices, printers, braille devices, handheld devices, etc. It also supports content positioning, table layout, features for internationalization and some properties related to user interface.
</p>

<p>
CSS 2.1 corrects a few errors in CSS2 (the most important being a new definition of the height/width of absolutely positioned elements, more influence for HTML's "style" attribute and a new calculation of the 'clip' property), and adds a few highly requested features which have already been widely implemented. But most of all CSS 2.1 represents a "snapshot" of CSS usage: it consists of all CSS features that are implemented interoperably at the date of publication of the Recommendation.
</p>

<p>
CSS 2.1 is derived from and is intended to replace CSS2. Some parts of CSS2 are unchanged in CSS 2.1, some parts have been altered, and some parts removed. The removed portions may be used in a future CSS3 specification. Implementations may refer to CSS2 for the definitions of features that have been removed, but for other features CSS 2.1 is the normative reference.

I continue to be astonished at just how bad Spotlight is. This is what everyone was so excited about? Not only does it not limit itself to showing me the top hits. When it does show me all 452 hits for a simple search on "XPath Requirements" it doesn't even sort them by relevance. It knows which hit's the most relevant because it picks it as the top hit in the pop up menu. However, I can't open it from there in my text editor. It insists on opening the file in my browser. And when I try to use the standard "type the first few characters of the file name" approach to jump to the file I want in the results window, Spotlight instead starts a new search. 
And then there's no back button to return to the previous search. Back buttons are what? 10 year old technology? Isn't Apple the company that practically invented Undo?
This is such astonishingly bad design. It is a real triumph of technology over user interface. Spotlight may use fancier algorithms than Google or Firefox or BBEdit, but it's impossible to tell because it's so hobbled by bad user interface design.

I've been trying to use Apple's Spotlight in Mac OS X Tiger lately. What astonishes me about this product is how as normally user-experience focused a company as Apple could have screwed up this badly. I'd expect this from Microsoft, but Apple?! This is a search engine technology thoroughly mired in the 1980s. They completely missed the lesson of Google. The problem is not to find every occurrence of a phrase anywhere it might be 
found as quickly as you can possibly find that. This just leaves the user floundering in hundreds or thousands of hits, with no easy way to choose between them. The real problem is to show the user only the hits they want to see, and Spotlight just doesn't do this. When I do a Spotlight search 
I struggle to find the one file I know is there somewhere
amidst many, many irrelevant results. Most of the time I give up and go back to a BBEdit multifile search. This may not be quite as fast as Spotlight is at finding things, but it makes it much faster for me to find the one file I'm actually looking for.

A lot of people have sent in various suggestions about making Firefox do google searches, but none of them meet the stated requirements: simply typing in a few keywords in the URL bar and pressing return, same as I would if I were typing in a real URL.
They all involve an extra step of one kind or another. 
I'm beginning to think this is going to require hacking Firefox. 
</p>

<p>
I did wonder how Mozilla did it so I went back and checked. Apparently I wasn't remembering it quite right. The difference between Mozilla and Firefox here is that when I type keywords into the Location bar, Mozilla tries to match that with a previously seen URL and provides the list of potential matches in a nice little popup menu like this one:
</p>

<img src="images/locationbarpopup.jpg" alt="" width="361" height="85" hspace="5" vspace="5" border="0" />

<p>
Firefox does the same thing except that it skips the last entry. That is, it never offers me a Google search as an option. 
I'll expand the question a little bit. Does anyone know how, if not exactly to solve the original problem, at least to make Firefox's location bar behave like Mozilla's and give me the option for a Google search in the URL autocomplete?

<p>
Here's a problem that's been bugging me for a few months. In Firefox I like to be able to type in a phrase or a keyword in the URL bar (<strong>not</strong> the search bar) and have it do a Google search. That works about 80% of the time, <em>except</em> when the search term includes a period. In that case, no matter what, Firefox interprets the search as a host name and responds with a  404. For instance, I can search for "Java 5"
but not "Java 1.5". I could swear I had this working
in Mozilla, but I've never been able to get Firefox to act like 
this. Does anyone know the last magic config option to make Firefox allow searches on the URL bar when the search terms contain periods? I'll offer a free copy of <cite>XML in a Nutshell</cite> (or another one of my books of your choosing) to the first reader who <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;elharo%40metalab%2Eunc%2Eedu?Subject=Firefox%20URL%20bar">responds</a> with a solution that fixes this problem.

Rant for the day: would web publishers everywhere 
please stop using footnotes and endnotes? Footnotes and endnotes are an ugly, horrid pitiful substitute for hypertext; and that's when they're used in print where they;re actually necessary.  
Books that make excessive use of footnotes are hard to follow and hard to read.

From the browser that wouldn't die department,
Netscape has released <a href="http://browser.netscape.com/ns8/">version 8.0</a> of its namesake web browser for Windows. 
Surprisingly Mac OS X and Linux have been pretty much abandoned. 
Netscape 8 chooses between the IE and the Gecko rendering engines
based on the trustworthiness of a site. Trusted sites 
are displayed using the Windows built-in IE HTML renderer. 
Untrusted sites are displayed using Gecko. (Personally I'd prefer to use Gecko exclusively, but then that's why I use Firefox.) 
Presumably Netscape 8 supports XML, XSLT, XHTML, HTML, and so forth because the underlying engines do. New features include
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Spyware protection</li>

	<li>Tabbed browsing  can open "all of your favorite web sites in one window automatically"</li>

<p> Malcolm Wallace and Colin Runciman have released
version 1.13 of <a

of the  XML processing library for the  Haskell language.
According to the web page, </p>

<blockquote> <p> <b>HaXml</b> is a collection of utilities for
using <a href="http://www.haskell.org">Haskell</a> and <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml">XML</a> together.  Its basic
facilities include: </p>

<ul> <li> a parser for XML,</li>
<li> a separate error-correcting
parser for HTML,</li>
<li> an XML validator,</li>
<li>
pretty-printers for XML and HTML.</li> </ul>

<p> For processing XML documents, the following components are
provided: </p> <ul> <li><em>Combinators</em> is a combinator
library for generic XML document processing, including
transformation, editing, and generation.</li>
<li><em>Haskell2Xml</em> is a replacement class for Haskell's
Show/Read classes: it allows you to read and write ordinary
Haskell data as XML documents.  The <em>DrIFT</em> tool
(available from <a
href="http://repetae.net/~john/computer/haskell/DrIFT/">
<tt>http://repetae.net/~john/computer/haskell/DrIFT/</tt></a>)
can automatically derive this class for you.</li>
<li><em>DtdToHaskell</em> is a tool for translating any valid XML
DTD into equivalent Haskell types.</li>

<li>In conjunction with the <em>Xml2Haskell</em> class framework,
this allows you to generate, edit, and transform documents as
normal typed values in programs, and to read and write them as
human-readable XML documents.</li>
<li>Finally, <em>Xtract</em>
is a <em>grep</em>-like tool for XML documents, loosely based on
the XPath and XQL query languages.  It can be used either from
the command-line, or within your own code as part of the
library.</li> </ul> </blockquote>

Benjamin Pasero has released
of <a href="http://rssowl.sourceforge.net/">RSSOwl 1.1.1</a>, an open source RSS reader written in Java and based on the SWT toolkit. 
RSSOwl is the best open source RSS client I've seen written in Java. 
That said, it still doesn't feel right to me. Even ignoring various small bugs and user interface inconsistencies, news just doesn't flow in this client.  
The three-pane layout that separates the news item titles from each news item 
doesn't work well for me.  
</p>
<hr />
<p>
Ranchero has released 
<a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire 2.0</a>, a closed source
RSS client for the Mac.
It's available in both free-beer lite and $29 payware versions.
Version 2.0 removes the weblog editor and adds Atom support, 
flagged items, searching, news persistence, and an embedded browser.
The payware version has a nice combined view that might actually convince me to finally start making heavy use of RSS. Or it would if the page up and page down keys worked in this view, but they don't. :-( 
I wonder why developers don't seem to understand that the purpose of these readers is to page through large quantities of information from multiple different sites as quickly as possible.
Having to individually select each item gets in the way of that. 
</p>

<p>
I guess RSS readers are a  new field, but
I remain amazed at the little annoyances like this that prevent me from 
adopting RSS/Atom. If this were open source I'd fix it myself, but it's not.
If RSSOwl were written to Swing, I could fix the problems there; but since it's written to SWT, I don't have the competence to do that. 
Ditto for Sage. I have fixed a few bugs in Sage, but the whole XUL process is too far afield from what I normally do for me to get seriously involved. <a href="https://jnn.dev.java.net/">JNN</a> is written in Java, and uses Swing as the widget toolkit. However, the developers have ignored the patches and bug reports I've sent in; and I'm not sure it's worth forking. If I want to maintain my own client, I'd probably start from scratch and release it under the GPL. The server based HTML clients have decent interfaces, but horrible privacy issues. Oh well, I suppose over time the bugs will get worked out.

The W3C XML Schema Working Group has  published a note on
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/NOTE-xml11schema10-20050511/">Processing XML 1.1
documents with XML Schema 1.0
processors</a>.
This note recommends ignoring the clear language of the W3C XML Schema 1.0 specification, specifically in regard to the xsd:QName, 
xsd:Name, xsd:NMTOKEN, xsd:QName and xsd:string
data types.
These data types are defined in terms of XML 1.0 rules rather than XML 1.1 rules.
To make matters worse, W3C XML Schema 1.0 language really isn't flexible or powerful enough to define extension types that can handle XML 1.1 names.
(I suppose it could theoretically be done, but I hate to imagine the regular expression that would do it.) 
</p>

<p>
The W3C has only themselves to blame for this debacle. 
Multiple people warned them about the problems that led  to this 
snafu multiple times during the development of both the W3C Schema Language and XML 1.1 and were repeatedly shouted down. Now there's a perfect storm where the individual problems in each spec are combining to create even bigger problems. Fortunately there are alternatives.
XML 1.0 continues to work just fine for almost all needs,
and RELAX NG is a vastly superior schema language for 
pretty much everything. Everyone I know doing practical work with XML is happily using XML 1.0 without even really being aware of XML 1.1. Many of these people are even more happily using RELAX NG. Not all good things flow from the W3C.

The W3C Device Independence Working Group has posted the last call  working draft of  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-cselection-20050502/">Content Selection for Device Independence (DISelect) 1.0</a>. According to the abstract, "This document specifies a syntax and processing model for general purpose content selection or filtering. Selection involves conditional processing of various parts of an XML information set according to the results of the evaluation of expressions. Using this mechanism some parts of the information set can be selected for further processing and others can be suppressed. The specification of the parts of the infoset affected and the expressions that govern processing is by means of XML-friendly syntax. This includes elements, attributes and XPath expressions. This document specifies how these components work together to provide general purpose selection."
</p>


<p> 
That sounds unobjectionable, but what the working group is 
really proposing  is XML markup that can be added to a page to indicate which devices certain content is appropriate for. For example, this <code>sel:if</code> element says that the image should only be displayed if the user's device supports color or has a window size wider than 500 pixels. 
</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div sel:expr="dc:cssmq-width('px') &amp;gt; 500" 
    &amp; dc:cssmq-color() &gt; 0" >
  &lt;object src="picture.png"/&gt;
&lt;/div></code></pre>

<p>
This feels more than a little like presentation based markup. 
This is very much like using JavaScript or server side programs to identify different browsers and send them content tailored specifically to them.  This syntax  is definitely easier-to-use, and more powerful  than the various JavaScript and server-side hacks people use today; but should we be doing this at all? 
Whatever happened to the vision of sending browsers XML documents with appropriate stylesheets and letting the client decide how to best present it? The thing that bothers me the most about this proposal is that the syntax mixes the presentation information straight into the document, rather than linking to it from a separate hints sheet. In many ways, this document seems to reflect a belief that the W3C has been going down the wrong road for the last eight years in attempting to separate content from presentation.

From the "I can't believe they're going to try this again" department, I note with both hope and trepidation that the W3C  XML Core Working Group has posted the first public working draft of the 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-xlink11-20050428/">XML Linking Language (XLink) Version 1.1</a>. XLink 1.0
has been one of the more obvious failures within the XML community. Adoption has been practically non-existent. On first read-through, however, the only substantive change I noted here is that XLinks contain
IRIs rather than URIs.  There appear to some editorial improvements as well, but I think the basic syntax remains the same.
</p>
<p>
Update: David Carlisle found a change I missed. 
The <code>xlink:type="simple"</code> attribute is no longer required.
That is a simple link can now be written like this: 
</p>

<p><code>&lt;composer xlink:href="http://www.beand.com/">Beth Anderson&lt;/composer></code></p>

<p>
It's no longer necessary to write this:
</p>

<p><code>&lt;composer xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.beand.com/">Beth Anderson&lt;/composer></code></p>

<p>
This is a good thing. I'm not sure who first came up with this idea, but I've been advocating it for awhile now. This makes XLink a lot more palatable in applications like XHTML 2 and SVG.

The W3C Multimodal Interaction Activity has posted the first public working draft of 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-mmi-arch-20050422/">Multimodal Architecture and Interfaces</a>. Quoting from the draft,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This document describes the architecture of the Multimodal
Interaction (MMI) framework and the interfaces between its
constituents. The MMI Working Group is aware that multimodal
interfaces are an area of active research and that commercial
implementations are only beginning to emerge. Therefore we do not
view our goal as standardizing a hypothetical existing common
practice, but rather providing a platform to facilitate innovation
and technical development. Therefore the aim of this design is to
provide a general and flexible framework providing interoperability
among modality-specific components from different vendors - for
example, speech recognition from one vendor and handwriting
recognition from another. This framework places very few
restrictions on the individual components or on their interactions
with each other, but instead focuses on providing a general means
for allowing them to communicate with each other, plus basic
infrastructure for application control and platform services.</p>

<p>Our framework is motivated by several basic design goals:</p>

<ul>
<li>Encapsulation. The architecture should make no assumptions about
the internal implementation of components, which will be treated as
black boxes.</li>
<li>Distribution. The architecture should support both distributed
and co-hosted implementations.</li>
<li>Extensibility. The architecture should facilitate the
integration of new modality components. For example, given an
existing implementation with voice and graphics components, it
should be possible to add a new component (for example, a
biometric security component) without modifying the existing

The W3C Compound Document Formats Working Group has published the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-CDRReqs-20050315/">second public Working Draft of Compound Document by Reference Use Cases and Requirements</a>. "The Compound Document Formats Working Group is producing recommendations on combining separate component languages (e.g. XML-based languages, elements and attributes from separate vocabularies), like XHTML, SVG, XForms, MathML, and SMIL, with a focus on user interface markups. When combining user interface markups, specific problems have to be resolved that are not addressed by the individual markups specifications, such as the propagation of events across markups, the combination of rendering or the user interaction model with a combined document. The Compound Document Formats working group will address this type of problems. This work is divided in phases and two technical solutions: combining by reference and by inclusion.
The group is addressing the semantics of combining markups, which goes beyond the mechanics and syntactical elements used to combine markups. The semantic of combining markup is, to a large extent, specific to any two markups being combined. For example, including SVG markup in an XHTML document can be done in various ways and there is a need to define how the combination is done and what it means, especially with regards to issues mentioned above (such as event propagation, user interactions or rendering)."</p>

<p>
This goes a little beyond specs like XLink and XInclude, in seeking to specify not just how an XML infoset is created from compound documents, but how DOM and various behaviors extend and interoperate across different namespaces used or referenced in the same document.
High-Level Requirements are
listed as:
</p>
<ul>
	<li> CDR MUST exploit existing specifications, favoring W3C specifications wherever possible and limit the definition of new markup unless absolutely required for integration purposes</li>
	<li> CDR MUST provide the ability for content developers to describe or author rich media content define Rich Multimedia Content</li>
	<li> CDR MUST specify a base set of formats, corresponding profiles and versions</li>
	<li> Each CDR profile and version MUST specify, which formats can be referenced</li>
	<li> CDR MUST specify, for each format, the element used to reference other formats, if any.</li>
	<li> CDR MUST specify generic integration techniques</li>
	<li> CDR MUST support temporal synchronization of dynamic content coming from multiple references, possibly with multiple references to the same source.</li>
	<li> CDR MUST support event mechanisms that cross namespace boundaries</li>
	<li> CDR MUST support scriptability</li>
	<li> CDR MUST say the allowed nesting level of referencing</li>
	<li> CDR MUST explain how scripting interacts between components and the parent document</li>
	<li> CDR profiles MUST specify how event propagation works across namespace boundaries.</li>
	<li> CDR profiles MUST specify how focus traversal works with referenced documents.</li>
	<li> CDR profiles MUST specify how link activation work with referenced document.</li>
	<li> CDR profiles MUST specify triggering of animations across namespaces.</li>
	<li> CDR MUST support fragment identifiers in cross-namespace interaction</li>
	<li> CDR profiles SHOULD provide a method for adding event handlers using declarative markup for the formats it uses</li>
	<li> CDR documents MUST cater for accessibility requirements</li>
	<li> CDR documents MUST support dynamic updating</li>
	<li> CDR must define its integration into the Web Architecture. It must include delivery over HTTP and should also strive to be transport independent</li>
	<li> CDR MUST NOT prevent compression of the data</li>
	<li> CDR MUST NOT prevent packaging of the data</li>
	<li> CDR User Agents MUST provide a default font for use by all components</li>
	<li> CDR MUST NOT prevent server-side adaptation</li>
	<li> CDR MUST support limited bandwidth networks and limited capability devices</li>
	<li> CDR Profiles MUST define clear document conformance criteria</li>
	<li> CDR Profiles MUST define clear user agent conformance criteria</li>
</ul>


<p>
Requirements for CDR Profile 1  (Rich Multimedia Content) are given as:
</p>
<ul>
	<li> CDR Profile 1 MUST specify a user interaction model</li>
	<li> CDR Profile 1 MUST explain how a User Agent is able to identify a CDR Profile 1 document</li>
	<li> CDR Profile 1 MUST support 2D scalable vector graphics</li>
	<li> CDR Profile 1 MUST support audio</li>
	<li> CDR Profile 1 SHOULD support video</li>
	<li> CDR Profile 1 MUST support grid, flow, overlapping layouts</li>
	<li> CDR Profile 1 MUST support SVG backgrounds</li>
	<li> CDR Profile 1 MAY support XHTML backgrounds</li>
	<li> CDR Profile 1 MUST support identification of markup and versions in CDF documents</li>
	<li> CDR Profile 1 MUST support scalable diagrams that can be animated and can cause link traversal</li>
	<li> CDR Profile 1 MUST define how to reference SVGT graphics and resources from an XHTML document</li>
	<li> CDR Profile 1 MUST support advertising the specific supported versions of formats and capabilities in headers</li>
	<li> CDR Profile 1 MUST support XHTML as a root/host language</li>
	<li> The XHTML &lt;object> element MUST be used for referring to other formats from XHTML</li>
	<li> CDR Profile 1 MUST define the interaction model for an SVG document referenced by an XHTML document</li>
	<li> CDR Profile 1 MUST define for animated SVG icons to act like HTML images (no need for interactivity, links, zoom and pan)</li>
	<li> CDR Profile 1 MUST define a way for events to trigger SVG animation</li>

The W3C Web Services Addressing Working Group has 
posted a new working draft of 
 <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-ws-addr-wsdl-20050413">Web Services Addressing - WSDL Binding</a>. According to the abstract,
"Web Services Addressing provides transport-neutral mechanisms to address Web services and messages. Web Services Addressing 1.0 - WSDL Binding (this document) defines how the abstract properties defined in Web Services Addressing 1.0 - Core are described using WSDL." Interesting note: "The Web Services Addressing Working Group has decided to use XML Schema, where appropriate, to describe constructs defined in this specification. Note that this restricts use of Web Services Addressing to XML 1.0." Changes in this draft are mostly editorial, and include using IRIs instead of URIs.

 The W3C 
 RDF Data Access Working Group has published the third public working draft of 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-rdf-sparql-query-20050419/">SPARQL Query Language for RDF</a>.
According to the introduction,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An RDF graph is a set of triples, each triple consisting of a <em>subject</em>,
  a <em>predicate</em> and an <em>object</em>, as defined in
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-rdf-concepts-20040210/">RDF Concepts and Abstract syntax</a>. These triples can come from a variety of
  sources. For instance, they may come directly from an RDF
  document. They may be inferred from other RDF triples.  They may be
  the RDF expression of data stored in other formats, such as XML or
  relational databases.</p>

  <p><acronym title="SPARQL Protocol And RDF Query Language">SPARQL</acronym> is a
  query language for getting information from such RDF graphs. It provides
  facilities to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>extract information in the form of URIs, blank nodes, plain and typed 
    literals.</li>

    <li>extract RDF subgraphs.</li>

    <li>construct new RDF graphs based on information in the queried graphs.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>As a data access language, it is suitable for both local and
  remote use. When used across networks, the companion <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-protocol/">SPARQL Protocol for RDF</a> document  describes a remote access protocol.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
Here's a simple example SPARQL query adapted from the draft:
</p>

<pre>PREFIX  dc: &lt;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/>
PREFIX  : &lt;http://example.org/book/>
SELECT  $var
WHERE   { :book1  dc:title  $var }</pre>

<p>
The <code>$</code> indicates a variable name. 
This query stores the 
title of a book in a 
variable named <code>var</code>. There are boolean and numeric operators as well.

I've posted the first beta release of 
<a href="http://www.xom.nu/unstable.html">XOM 1.1</a>, my free-as-in-speech (LGPL)
dual streaming/tree-based API for processing XML with Java.
Version 1.1 maintains backwards compatibility with XOM 1.0 while adding a number of important new features including XPath support.
The API is now considered to be reasonably stable, and probably won't change before 1.1 final. 
The primary addition to beta 1 are workarounds for
several more Crimson bugs in the handling of the internal DTD subset. 
Beta 1 also 
makes a few small optimizations and fixes a few bugs in XPath.
Beta 1 requires Java 1.4 or later due to some changes in the underlying Jaxen XPath engine. This is a temporary situation.
Beta 2 will return to the previous requirements of Java 1.2 or later.

The Apache Web Services Project has posted version 0.4 of <a href="http://ws.apache.org/jaxme/">JaxMe 2</a>,
an open source implementation of the Java API for XML Binding.
Quoting from the web page,
</p>


<blockquote>
<p>
        JaxMe 2 is an open source implementation of
        <a href="http://java.sun.com/xml/jaxb/"><span class="codefrag">JAXB</span></a>, the specification for
        Java/XML binding. 
      </p>

      <p>A Java/XML binding compiler takes as input a schema
        description (in most cases an XML schema but it may be a DTD, a
        RelaxNG schema, a Java class inspected via reflection or a database
        schema). The output is a set of Java classes:
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A Java bean class compatible with the schema description. (If the schema was
            obtained via Java reflection, then the original Java bean class.)</li>
          <li>An unmarshaller that converts a conforming XML document into the equivalent Java bean.</li>
          <li>Vice versa, a marshaller that converts the Java bean back into the original XML document.</li>
        </ul>
      <p>

        In the case of JaxMe, the generated classes may also
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Store the Java bean into a database. Preferably an XML database like
            <a href="http://exist.sf.net/"><span class="codefrag">eXist</span></a>,
            <a href="http://xml.apache.org/xindice/"><span class="codefrag">Xindice</span></a>, or
            <a href="http://www.softwareag.com/tamino/"><span class="codefrag">Tamino</span></a>, but it may also
            be a relational database like <a href="http://www.mysql.com/"><span class="codefrag">MySQL</span></a>.
            (If the schema is sufficiently simple. :-)</li>
          <li>Query the database for bean instances.</li>

          <li>Implement an EJB entity or session bean with the same abilities.</li>
        </ul>
      <p>
        In other words, by simply creating a schema and running the JaxMe binding
        compiler,
        you have automatically generated classes that implement the complete
        workflow of a typical web application:</p>

I'm pleased to announce that I'll be speaking at <a href="http://www.sdexpo.com/">Software Development Best Practices</a> in Boston in September. This will be my first time at this show since it was changed its name and focus from Software Development East. I'll be presenting four sessions:  
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Testing GUIs with Abbot and Costello</li>
	<li>Testing XML</li>
	<li>User Interface Principles in API Design</li>
	<li>Effective XML</li>

I'll also be hosting a round table on 
"XForms, Web Forms, or What? The next generation of rich user interfaces".
I should stress that, today's quote notwithstanding, I don't 
have a strong opinion about what the right answer is (or answers are)
to the question of what next generation client technology should we be using. I've spent some time looking at XForms myself, but I haven't really explored XUL, XAML, WebForms 2.0, and other possibilities. I do hope, however, that we'll have some strong opinions on the panel from various camps. Anyone interested in participating as a panelist around that table, should <a href="mailto:elharo@metalab.unc.edu?Round%20Table">drop me a line</a>. Ideally I'd like to have representatives from the Microsoft, Mozilla, WHAT, and XForms camps.

Linspire has posted the fourth pre-release of <a href="http://www.nvu.com/">NVU (pronounced N-view) 1.0</a>,
an open source
GUI HTML editor for Mac OS X, Linux, and Windows based on
Mozilla Composer. The software looks reasonably slick, but I'm still not 
ready to give up BBEdit for it. The general flow of using the application 
is pretty rough. Saving is poorly designed, with an unnecessary distinction between publishing and saving, and lots of confusing dialog boxes. 
I could figure it out if I really wanted to, but my wife couldn't. 
If there's any way to check the links in a document, I couldn't find it. 
Mozilla Composer was never a particularly a good HTML editor in the first place, and while NVU cleans up some of the more obvious editing problems it's done little to fix the underlying problems. 
If I'm giving a GUI editor to someone who can't type HTML, I don't expect them to understand FTP or URL syntax either. Here's my test for a useful GUI editor that NVU flunked massively: 
</p>

<ol>
	<li>Spot a typo. </li>
	<li>Edit the word to fix the typo, just like I would in my word processor.</li>
	<li>Select File/Save or Ctrl-S, and have the page saved with the typo corrected.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Note what is not involved here:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Figuring out where on the site to save the page. The page already exists. Put it in the same place.</li>

	<li>Giving the name of the file. The page already has a name, even if it's index.html and I edited "http://www.cafeaulait.org/"</li>
</ul>

<p>
I could (barely) accept the editor asking for a user name and a password, provided it only asked once and never asked for it if it didn't need it. 
But that's it. Otherwise, editing a page should be just as easy as editing a file in a word processor like Word, or even OpenOffice (to lower the bar some). NVU doesn't come close to that standard.

Apple has released <a href="http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/macosxupdate1039.html">Mac OS X 10.3.9</a>.
I'm very hesitant to install this update (available through System Update) because it seems to be breaking Java left and right. Many Java developers and end users of Java applications such as Limewire
are reporting core dumps and kernel panics after installing this update. 
(Reinstalling <a href="http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/securityupdate2005002macosx1034orlater.html">Security Update 2005-002</a> may fix the problem.)
Nonetheless, there is one new feature in this update that's of interest to XML developers. 10.3.9 updates the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/safari/">Safari web browser</a> to 1.3 which, among other new features, finally adds support for client-side XSLT.
The XSLT engine is the Gnome Project's libxslt.

we could finally start publishing XML+XSLT on the Web.

The W3C Scalable Vector Graphics Working 
Group has posted the
last call working draft of
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-SVGMobile12-20050413/">Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) Tiny 1.2</a> and a 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-SVG12-20050413/">placeholder document for the next version of
Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) 1.2 Full</a>.
According to the SVG Full Draft (which is only
about two pages long):
</p>

<blockquote>
 The previous drafts of this specification expressed the SVG 1.2 Full language as extensions to SVG 1.1 Full. SVG 1.2 Tiny was expressed as a profile of this specification and referenced both SVG 1.1 and SVG 1.2 Full. Feedback from implementors and reviewers indicated that this made both specifications unnecessarily difficult to understand. The latest draft of SVG 1.2 Tiny is described as a complete language specification, with no dependencies on other SVG specifications. In future drafts SVG 1.2 Full be will refactored as extensions to SVG 1.2 Tiny, forming a superset. It will not have a dependency on the SVG 1.1 Full specification, only on SVG Tiny 1.2. At this time the refactored SVG 1.2 Full specification is not ready for publication. Therefore this placeholder documentation is being published to inform the SVG community and provide redirection of links for other referencing documentation.
</blockquote>

<p>
Beyond this major editorial shift, changes in the tiny draft are substantive but detailed. They include
</p>

<ul>
	<li>IRIs are used instead of URIs. </li>
	<li>Attributes with boolean values have been changed to use enumerations, to allow extensibility.</li>
	<li>wallclock has been removed.</li>
	<li>The <code>page</code> and <code>pageSet</code> elements have been removed.</li>
	<li>Added <code>discard</code> element and <code>playbackOrder</code> attribute.</li>
	<li>Removed <code>streamedContents</code> attribute.</li>
	<li> The opacity property has been added to the <code>image</code> element.</li>
 
	<li> The <code>textArea</code> and associated elements replace the previous Flowing Text features.</li>
	<li> 'editable' is now allowed on <code>text</code> elements with children, but the children are flattened when editing occurs</li>

	<li>The <code>animation</code> element has been added.</li>

I've 
posted beta 5 
of <a href="http://jaxen.org/releases.html">Jaxen 1.1</a>, an open source 
(modified BSD license) XPath 1.0 engine for Java that is adaptable to many different object models including XOM, JDOM, DOM, and dom4j. 
Jaxen was originally written by James Strachan and Bob McWhirter.
Don't be fooled by the "beta" designation. I've spent a lot of time over the last three months fixing bugs in Jaxen.
This release has many fewer bugs and is much more 
conformant to the XPath specification than the official 1.0 release. We'll probably get around to calling it 1.1 final sometime later this year after doing more work on testing,
documentation, performance, and code cleanup. 
However, there's no reason to wait for that. If you're using Jaxen, you should upgrade to this beta. Beta 5 fixes some bugs in DOM and XOM 
navigation, improves the JavaDoc, and can now be built from the source distribution
using Maven.

 <a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-mxd1.html">Managing XML data: A look ahead</a>. This is the first article 
 in an ongoing series in which I intend to explore issues that arise in collections of XML documents. Up till now a lot of my books and writings have focused on how to process individual XML documents.  However, some things that are easy when looking at documents one or two at a time become much more challenging when you have hundreds, thousands, or even millions to deal with. For instance, how do you even find the one document that contains the information you need from amidst such a large collection?
There's not a lot in XML and its related specification to help you with this. This first article introduces the series. Future articles will cover catalogs, MIME types, storing XML in databases, and more. If there's anything in particular you'd like to hear about in this series, please drop me a line.

<p> Dennis Sosnoski has posted the first release candidate
of <a
href="http://jibx.sourceforge.net/index.html">JiBX</a>, yet
another  open source (BSD license) framework for binding XML data to Java
objects using your own class structures. It falls into the
custom-binding document camp as opposed to the schema driven
binding frameworks like JaxMe and JAXB.
Quoting from the JiBX web
site, </p>

<blockquote> 
<p>JiBX is a framework for binding XML data to Java objects. It
lets you work with data from XML documents using your own class
structures. The JiBX framework handles all the details of converting
your data to and from XML based on your instructions. JiBX is designed
to perform the translation between internal data structures and XML with
very high efficiency, but still allows you a high degree of control
over the translation process.</p>

<p>How does it manage this? JiBX uses <i>binding
definition</i>
documents to define the rules for how your Java objects are converted to
or from XML (the <em>binding</em>). At some point after you've compiled
your source code into class files you execute the first part of the
JiBX framework, the <i>binding compiler</i>. This compiler enhances
binary class files produced by the Java compiler, adding code to handle
converting instances of the classes to or from XML. After running the
binding compiler you can continue the normal steps you take in assembling your
application (such as building jar files, etc.; as of Beta 3a you can also skip
this as a separate step and instead binding classes directly at runtime, though
this approach has some drawbacks).</p>

<p>The second part of the JiBX framework is the <i>binding
runtime</i>. The enhanced class files generated by the binding
compiler use this runtime component both for actually building objects
from an XML input document (called <i>unmarshalling</i>, in data
binding terms) and for generating an XML output document from objects
(called <i>marshalling</i>). The runtime uses a parser implementing
the XMLPull API for handling input documents, but is otherwise
self-contained.</p>

The W3C SVG and CSS Working Groups have  posted the third
public working draft <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-sXBL-20050405">SVG's XML Binding Language (sXBL)</a>. 
sXBL works like <i>literal result element used as stylesheet</i> 
is XSLT.
That is, an sXBL document
is an SVG document that 
can contain content from other namespaces.
This SVG document 
specifies bindings between elements in those namespaces and particular SVG shapes. When an SVG processor renders
			the complete document, it replaces the content from other namespaces with their SVG bindings. 
This would be more useful if it were also possible to have external sXBL documents (more like traditional stylesheets) 
that don't require the source document and the SVG to be  together in one place. Perhaps this will come in sXBL 2 some time down the road.
Ultimately, this would allow browsers to render XML documents
 that don't look remotely like text, such as MathML and MusicXML.
 If you're curious about this, you might be interested in <a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-sxbl1/">An early look at sXBL</a> I wrote for IBM developerWorks.

This morning I posted beta 4 of <a href="http://jaxen.org/releases.html">Jaxen 1.1</a>, an open source 
(modified BSD license) XPath 1.0 engine for Java that is adaptable to many different object models including XOM, JDOM, DOM, and dom4j. 
Jaxen was originally written by James Strachan and Bob McWhirter.
Don't be fooled by the "beta" designation. I've spent a lot of time over the last three months fixing bugs in Jaxen.
This release has many fewer bugs and is much more 
conformant to the XPath specification than the official 1.0 release. We'll probably get around to calling it 1.1 final sometime later this year after doing more work on testing,
documentation, performance, and code cleanup. 
However, there's no reason to wait for that. If you're using Jaxen, you should upgrade to this beta.

and fixes assorted bugs.
Saxon 8.4 is published in two versions for both of which 
Java 1.4 or later is required.
<a href="http://saxon.sf.net/">Saxon 8.4B</a> is an open source product  
published under the Mozilla Public License 1.0 that 
"implements the 'basic' conformance level for XSLT 2.0 and XQuery."
Saxon <a href="http://www.saxonica.com/">8.4SA</a> is a 
£250.00 payware version that "allows stylesheets and queries to import an XML Schema, to validate input and output trees against a schema, and to select elements and attributes based on their schema-defined type. Saxon-SA also incorporates a free-standard XML Schema validator.
In addition Saxon-SA incorporates some advanced extensions not available in the Saxon-B product. These include a try/catch capability for catching dynamic errors, improved error diagnostics, support for higher-order functions, and additional facilities in XQuery including support for grouping, advanced regular expression analysis, and formatting of dates and numbers."

<p>
On first glance, 
changes since the February working drafts
appear fairly minor and mostly editorial. One of the biggest
substantive changes is that error handling is now more consistent across different XSLT 2 processors. Processors are less often allowed the option of whether or not to recover from an error.
However at a user (as opposed to implementer) level, very little seems to have changed.

What scares me about "Not XML" is that the purveyors aren't going to be satisfied with designing simple filters that convert heir format into real XML for integration into the tool chain. 
As soon as they've defined their format, they're next going to look at "fixing" other specs to more efficiently support "Not XML". I think we need to reject this in advance. If the "Not XML" group is really serious about compatibility (which I doubt) they will agree that they will not propose or make <strong>any</strong> modifications to SAX, DOM, XPath, XSLT, XQuery, XInclude, the XML Infoset, or any other XML technology. 
They will not add methods to the XML APIs that receive byte arrays 
or double instead of char[] arrays and Strings. 
They will not add new properties to the Infoset. 
They will not add special functions to XSLT and XPath to process binary data. Of course, if they want to create new API and tools to process their Not XML format, that's fine; as long as they don't use the word "XML" to describe what they're doing. But I'm afraid that hijacking the underlying XML specification is just the first step toward a hostile takeover of the entire XML stack.

The W3C  XML Binary Characterization Working Group has 
published  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/NOTE-xbc-characterization-20050331/">XML Binary Characterization</a>.
Like Captain Renault in Casablanca 
 I'm shocked, shocked to find that the group "recommends that the W3C produce a 'binary XML' recommendation." 
This was pretty much a foregone conclusion from the get go. 
The group was formed by people who had already decided that real XML wasn't going to meet their needs. A few of them were even right about that. 
</p>

<p>
According to the draft, "The driving notion behind 'binary XML' is generally that it would provide an equally interoperable format with a different set of properties"; and right there the group's 
gone off the rails and started wandering into oxymoronism. Even a well-documented, well-supported, well-understood, well-implemented binary format will not be 
as interoperable as text. Text has important characteristics of intelligibility and redundancy that a binary format will not.
</p>

<p>
The draft is careful to put "binary XML" in quotes, but it's still wrong. Binary formats may have their uses, but they aren't  XML.
I propose we stop calling this teratoma 
XML anything and let it
live or die on its own merits. If it can't survive without hijacking the XML brand name, then it deserves to become extinct. But if the working group really just can't live without using the three capital letters X, M, and L, I have an alternate proposal for them. 
Instead of calling the format "binary XML", let's call 
it "Not XML". For example, 
</p>
<blockquote>
 This document describes the processes and results of the Not XML  Characterization Working Group in evaluating the need and feasibility of a "Not XML" recommendation. It includes an analysis of which properties such a format must possess. It recommends that the W3C produce a "Not XML" recommendation and enumerates the minimum requirements which this
"Not XML" recommendation must meet.
</blockquote>

<p>
The working group has determined a number of MUST properties for
their eventual Not XML format:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Directly Readable and Writable	</li>
	<li>Transport Independence</li>
	<li>Compactness	</li>
	<li>Human Language Neutral</li>
	<li>Platform Neutrality</li>
	<li>Integratable into XML Stack</li>
	<li>Royalty Free</li>
	<li>Fragmentable	</li>
	<li>Streamable	</li>
	<li>Roundtrip Support	</li>
	<li>Generality	</li>
	<li>Schema Extensions and Deviations	</li>
	<li>Format Version Identifier	</li>
	<li>Content Type Management</li>
	<li>Self Contained	</li>
</ul>

<p><!--
The penultimate one&mdash;Human Readable and Editable&mdash;is a bit of a surprise.
I don't know how they plan to pull that off. 
Even given the restrcited definition of human readbale and editable they're using, this rules out a lot of implementation possibilities. 
Some of the other requirements are also pretty strong.--> I predict they're not going to be able to create a format that satisfies all their musts. 
I also predict that this failure 
isn't going to stop them from recommending Not XML anyway. 
There's a long history of 
W3C working groups ignoring their requirements when they become inconvenient. 
</p>

<p>

The real problem here is not the decision to 
invent a new binary format. It's the effort to hijack the interoperable XML standard for  use cases it was never intended for, and in so doing break XML for everybody who's already using it successfully. 
The best case scenario is that this effort produces a spec that flops in the marketplace and is widely ignored. 
(cf. XML 1.1.) The worst case scenario is a universe of incompatible, opaque binary data and tools that no one can understand.
There's no chance this format will succeed. 
No one format will meet all needs. No one format can. 
Uber-solutions always fail. Think ADA, EBXML, or the Edsel. 
The only question is how much damage Not XML will do 
 while failing.

<p>
I've been thinking a lot about Wikis lately. One thing that has always turned me off about them is the reliance on weak plain text, when I really want to see (and receive) well-formed markup.
I wonder what would happen if I uploaded the original DocBook source
for <a href="books/xmljava/"><cite>Processing XML with Java</cite></a> into a DocBook Wiki?  Almost all of the book is still fairly up to date, but there are a few bits and pieces here and there I'd like to futz with; and it would be nice to cover XOM as well. (XOM was mostly invented out of my experience writing <cite>Processing XML with Java</cite>). I wonder if the authoring environment here is clean enough to get me (or others) to do that work? I don't have time to do this right now, but I think I will add it to my TODO list.

The W3C XML Schema Working Group has published the last call
 working draft of 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-xmlschema-ref-20050329/">XML Schema: Component Designators</a>.
This spec proposes a scheme for naming and 
identifying  XML Schema

<ul> <li>Simple and complex type definitions</li>
<li>Attribute
declarations</li>
<li>Element declarations</li>
<li>Attribute and

<li>Wildcards</li>
<li>Attribute uses</li>
<li>The master schema

<li>Facets</li> </ul>

<p> The goal is to be able to name, for example, the
literallayout notation in the DocBook schema, as well as every
other significant piece of the schema. These names could then be used as fragment identifiers in URI references that point to schemas. The draft gives these examples of the current syntax proposal in both abbreviated and full forms:

I've posted the third alpha release of 
<a href="http://www.xom.nu/unstable.html">XOM 1.1</a>, my free-as-in-speech (LGPL)
dual streaming/tree-based API for processing XML with Java.
Version 1.1 maintains backwards compatibility with XOM 1.0 while adding a number of important new features including XPath support.
Alpha 3 removes the internal dependence  on IBM's ICU, so the entire
distribution is smaller and more self-contained.
In fact, in Java 1.4 and later only the main XOM JAR archive should be required for almost all uses.
(<code>XOMTestCase</code> still requires junit.jar. However, if you're using that class you probably already have
JUnit in your classpath.)
The new normalization 
code has not yet been optimized. It is almost certainly slower than the old code.
Future releases will speed it up and make it smaller.
The effect on anything except NFC should be nominal. 
In addition, a few random bugs have been fixed, and the XIncluder now tries to use relative URLs in <code>xml:base</code> attributes where possible.

 The RDF Data Access Working Group has published the fourth public working draft of 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-rdf-dawg-uc-20050325/">RDF Data Access Use Cases and Requirements</a>.
According to the introduction,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The W3C's Semantic Web Activity is based on RDF's flexibility as a means of representing data. While there are several standards covering RDF itself, there has not yet been any work done to create standards for querying or accessing RDF data. There is no formal, publicly standardized language for querying RDF information. Likewise, there is no formal, publicly standardized data access protocol for interacting with remote or local RDF storage servers.
</p>

<p>
Despite the lack of standards, developers in commercial and in open source projects have created many query languages for RDF data. But these languages lack both a common syntax and a common semantics. In fact, the extant query languages cover a significant semantic range: from declarative, SQL-like languages, to path languages, to rule or production-like systems. The existing languages also exhibit a range of extensibility features and built-in capabilities, including inferencing and distributed query.
</p>

<p>
Further, there may be as many different methods of accessing remote RDF storage servers as there are distinct RDF storage server projects. Even where the basic access protocol is standardized in some sense—HTTP, SOAP, or XML-RPC—there is little common ground upon which to develop generic client support to access a wide variety of such servers.
</p>

<p>
The following use cases characterize some of the most important and most common motivations behind the development of existing RDF query languages and access protocols. The use cases, in turn, inform decisions about requirements, that is, the critical features that a standard RDF query language and data access protocol require, as well as design objectives that aren't on the critical path.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
Use cases include:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Finding an Email Address</li>
	<li>Finding Information about Motorcycle Parts</li>
	<li>Finding Unknown Media Objects</li>
	<li>Monitoring News Events</li>

Sun has posted the <a href="http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/edr/jsr222/index2.html">second early draft review
of Java Specification Request 222: Java&trade; API for XML Data Binding 2.0</a>. This makes various updates to support  align the spec with JAX-RPC 2.0 and support schema substitution groups. 
Java 1.5 will be required for JAXB 2.0. Earlier versions will not be supported.
Comments are due by April 22.
</p>

<!--
<p>
This whole spec is based on a very outmoded and discredited W3C XML Schema-centric view of the world. Most laughable line: 
"Any nontrivial application of XML will, then, be based upon one or more
schemas and will involve one or more programs that create, consume, and
manipulate documents whose syntax and semantics are governed by those
schemas;" and by "schemas" they really do mean W3C XML Schema Language schemas exclusively.  Hmm, I guess XSLT, DocBook, OpenOffice, SVG, XHTML, and RSS are all trivial, then?  But really, this spec gets things monstrously wrong in almost every paragraph. I don't think the authors have any clue just how myopic their view of XML really is.  
Comments are due by July 23, but sometimes it's best just to ignore fundamentally broken things and let them die a quiet death in the market.

The W3C Compound Document Formats Working Group has published the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-CDRReqs-20050315/">first public Working Draft of Compound Document by Reference Use Cases and Requirements</a>. "A compound document combines multiple formats, such as XHTML, SVG, XForms, MathML and SMIL. This draft introduces compounding by a reference like img, object, link, src and XLink. Compounding by inclusion is planned for a later phase."   
I think this goes a little beyond specs like XLink and XInclude, in seeking to specify not just how an XML infoset is created from compound documents, but how DOM and various behaviors extend and interoperate across different namespaces used or referenced in the same document.
High-Level Requirements are
listed as:
</p>

<ul>
	<li> CDR MUST exploit existing specifications, favoring W3C specifications wherever possible</li>
	<li> CDR SHOULD NOT define new markup unless absolutely required for integration purposes</li>

	<li> CDR MUST ensure that user agent controls work consistently regardless of the component that has focus</li>
	<li> CDR MUST support event mechanisms that cross namespace boundaries</li>
	<li> CDR MUST support scriptability</li>
	<li> CDR MUST say the allowed nesting level of referencing</li>
	<li> CDR MUST explain how scripting interacts between components and the host document</li>
	<li> CDR MUST explain which events get dispatched to the referenced document</li>
	<li> CDR profiles MUST define how eventing (such as events, focus or links) work across namespaces</li>
	<li> CDR profiles MUST specify how event propagation works across namespace boundaries.</li>
	<li> CDR profiles MUST specify how focus traversal works with referenced documents.</li>
	<li> CDR profiles MUST specify how link activation work with referenced document.</li>
	<li> CDR profiles MUST specify triggering of animations across namespaces.</li>
	<li> CDR MUST support fragment identifiers in cross-namespace interaction</li>
	<li> CDR MUST support a unified rendering model</li>
	<li> CDR profiles SHOULD provide a method for adding event handlers using declarative markup for the formats it uses</li>
	<li> CDR documents MUST cater for accessibility requirements</li>
	<li> CDR documents MUST support dynamic updating</li>
	<li> CDR must define its integration into the Web Architecture. It must include delivery over HTTP and should also strive to be transport independent</li>

	<li> CDR Profile 1 MAY define transparency support for XHTML backgrounds</li>
	<li> CDR Profile 1 MUST support identification of markup and versions in CDF documents</li>
	<li> CDR Profile 1 MUST support scalable diagrams that can be animated and can cause link traversal</li>
	<li> CDR Profile 1 MUST define how to reference SVGT graphics and resources from an XHTML document</li>

The W3C the Timed Text (TT) Working Group
has posted the second public working draft of 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-ttaf1-dfxp-20050314/">Timed Text (TT) Authoring Format 1.0 – Distribution Format Exchange Profile (DFXP)</a>. According to the abstract,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This document specifies the distribution format exchange profile (DFXP) of the
      timed text authoring format (TT AF) in terms of a vocabulary and semantics
      thereof.</p>
      <p>The timed text authoring format is a content type that represents timed text
      media for the purpose of interchange among authoring systems. Timed text is textual
      information that is intrinsically or extrinsically associated with timing
      information.</p>
      <p>The Distribution Format Exchange Profile is intended to be used for the purpose
      of transcoding or exchanging timed text information among legacy distribution
      content formats presently in use for subtitling and captioning functions.</p>
      <p>In addition to being used for interchange among legacy distribution content
      formats, DFXP content may be used directly as a distribution format, providing, for
      example, a standard content format to reference from a <code>&lt;text&gt;</code> or
      <code>&lt;textstream&gt;</code> media object element in a [SMIL2] document.</p>

BEA has published the proposed final draft of 
<a href="http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/pfd/jsr181/index.html"> Java Specification Request 181,
Web Services Metadata for the Java Platform</a>. According to the draft,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
This specification defines a simplified model for Web Services programming that is easy
to learn and rapid to develop. The J2EE standard deployment technologies, APIs, and
protocols require the J2EE developer to master a substantial amount of information. This
JSR reduces the amount of information required to implement Web Services on J2EE by
using metadata to declaratively specify the Web Services that each application provides.
The metadata annotates the Java source file that implements the Web Service. While the
metadata is human readable and editable using a simple text editor, graphical
development tools can represent and edit the Java source file using higher levels of
abstraction specific to Web Services. This is a simpler and more powerful development
environment than traditional coding tools that are used to develop source code using low
level APIs.
</p>

<p>
This specification relies on the JSR-175 specification - “A Program Annotation Facility
for the JavaTM Programming Language” - for the Web Services metadata that annotates a
Web Service implementation. This document is using JSR-175 features as described in
the Public Draft Specification of JSR-175.
</p>

<p>
JSR-181 defines the syntax and semantics of Web Services metadata and default values
to be used, but does not define a runtime or container environment. Instead, implementers
are expected to provide tools that map the annotated Java classes onto a specific runtime
environment. However while this specification does not constrain the Java environment
on which Web Services are run, it assumes a J2SE 5.0 compiler as well as the
functionality of the J2EE 1.4 containers. In particular, JSR-181 expects features such as
JAX-RPC 1.1 and JSR-109, along with the compiler and language extensions from JSR-
175 to be present.
</p>

<p>
A JSR-181 implementation must produce a deployable Java Web Service application that
can run on the target Java environment. The deployed application must exhibit the
proper behavior described by the Web Services metadata and Java source code. Any two
JSR-181 processors starting from the same valid annotated Java Web Services file will
produce equivalent Web Service applications, even though they may deploy on very
different Java environments. This ensures portability of JSR-181 compliant Java files.

Ryan Tomayko has posted  <a href="http://kid-template.sourceforge.net/">Kid 0.6</a>, "a simple Pythonic template language for XML based vocabularies. It was spawned as a result of a kinky love triangle between XSLT, TAL, and PHP."
The language is based on just six attributes: <code>kid:for</code>, <code>kid:if</code>, <code>kid:def</code>, <code>kid:content</code>, <code>kid:omit</code>, and <code>kid:replace</code>; each of which contains  a Python expression. Since this expression can point to externally defined functions, this is most of what you need. In addition there are attribute value templates similar to XSLT's, and <code>&lt;?python?></code> processing instructions can embed code directly in the XML document.
I'm not sure I approve of the use of processing instructions in the language, but I'm not sure I don't either. Not having to escape XML-significant symbols like <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&amp;</code> in the embedded code is convenient. 
Kid templates are compiled to Python byte-code and can be imported and invoked like normal Python code.
Kid templates generate SAX events and can be used with existing libraries that work along SAX pipelines. 
This release adds template inheritance, match templates, cElementTree support, and a refined Python API. 
Overall it looks like a fairly well-designed, well-thought out system that has clearly learned from the  mistakes of gnarly systems like PHP, JSP, and ASP.

</p>


<dl>
	<dt>JAXB</dt>

		<dd>Due primarily to scheduling concerns, JAX-RPC 1.0 defined its own data binding facilities. With the release of JAXB 1.0[9] there is no reason to maintain two separate sets of XML mapping rules in the Java™ platform. JAX-RPC 2.0 will delegate data binding-related tasks to the JAXB 2.0[10] specification that is being developed in parallel with JAX-RPC 2.0.  JAXB 2.0[10] will add support for Java to XML mapping, additional support for less used XML  schema constructs, and provide bidirectional customization of Java , XML data binding. JAX-RPC 2.0 will allow full use of JAXB provided facilities including binding customization and optional schema validation.</dd>


	<dt>SOAP 1.2</dt>

		<dd>Whilst SOAP 1.1 is still widely deployed, it’s expected that services will migrate to SOAP 1.2 now that it is a W3C Recommendation. JAX-RPC 2.0 will add support for SOAP 1.2 whilst requiring continued support for SOAP 1.1. WSDL 2.0 The W3C is expected to progress WSDL 2.0[11] to Recommendation during the lifetime of this JSR. JAX-RPC 2.0 will add support for WSDL 2.0 whilst requiring continued support for WSDL 1.1.</dd>

	<dt>WS-I Basic Profile 1.1</dt>

		<dd>JAX-RPC 1.1 added support for WS-I Basic Profile 1.0. WS-I Basic Profile 1.1 is expected to supersede 1.0 during the lifetime of this JSR and JAX-RPC 2.0 will add support for the additional clarifications it provides.</dd>

	<dt>A Metadata Facility for the Java Programming Language (JSR 175)</dt>

		<dd>JAX-RPC 2.0 will define use of Java annotations[12] to simplify the most common development scenarios for both clients and servers. Web Services Metadata for the Java Platform (JSR 181) JAX-RPC 2.0 will align with and complement the annotations defined by JSR 181[13].</dd>

	<dt>Implementing Enterprise Web Services (JSR 109)</dt>

		<dd>The JSR 109[14] defined jaxrpc-mapping-info deployment descriptor provides deployment time Java , WSDL mapping functionality. In conjunction with JSR 181[13], JAX-RPC 2.0 will complement this mapping functionality with development  time Java annotations that control Java , WSDL mapping. Web Services Security (JSR 183) JAX-RPC 2.0 will align with and complement the security APIs defined by JSR 183[15].</dd>

	<dt></dt>

		<dd>JAX-RPC 2.0 will improve support for document/message centric usage:</dd>


	<dt>Asynchrony</dt>

		<dd>JAX-RPC 2.0 will add support for client side asynchronous operations.</dd>

	<dt>Non-HTTP Transports</dt>

		<dd>JAX-RPC 2.0 will improve the separation between the XML based RPC frame- work and the underlying transport mechanism to simplify use of JAX-RPC with non-HTTP transports.</dd>

	<dt>Message Access</dt>

		<dd>JAX-RPC 2.0 will simplify client and service access to the messages underlying an exchange.</dd>

	<dt>Session Management</dt>

		<dd>JAX-RPC 1.1 session management capabilities are tied to HTTP. JAX-RPC 2.0 will add support for message based session management.</dd>
</dl>


<p>
JAX-RPC 2.0 will also address issues that have arisen with experience of implementing and using JAX-RPC 
1.0: 
</p>

<dl>
	<dt>Inclusion in J2SE </dt>

		<dd>JAX-RPC 2.0 will prepare JAX-RPC for inclusion in a future version of J2SE. Application portability is a key requirement and JAX-RPC 2.0 will define mechanisms to produce fully </dd>
	<dt>portable clients. </dt>

		<dd>Handlers </dd>

	<dt>JAX-RPC 2.0 will simplify the development of handlers and will provide a mechanism to allow handlers to collaborate with service clients and service endpoint implementations. </dt>

		<dd>Versioning and Evolution of Web Services </dd>

	<dt>JAX-RPC 2.0 will describe techniques and mechanisms to ease the burden on developers when creating new versions of existing services. </dt>

		<dd>Backwards Compatibility of Binary Artifacts </dd>

	<dt>JAX-RPC 2.0 will not preclude preservation of backwards  binary compatibility between JAX-RPC 1.x and 2.0 implementation runtimes.</dt>
</dl>

Nokia has  released the 
<a href="http://forum.nokia.com/main/1,,1_0_10,00.html#jsr226">final  specification for  <abbr title="Java Specification Request">JSR</abbr>-226,  Scalable 2D Vector Graphics API </a>. "This API is targeted for low-end mobile devices with constraints in memory, screen size, and computational power. The goal of this specification is to define an optional API package for rendering Scalable 2D vector images, including external images in SVG format. The main target use cases of this API are map visualization, scalable icons and other applications which require scalable, animated graphics."  This is a basically a stripped down DOM/SVG-DOM subset more likely to fit into small devices than the full SVG DOM, along with a few classes for telling applications to display SVG images.

The OpenOffice Project has  posted the first beta of  <a
href="http://download.openoffice.org/2.0beta/index.html">
OpenOffice 2.0</a>, an open source office suite for Linux and
Windows that saves all its files as zipped XML. 
New features in 2.0 include a multipane view, custom shapes, 
 enhanced database frontend, mail merge wizard, nested tables, 
 digital signatures, XForms, and the ability to open and save WordPerfect files. 
OpenOffice is dual licensed  under the
LGPL and Sun Industry Standards Source License. 
</p>

<p>
I'm pretty down on OpenOffice these days. 
I used the 1.0 version to write <cite><a
href="books/effectivexml/">Effective XML</a></cite>, which was a poor choice that probably cost me months. I should have used Word.
Microsoft Word is not a paragon of usability, but it's functional, which is more than I've ever been able to say for OpenOffice.  In fact, OpenOffice invented whole new categories of "GUI Bloopers", preeminent among them, "Don't add a menu item for functionality you know doesn't work, just because you expect to get around to it sometime in the next couple of years." 1.1 was a slight improvement, but only slight. It fixed the most glaring and obvious bugs, but still didn't produce a product that allowed a writer to simply write without thinking about the interface, something Word does fairly well. 
OpenOffice might be a reasonable alternative for someone who uses their word processor infrequently enough that they're willing to put up with some pain in order to save a few bucks. However, it's clearly inadequate for those of us who write for a living. 
</p>

<p>
2.0 might be an improvement, but I don't know. These days I've almost completely 
retired my Linux and Windows systems in favor of a Mac. There's no Mac version of 2.0, and after years of telling Mac developers not to bother porting 1.x because 2.0 was going to be so much better, the development team has realized they have no plan at all for 
ever running on the Mac.  OpenOffice needs to learn the VRML lesson: you can't take over the world if you can't run on a Mac.

From the browser that wouldn't die department, 
AOL has posted the first <a href="http://browser.netscape.com/nsb/">beta of Netscape 8</a>. 
This is basically just a repackaged, reskinned Firefox 1.0, security flaws and all.
It does have the unique feature of allowing you to switch between the Gecko and IE rendering engines. 
Most users should stick to Firefox 1.0.1 or Mozilla.

I've posted the second alpha release of 
<a href="http://www.xom.nu/unstable.html">XOM 1.1</a>, my free-as-in-speech (LGPL)
dual streaming/tree-based API for processing XML with Java.
Version 1.1 maintains backwards compatibility with XOM 1.0 while adding a number of important new features including XPath support.
Alpha 2 speeds up XPath queries by roughly a factor of 10. 
It also fixes assorted small bugs, and adds an <code>XPathTypeException</code> class that 
distinguishes syntactic errors from
the case where an XPath expression returns something other than a node-set.

The W3C Internationalization GEO (Guidelines, Education &amp; Outreach) Working Group
has updated the working draft of 
 <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-i18n-html-tech-lang-20050224/">Authoring Techniques for XHTML &amp; HTML Internationalization: Specifying the language of content 1.0</a>. 
According to the draft,
"Specifying the language of content is useful for a wide number of applications, from linguistically sensitive searching to applying language-specific display properties. In some cases the potential applications for language information are still waiting for implementations to catch up, whereas in others, such as detection of language by voice browsers, it is a necessity today. Marking up language information is something that can and should be done today. Without it, it is not possible to take advantage of any of these applications.
This document is one of a series of documents providing HTML authors with techniques for developing internationalized HTML using XHTML 1.0 or HTML 4.01, supported by CSS1, CSS2 and some aspects of CSS3. It focuses specifically on advice about specifying the language of content." This advice is summarized in 16 techniques:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Technique 1: Always declare language in the html tag</li>
	<li>Technique 2: html declarations for multilingual docs</li>
	<li>Technique 3: Declare language changes inside the document</li>
	<li>Technique 4: Should I use the lang or xml:lang attribute?</li>
	<li>Technique 5: Don't use Content-Language for text-processing</li>
	<li>Technique 6: Don't use the body tag rather than the html tag</li>
	<li>Technique 7: When attribute and content are in different languages</li>
	<li>Technique 8: Use HTTP or the Content-Language meta tag for metadata</li>
	<li>Technique 9: Provide a comma-separated list of languages</li>
	<li>Technique 10: Division of multilingual docs</li>
	<li>Technique 11: Use RFC3066</li>
	<li>Technique 12: Use short language codes</li>
	<li>Technique 13: Use Hans and Hant codes</li>
	<li>Technique 14: Pros and cons of identifying the language</li>
	<li>Technique 15: Using hreflang with CSS</li>
	<li>Technique 16: Don't use flags to indicate languages</li>

The W3C XML Schema Working Group has posted the second public working drafts of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-xmlschema11-1-20050224/">XML Schema 1.1 Part 1: Structures</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-xmlschema11-2-20050224/">XML Schema 1.1 Part 2: Datatypes</a>. According to the introduction to the structures spec,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Working Group has two main goals for this version of W3C XML Schema:</p>
<ul><li>Significant improvements in simplicity of design and clarity of
   exposition <em>without</em> loss of backward <em>or</em> forward compatibility;

 </li><li>Provision of support for versioning of XML languages defined using
   the XML Schema specification, including the XML transfer syntax for
   schemas itself.</li></ul><p>These goals are  
in tension with one another. The 
Working Group's strategic guidelines for changes
between versions 1.0 and 1.1 can be summarized
as follows:</p><ol><li>Support for versioning (acknowledging
that this <em>may</em> be slightly disruptive to the XML transfer
syntax at the margins)</li><li>Bug fixes (unless in specific cases we
decide that the fix is too disruptive for a point release)</li><li>Editorial changes</li><li>Design cleanup will possibly
change behavior in edge cases</li><li>Non-disruptive changes
to type hierarchy (to better support current and forthcoming
international standards and W3C recommendations)</li><li>Design cleanup will possibly
change component structure (changes to functionality restricted to
edge cases)</li><li>No significant changes in
functionality</li><li>No changes to XML transfer syntax except
those required by version control hooks and bug fixes</li></ol><p>The aim with regard
to compatibility is that</p><ul><li>All schema documents conformant to version 1.0 of this
    specification should also conform to version 1.1, and should have
    the same validation behaviour across 1.0 and 1.1 implementations
    (except possibly in edge cases and in the details of the resulting
    PSVI);</li><li>The vast majority of schema documents conformant to version 1.1 of
    this specification should also conform to version 1.0, leaving
    aside any incompatibilities arising from support for versioning,
    and when they are conformant to version 1.0 (or are made
    conformant by the removal of versioning information), should have
    the same validation behaviour across 1.0 and 1.1 implementations
    (again except possibly in edge cases and in the details of the
    resulting PSVI);</li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
Changes in the data type spec include:
</p>

<ul>
<li> "0000" is a legal year and  values with negative years map
onto the timeline such that 
"the year 0000 is 1 B.C.E., the year –0001 is 2 B.C.E., etc."</li>
	<li>Distinction between identity and equality; for instance positive and negative zero would be equal but not identical. Think of the difference between <code>==</code> and <code>equals()</code> in Java. </li>
<li>New <code>yearMonthDuration</code> and <code>dayTimeDuration</code> types</li>
<li>A <code>precisionDecimal</code> type</li>
<li>An <code>anyAtomicType</code> data type</li>
</ul>

<p>
There are also  open issues including how to align the W3C XML schema language with XML 1.1.

The W3C  XML Binary Characterization Working Group
(a bit of an Orwellian name, that. 
The one thing that's guaranteed about this effort is that the format
it produces will not be XML.)
has published the first public working draft of
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-xbc-measurement-20050224/">XML Binary Characterization Measurement Methodologies</a>. "This document describes measurement aspects, methods, caveats, test data, and test scenarios for evaluating the potential benefits of an alternate serialization for XML. This document relies on the XML Binary Characterization Working Group (XBC WG) documents for Use Cases and Properties. The focus of this document is to provide a basis for later comparison rather than reporting of actual measurements of actual implementations. The examined and potential use cases represent existing uses that might benefit from the use of an XML-like format, if it had certain additional properties. This potential expansion of the XML community depends on the existence, identification, and evolution of solutions that cover the broadest problem footprint in the best fashion. The XBC WG Characterization document represents the working group's consensus of required and useful properties. This document discusses how fulfillment of those properties can be precisely evaluated and how combinations of properties are best compared."

<p>
The W3C  XML Binary Characterization Working Group
has also updated 
the working drafts of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-xbc-use-cases-20050224/">XML Binary Characterization Use Cases</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-xbc-properties-20050224/">XML Binary Characterization Properties</a>. The use cases document describes 18 different scenarios where a so-called binary XML format might be desirable.
I don't find most of these at all convincing. They tend to divide into scenarios that can operate just fine with traditional XML (FIXML)
and scenarios that shouldn't be going anywhere near anything the even smells of XML (Floating Point Arrays in the Energy Industry,
Supercomputing and Grid Processing). Have we all forgotten the Edsel?
</p>

<p>
The properties document is more theoretical, and discusses the different characteristics XML has and that a non-XML binary 
format might or should have. These properties include:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Processing Efficiency</li>
	<li>Small Footprint</li>
	<li>Space Efficiency</li>
	<li>Accelerated Sequential Access</li>
	<li>Compactness</li>

 The W3C 
 RDF Data Access Working Group has published the second public working draft of 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-rdf-sparql-query-20050217/">SPARQL Query Language for RDF</a>.
According to the introduction,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
An RDF graph is a set of triples, each triple consisting of a <em>subject</em>,
  a <em>predicate</em> and an <em>object</em>, as defined in
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-rdf-concepts-20040210/">RDF Concepts and Abstract syntax</a>. These triples can come from a variety of
  sources. For instance, they may come directly from an RDF
  document. They may be inferred from other RDF triples.  They may be
  the RDF expression of data stored in other formats, such as XML or
  relational databases.</p>

  <p><acronym title="SPARQL Protocol And RDF Query Language">SPARQL</acronym> <acronym title="SPARQL Protocol And RDF Query Language">&nbsp;(SPARQL Protocol And RDF 
  Query Language) </acronym>is a
  query language for getting information from such RDF graphs. It provides
  facilities to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>extract information in the form of URIs, bNodes, plain and typed 
    literals.</li>

    <li>extract RDF subgraphs.</li>

    <li>construct new RDF graphs based on information in the queried graphs.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>As a data access language, it is suitable for both local and
  remote use. When used across networks, the companion <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-protocol/">SPARQL Protocol for RDF</a> document  describes a remote access protocol.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
Here's a simple example SPARQL query adapted from the draft:
</p>

<pre>PREFIX  dc: &lt;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/>
PREFIX  : &lt;http://example.org/book/>
SELECT  $var
WHERE   ( :book1  dc:title  $var )</pre>

<p>
The <code>$</code> indicates a variable name. 
(The previous draft used a question mark instead.)
This query stores the 
title of a book in a 
variable named <code>var</code>. There are boolean and numeric operators as well.

<p>
I'm pleased to announce the first alpha release of <a href="http://www.xom.nu/unstable.html">XOM 1.1</a>, my free-as-in-speech (LGPL)
dual streaming/tree-based API for processing XML with Java.
Version 1.1 maintains backwards compatibility with XOM 1.0 while adding a number of important new features including:
</p>

<ul>
	<li> XPath</li>
	<li> a <code>setInternalDTDSubset</code> method in <code>DocType</code></li>
	<li> Document subset canonicalization</li>
	<li> Exclusive XML canonicalization</li>
	<li> <code>xml:id</code> support</li>
	<li> Parameters can be passed to XSL transforms</li>
</ul>

<p>
The XPath support is especially useful. 
You can now write declarative queries like these 
that find all the <code>person</code> elements instead of writing
of  complicated, fragile, explicit navigation instructions:
</p>

<pre><code>Nodes people = doc.query("//person");
XPathContext = new XPathContext("html", "http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml");
Nodes toc = doc.query("//html:div[@id='toc']/child::node()", context)</code></pre>

<p>
The XPath support is based on the latest <a href="http://jaxen.codehaus.org/">Jaxen</a> source code. 
This is the same engine used in JDOM and dom4j. However, before bundling this 
with XOM I fixed a lot of bugs in Jaxen, and worked around several others. 
XOM is much more conformant to the XPath specification than either JDOM or dom4j.  There's still at least one nasty bug in XPath evaluation I haven't been able to fix yet, but so far I've only seen it with an unusual, redundant union expression that's unlikely to arise in practice (<code>//. | /</code>). More importantly, there are probably other undiscovered bugs waiting to bite. If you spot any of the critters, holler and I'll try to stomp them.

Wolfgang Hoschek has released <a href="http://dsd.lbl.gov/nux/">NUX 1.0</a>,
an open source add-on package for <a href="http://www.xom.nu/">XOM</a> that connects it to Michael Kay's  Saxon 8 XSLT 2/XPath 2/XQuery processor and the Sun Multi-Schema Validator. 
It also provides thread-safe factories and pools for creating XOM <code>Builder</code> objects. 
NUX also includes yet another non-XML binary format. 
Mostly NUX addresses problems I personally 
don't find to be that important, so I haven't put them in the core of XOM. (Does the world really need yet another incompatible, 
opaque binary format for XML? For that matter, does it need even one?) However, there is one nice feature here I noticed that Hoschek hasn't emphasized: RELAX NG support for the XOM builder. Looking at the NUX API, I realize that I know how to integrate DTD and W3C XML Schema Processing into XOM, but I'm not at all sure how to integrate RELAX NG; and that's definitely worth doing. I should give some more thought to that. In the meantime, NUX can do it.
NUX is published under a modified BSD license (no advertising clause).

<li> <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-xslt20-20050211/">XSL Transformations (XSLT) Version 2.0</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Changes in XPath 2.0 in these drafts include:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
<p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-xpath-functions-20050211/#func-id"><code>fn:id</code></a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-xpath-functions-20050211/#func-idref"><code>fn:idref</code></a> functions now work on values specified as <code>xs:ID</code>, <code>xs:IDREF</code> and <code>xs:IDREFS</code> as well as the DTD types <code>ID</code>, <code>IDREF</code> and <code>IDREFS</code> and the newly-defined <code>xml:id</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-xpath-functions-20050211/#func-codepoint-equal"><code>fn:codepoint-equal</code></a> has been added that compares strings based on the Unicode code point collation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-xpath-functions-20050211/#func-doc-available"><code>fn:doc-available</code></a> function has been added to indicate whether an XML  document can be retrieved from a given URI.</p></li>
	<li><p> xdt:untypedAny has been changed to xdt:untyped. </p></li>

	<li><p> xs:anyType is no longer an abstract type, but is now used to denote the type of a partially validated element node. Since there is no longer a meaningful distinction between abstract types and concrete types, these terms are no longer used in this document. </p></li>

	<li><p> Value comparisons now return the empty sequence if either operand is the empty sequence. </p></li>

	<li><p> The typed value of a namespace node is an instance of xs:string, not xdt:untypedAtomic. </p></li>


	<li><p> The precedence of the cast and treat operators and unary arithmetic operators has been increased. </p></li>

	<li><p> A new component has been added to the static context: context item static type. </p></li>

	<li><p> The XPath 2.0 specification now clearly distinguishes between "statically-known namespaces" (a static property of an expression) and "in-scope namespaces" (a dynamic property of an element). </p></li>

</ul>

<p>
XSLT 2 specific changes in these drafts include:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A non-schema-aware
processor now allows all the built-in types defined in XML Schema to be
used; previously only a subset of the primitive types plus <code>xs:integer</code> were permitted. </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Error codes have been assigned to some error conditions that previously had no code assigned.</p>

            </li>

            <li>
              <p><code>xsl:use-when</code>
attributes can appear on  elements that are not in the XSLT namespace,
whether or not it is a literal result element. For example, it can
usefully appear on an extension instruction.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>The
behavior of certain constructs in backwards-compatible mode has changed
to more closely reflect the XSLT 1.0 behavior. Specifically:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>In backwards compatible mode, the <code>xsl:number</code> instruction now outputs <code>NaN</code> when the supplied value is an empty sequence or non-numeric, rather than signaling an error.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>In backwards compatible mode, parameters passed to a built-in template rule are not passed on.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>If
no output method is explicitly requested, and the first element node
output appears to be an XHTML document element, then under XSLT 2.0 the
output method defaults to XHTML; with backwards compatibility enabled,
the XML output method will be used.</p>
                </li>

                <li>

                  <p>An XSLT 1.0 processor compared the value of the expression in the <code>use</code> attribute of <code>xsl:key</code> to the value supplied in the second argument of the <code>key</code>
function by converting both to strings. An XSLT 2.0 processor normally
compares the values as supplied. The XSLT 1.0 behavior is emulated if
any of the <code>xsl:key</code> elements making up the key definition enables backwards-compatible behavior.</p>

                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>XPath expressions in attribute value templates are now expanded using the same rules as apply to the <code>select</code> attribute in instructions such as <code>xsl:attribute</code>.
The effect of the change is that if the value of the expression
contains several adjacent text nodes, no whitespace is inserted between
the string values of these text nodes.</p>
            </li>

            <li>

              <p>When the 3-argument form of the<code>key</code>
function is used, the search is now restricted to the subtree rooted at
the node identified by the third argument. Previously the third
argument merely identified the document to be searched.</p>
            </li>

        

            <li>
              <p>The rules for the <code>format-number</code> function have been changed so that numbers are  never output with a trailing decimal point.
(I'm not sure I like this change. It could cause problems when generating C code, for example.)</p>
            </li>

         
            <li>
              <p>The   <code>undeclare-namespaces</code> attribute has been
              renamed <code>undeclare-prefixes</code>.</p>
            </li>


            <li>
              <p>It is now a recoverable error to generate nodes in the result tree using a namespace name that is not a valid instance of <code>xs:anyURI</code>.
XSLT 1.0 explicitly stated that this was not an error; however, the
XPath 2.0 data model assumes that the name of a node is a valid <code>xs:QName</code>, and the namespace part of a valid <code>xs:QName</code>, if present, must be a valid <code>xs:anyURI</code>. The fact that this error is recoverable, however, gives implementations freedom to
              avoid strict validation of namespace names if they wish to do so.</p>

            </li>
</ul>

<p>
XQuery-specific changes in these drafts include:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>An <code>ordering</code> declaration has been added to the Prolog, which affects the ordering semantics of path expressions, FLWOR expressions, and <code>union</code>, <code>intersect</code>, and <code>except</code> expressions. In addition, <code>ordered</code> and <code>unordered</code> operators have been introduced that permit ordering semantics to be controlled at the expression level within a query.</p>

</li>

<li>
<p>Validation has been separated from construction. Validation now occurs only as a result of an explicit <code>validate</code> expression. Validation modes are <code>strict</code> and <code>lax</code>, and are specified on the <code>validate</code> expression. New construction modes <code>strip</code> and <code>preserve</code>

have been defined and are declared in the Prolog. The notion of
"validation context" has been deleted. The XQuery definition of
validation has been converged with the definition
used in XSLT.</p>
</li>

<li >
<p>Function overloading: That is, multiple user-defined functions can have the
same name as long as they have different numbers of arguments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> <code>xdt:untypedAny</code> is changed to <code>xdt:untyped</code>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Computed namespace constructors are now completely static and are
allowed only inside a computed element constructor. Namespace
declarations in a computed element constructor must come before the
element content, and must consist entirely of literals. The namespace
prefix is optional. If absent, it has the effect of setting the default
namespace for elements and types within the scope of the constructed
element.</p>

</li>


<li>
<p>The syntax for variable initialization in the Prolog now uses an assignment operator ("<code>:=</code>"). Also, circularities in variable initialization are now static errors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An error is raised if a module attempts to import itself (target
namespace of importing module and imported modules are the same).</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>A schema can now be imported without specifying either a target namespace or a location hint.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Module imports and schema imports now accept multiple location
hints, representing multiple physical resources in the same module or
schema.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CData Sections are no longer considered to be constructors, but are
simply a notational convenience for embedding special characters in the
content of an element or attribute constructor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Three new components have been added to the static context: XQuery
Flagger status, XQuery Static Flagger status, and context item static
type. (Note: Flagger status items were later deleted.)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>An <code>order by</code> clause may now accept values of mixed type
if they have a common type that is reachable by numeric type promotion
and/or moving up the type derivation hierarchy, and if this common type
has a <code>gt</code> operator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In element and document node constructors, if the content sequence
contains a document node, that node is replaced by its children (this
was previously treated as an error).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Atomization now applies to the name expression of a computed processing instruction constructor.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>It is now implementation-defined whether undeclaration of namespace
prefixes in an element constructor is supported. If supported, this
feature conforms to the semantics of Namespaces 1.1. In other words, if
an element constructor binds a namespace prefix to the zero-length
string, any binding of that prefix defined at an outer level is
suspended within the scope of the constructed element.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a computed text node constructor, the expression enclosed in
curly braces is no longer optional, since it is not possible to
construct an empty text node.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Rules for processing comment constructors have changed, to ensure
that the resulting comment does not contain adjacent hyphens or end
with a hyphen.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
For the first time in years, most of the various working drafts are now in sync. 
(The formal semantics document still hasn't completely caught up.)
Changes over all aren't major. These still aren't last call working drafts, though; and it seems unlikely the working group will finish this year. Just maybe the final versions will be released in 2006.

<p>
The W3C XQuery working group has also published the first public working draft of<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-xquery-update-requirements-20050211/">XQuery Update Facility Requirements</a>. XQuery as it currently exists is basically just SELECT in SQL terms. This is the beginning of work on INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE. This is just a list of proposed requirements for an eventual update language. No actual syntax or behavior is suggested in this draft.

In related news. Michael Kay has released version 8.3 of Saxon, his XSLT 2.0 and XQuery processor. Besides updating Saxon to cover the latest working drafts,
this release makes the dependency on JAXP 1.3 a lot softer so that 
Saxon is much easier to install and run in Java 1.4 environments.
Saxon 8.3 is published in two versions for both of which 
Java 1.4 or later is required.
<a href="http://saxon.sf.net/">Saxon 8.3B</a> is an open source product  
published under the Mozilla Public License 1.0 that 
"implements the 'basic' conformance level for XSLT 2.0 and XQuery."
Saxon <a href="http://www.saxonica.com/">8.3SA</a> is a 
£250.00 payware version that "allows stylesheets and queries to import an XML Schema, to validate input and output trees against a schema, and to select elements and attributes based on their schema-defined type. Saxon-SA also incorporates a free-standard XML Schema validator.
In addition Saxon-SA incorporates some advanced extensions not available in the Saxon-B product. These include a try/catch capability for catching dynamic errors, improved error diagnostics, support for higher-order functions, and additional facilities in XQuery including support for grouping, advanced regular expression analysis, and formatting of dates and numbers."
Upgrades from 8.x are free.

<p>
The W3C XML Core Working Group has posted the candidate recommendation
of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/CR-xml-id-20050208/">xml:id Version 1.0</a>. This describes an idea that's been kicked around in the community for some time. The basic problem is how to link to elements by IDs when a document doesn't have a DTD or schema. The proposed solution is to predefine an <code>xml:id</code> attribute that 
would always be recognized as an ID, regardless of the presence or absence of a DTD or schema. Unfortunately, it's recently been discovered that 
this is pretty badly incompatible with canonical XML, which likes to inherit attributes in the XML namespace onto descendant elements, thus moving xml:id's from one element to another. This has downstream effects on XML digital signatures and XML encryption. The working group is still trying to figure out what to do about this, and fixing may necessitate going back to last call.
</p>

<p>
The problem is really in canonical XML, which assumed that all attributes in the XML namespace would act like <code>xml:lang</code> and <code>xml:space</code>.
Unfortunately the two defined after canonical XML don't behave that way. 
(<code>xml:base</code> also turns out to be subtly incompatible with canonicalization.)
If we could go back in time, then fixing canonical XML would be the obvious choice. Hindsight's 20/20. However since we can't do that, and since canonical XML is already widely deployed,
the proposal I favor suggests using an <code>xmlid</code> attribute in no namespace instead. The working group doesn't seem to like that. I'm afraid that solution is just a little too simple for the W3C since it doesn't activate the whole namespace machinery they're so fond of.

The W3C Synchronized Multimedia Working Group has posted the first public working draft
of
the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-SMIL2-20050201/">Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL 2.1)</a>.
SMIL 2.1 has four goals:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Define an XML-based language that allows authors to write interactive
    multimedia presentations. Using SMIL, an author can describe the temporal
    behaviour of a multimedia presentation, associate hyperlinks with media
    objects and describe the layout of the presentation on a screen.</li>
  <li>Allow reusing of SMIL syntax and semantics in other XML-based
    languages, in particular those who need to represent timing and
    synchronization. For example, SMIL components are used for integrating
    timing into XHTML and into SVG.</li>
  <li>Extend the functionalities contained in the SMIL 2.0 into
    new or revised SMIL 2.1 modules.</li>
  <li>Define new SMIL 2.1 Mobile Profiles incorporating features useful
    within the mobile industry.</li>
</ul>

John Cowan has posted the second release candidate of <a href="http://www.ccil.org/~cowan/XML/tagsoup">TagSoup</a>,
an open source, Java-language, SAX parser for nasty, ugly HTML.
I use TagSoup to convert JavaDoc to well-formed XHTML. Cowan writes,
"This is not really a 'release
candidate', but rather a set of bug fixes to TagSoup 1.0rc1.  There are
still some known problems in it, but they seem to appear only in very
pathological input, like randomly generated HTML.  I decided to release
this version now in order to get the bug fixes to people who've been
asking for them.  Please upgrade and report on any problems you find."

an XML application designed for technical documentation 
and books such as <a href="books/xmljava/"><cite>Processing XML with Java</cite></a>. 
This is a "maintainance release. It introduces no backwards-incompatible changes. All valid DocBook 4.3 documents are also valid DocBook 4.4 documents.
The genesis of this release is a bug in the catalog files for DocBook V4.3. The Committee decided to produce a 4.4 release, incorporating a few recent backwards-compatible changes, rather than simply produce a 4.3.1 release to fix the bugs."
New elements in DocBook 4.4 include 
 <code>package</code>,  <code>bibliolist</code>, and <code>biblioref</code>. 
 Version 4.4 is available in XML and SGML DTDs. Unofficial RELAX NG and W3C XML schemas are also available

The W3C XML Protocol Working Group has published three final recommendations
covering XOP, a MIME multipart envelope format 
for bundling XML documents with binary data:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/REC-xop10-20050125/">XML-binary Optimized Packaging</a> "defines the XML-binary Optimized Packaging (XOP) convention, a means of more efficiently serializing XML Infosets (see [XMLInfoSet]) that have certain types of content.

A XOP package is created by placing a serialization of the XML Infoset inside of an extensible packaging format (such a MIME Multipart/Related, see [RFC 2387]). Then, selected portions of its content that are base64-encoded binary data are extracted and re-encoded (i.e., the data is decoded from base64) and placed into the package. The locations of those selected portions are marked in the XML with a special element that links to the packaged data using URIs. "</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/REC-soap12-mtom-20050125/">SOAP Message Transmission Optimization Mechanism</a> "describes an abstract feature and a concrete implementation of it for optimizing the transmission and/or wire format of SOAP messages. The concrete implementation relies on the [XML-binary Optimized Packaging] format for carrying SOAP messages." </li>
	<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/REC-soap12-rep-20050125/">Resource Representation SOAP Header Block</a> "describes the semantics and serialization of a SOAP header block for carrying resource representations in SOAP messages."</li>

</ul>

<p>
Basically this is another whack at the packaging problem: how to wrap up several
documents including both XML and non-XML documents and transmit them in a single SOAP request or response. In brief, this proposes uses a MIME envelope to do that. This is all reasonable. I do question the wisdom, however, of pretending this is just another XML document. It's not. The goal is to ship binary data like images in their native binary form, which is sensible. What I don't like is claiming that this non-XML, MIME based format is XML because one could theoretically translate the binary data into Base-64, reshuffle the parts, and come up with something that is an XML document, even though
no one will actually do that.
</p>

<p>
Why is there this irresistible urge throughout the technology community to call everything XML, even when it clearly isn't and clearly shouldn't be? 
XML is very good for what it does, but it doesn't and shouldn't try to be all 
things to all people. Fundamentally binary data such as scanned images and digitized movies
is not something XML does well, and not something it ever will do well. Render into binary what is binary, and render into XML what is text.

Cool discovery of the day: I just noticed that at the very bottom of the iTunes Music Store there's now an option to choose your country, so even though I'm in the U.S. I can now shop for music in a dozen plus countries and languages. For someone like me who prefers European pop to today's U.S. music, this is a very big deal. Right now I'm watching a German video from some band called "Rosenstolz" I've never heard of before. (Another tip: you have to pay for the songs, but the videos on the iTunes Music Store are free!) 
Some songs and videos are shared between stores, but some appear to be unique to particular stores, even in English. The French store has Marilyn Manson's <cite>Personal Jesus</cite> video, which apparently didn't make the cut at the U.S. store. (Great video, by the way. Also worth watching: Bowling for Soup - 1985, Lee Ann Womack - I May Hate Myself in the Morning, Avril Lavigne - Nobody's Home, and Eric Prydz - Call on Me. If the iTunes Music Store used a real web browser instead of custom client, I might be able to provide links to these instead of just telling you the titles.) </p>

<p>
Hmm, it looks like I can browse the stores, listen to previews, and watch the videos, but I can't actually buy music. 
 I guess Apple hasn't quite worked out whatever licensing issues were preventing them from offering music across borders. I remaining amazed at the incredible stupidity of the entertainment industry and their willingness to deliberately
turn customers paying away. Oh well. Back to Gnutella.

Ryan Tomayko has posted  <a href="http://kid-template.sourceforge.net/">Kid 0.5</a>, "a simple Pythonic template language for XML based vocabularies. It was spawned as a result of a kinky love triangle between XSLT, TAL, and PHP."
The language is based on just six attributes: <code>kid:for</code>, <code>kid:if</code>, <code>kid:def</code>, <code>kid:content</code>, <code>kid:omit</code>, and <code>kid:replace</code>; each of which contains  a Python expression. Since this expression can point to externally defined functions, this is most of what you need. In addition there are attribute value templates similar to XSLT's, and <code>&lt;?python?></code> processing instructions can embed code directly in the XML document.
I'm not sure I approve of the use of processing instructions in the language, but I'm not sure I don't either. Not having to escape XML-significant symbols like <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&amp;</code> in the embedded code is convenient. 
Kid templates are compiled to Python byte-code and can be imported and invoked like normal Python code.
Kid templates generate SAX events and can be used with existing libraries that work along SAX pipelines. 
This release changes the license from GPL to MIT.
Overall it looks like a fairly well-designed, well-thought out system that has clearly learned from the  mistakes of gnarly systems like PHP, JSP, and ASP.

The IETF has released  <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt">RFC 3986,            Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax</a>,
as an official standard (only the 66th they've published).
This replaces RFC 2396 as the official definition of URIs, and it's about time. RFC 2396 looked simple on the surface, when you started digging into it,
it became obvious that it had lots of unaddressed cases and unanswered questions. 3986 is a vast improvement. For instance, it finally
 requires that non-ASCII characters be encoded in UTF-8 prior to percent escaping, rather than whatever character set the author happens to prefer.
Given the increasing importance of URIs to everything from billboards to the semantic web, it's a wonder we've come as far as we have on such shaky foundations. 
 </p>
 <hr />
 <p>
 In addition, the IETF has issued <a href="ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc3987.txt">RFC 3987, Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs)</a>, as a proposed standard. IRIs are basically the same as
URIs except that you don't have to escape non-ASCII characters, so you can write
http://www.cafeconleche.org/reports/c&omega;.html instead of 
http://www.cafeconleche.org/reports/c%CF%89.html. A lot of XML-related specs such as XInclude either implicitly or explicitly use IRIs instead of URIs.

IBM's developerWorks has published my latest article, <a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-sxbl1/">An Early Look at sXBL</a>. sXBL is a descendant of Mozilla's XBL. The goal for it is fairly limited: really just a macro language for Scalable vector Graphics (SVG). 
However, I think it has more potential than perhaps its inventors realize, as I try to make clear in the article. In particular, I think it could become a very important stylesheet language that can take on tasks XSL and CSS just can't handle.

As if RSS 0.9, 0.91, 0.92, 1.0, and 2.0 weren't enough to deal with,
now there's <a href="http://inamidst.com/rss1.1/">RSS 1.1</a>. I think the authors are missing the forest for the trees here. While there are some small improvements in RSS 1.1 relative to RSS 1.0 (which is a completely different beast than RSS 0.9x and RSS 2.0), they are simply not outweighed by the cost of expanding market confusion and incompatibility. 
Oh well, maybe if we're lucky, this will be the straw that breaks the camel's back, and convinces the world to just move forward to ATOM leaving RSS in the dustbin of history where it belongs.

Google has <a href="http://www.google.com/googleblog/2005/01/preventing-comment-spam.html">proposed</a> using a <code>rel="nofollow"</code> attribute on <code>a</code> elements in comments and trackbacks to prevent comment spam.
At first I thought this was a very neat idea (after checking the HTML spec to see that this is indeed a valid HTML attribute, of course). On further reflection, I'm not so sure. It makes sense for trackbacks, which really aren't that relevant. However, legitimate, non-spam links in comments should not be penalized. I'm afraid blog and comment systems will simply start putting 
<code>rel="nofollow"</code> on all links, which is a tad too aggressive for my tastes. Perhaps we could allow this to be configured on a per-user basis by the site maintainer? 
Longer term, I'd really like the search engines to be smart enough to figure out what's link spam and what isn't. If Bayesian analysis works for e-mail spam it should work for comment spam too, especially since all the search engine really has to do is notice the relatively small percent of sites that attract a disproportionate number of links from comments and trackbacks.

The Mozilla Project has posted the sixth alpha of   <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla1.8a6/">Mozilla 1.8</a>.
New features in 1.8 include  FTP uploads, improved junk mail filtering, 
better Eudora import, and an increase in
the  number of cookies that Mozilla can remember. It also makes various small user interface improvements, gives users the option to disable CSS globally or on a per-page basis,
 and adds support for CSS quotes. Alpha 6 fixes a slew of bugs and adds some small features on Windows and Linux.
Most notably, it upgrades the built-in XML parser 
from Expat 1.2 to Expat 1.95.7. "Because of that upgrade, Mozilla complies better with both the XML specification and the Namespaces in XML specification. Starting with 1.8a6, Mozilla will reject some invalid XML documents that it used to accept in prior versions. This has already led to some problems with extensions that used invalid XML documents, but the only solution is to correct those documents. Here are some of the well-formedness errors that Mozilla catches since the upgrade: - Invalid entity names (for example entity names containing a colon) - Undeclared prefixes - Multiple attributes with same localname and different prefixes bound to the same namespace names - Redeclaration of reserved prefixes and namespace names."

Call Control: CCXML Version 1.0</a>. According to the spec
abstract, "CCXML is designed to provide telephony call control support for dialog systems, such as VoiceXML [VOICEXML]. While CCXML can be used with any dialog systems capable of handling media, CCXML has been designed to complement and integrate with a VoiceXML interpreter. Because of this there are many references to VoiceXML's capabilities and limitations. There are also details on how VoiceXML and CCXML can be integrated. However, it should be noted that the two languages are separate and are not <em>required</em> in an implementation of either language. For example, CCXML could be integrated with a more traditional Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system or a 3GPP Media Resource Function (MRF), and VoiceXML or other dialog systems could be integrated with some other call control systems." Changes in this draft include:</p>

 <ul>

 The W3C CSS working group has updated the working draft of
 <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-css3-speech-20041216/">CSS3
Speech Module</a>.
This  spec defines CSS properties used
when documents are read out loud. These include
<code>voice-volume</code>,  <code>voice-balance</code>,
<code>speak</code>, <code>pause-before</code>,
<code>pause-after</code>,  <code>pause</code>,
<code>cue-before</code>, <code>cue-after</code>,
<code>cue</code>, <code>mark-before</code>, <code>mark-after</code>,  <code>mark</code>, <code>voice-rate</code>,
<code>voice-family</code>, <code>voice-pitch</code>,
<code>voice-pitch-range</code>, <code>voice-stress</code>,
<code>voice-duration</code>, <code>phonemes</code>,
<code>@phonetic-alphabet</code>. This draft
aligns "the definitions with the latest version of SSML as it reached W3C Recommendation status. This effects voice-volume, voice-rate, voice-pitch, voice-pitch-range, and voice-stress, where the enumerated logical values are now defined as monotonically non-decreasing sequences to match SSML. Named relative values such as louder and softer have been dropped since they are not supported by SSML and can't be related through percentage changes to the enumeration of logical values."

The GNU Project has released <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/classpathx/jaxp/">GNU JAXP 1.3</a>, a free-as-in-speech (GPL with library exception) implementation of the Java API for XML Processing. This is the
 last release as a standalone package. In the future it  will be maintained as part of GNU Classpath. The web page is admirably written. I wish the web pages for most payware software did as good a job of explaining concisely and clearly what the product is, what it does, how to get it, and everything else a potential user needs to know. I don't think I can do better than just quote it:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

GNU JAXP provides the Ælfred2 SAX2 parser, and is configured to use
its optionally validating module by default. It includes an implementation
of the DOM Level 3 interfaces provided by the World Wide Web Consortium.
There is also a (fast!) XPath 1.0 and XSLT 1.0 implementation which supports
all options for input (source) and output (result).
These are accessible through the JAXP 1.3 and W3C DOM bootstrapping APIs.
</p>

<p>
The following W3C DOM APIs are supported:
</p><ul>
<li>DOM Level 3 Core</li>
<li>DOM Level 3 Load &amp; Save</li>
<li>DOM Level 3 XPath</li>
<li>DOM Level 2 Events</li>
<li>DOM Level 2 Traversal</li>

</ul>
<p>

</p><p>
GNU JAXP additionally provides a mostly-complete alternative implementation of
DOM Level 3 Core and XPath, a SAX2 parser, and a JAXP XSLT transformer that
use the Gnome <a href="http://www.xmlsoft.org/">libxml2</a> and
<a href="http://www.xmlsoft.org/XSLT/">libxslt</a> libraries. These
libraries, implemented in C, provide very fast parsing and transformation.
The libxmlj library, a JNI wrapper for the Gnome libraries, allows you to
leverage this speed via the JAXP interfaces. However, libxmlj is still
experimental and does not conform as well to the published SAX and DOM
conformance tests, and JNI deployment may be a barrier to entry.
</p>

<p>
At the current time, libxmlj does not support the JAXP XPath interface,
only the W3C DOM one.
</p>

<p>
GNU JAXP is not a complete implementation of JAXP 1.3. It does not currently
provide support for tree validation: the only validation available is XML
(DTD) validation by the SAX parser. We are still working on W3C XML Schema
and RELAX NG validators and the integration of the PSVI into the DOM.</p>

<p>
Java 1.4 or later is required.

	The W3C Web Services Choreography Working Group has posted the
last call working draft of <a
	href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-ws-cdl-10-20041217/">Web Services Choreography Description Language Version 1.0</a>. According to the
	abstract, 
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The Web Services Choreography Description Language (WS-CDL) is an XML-based language that describes peer-to-peer collaborations of parties by defining, from a global viewpoint, their common and complementary observable behavior; where ordered message exchanges result in accomplishing a common business goal.
</p>

<p>
The Web Services specifications offer a communication bridge between the heterogeneous computational environments used to develop and host applications. The future of E-Business applications requires the ability to perform long-lived, peer-to-peer collaborations between the participating services, within or across the trusted domains of an organization.
</p>

<p>
The Web Services Choreography specification is targeted for composing interoperable, peer-to-peer collaborations between any type of party regardless of the supporting platform or programming model used by the implementation of the hosting environment.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Comments are due by January 31.

<p>
I'm very pleased to announce the release of  <a href="http://www.xom.nu/">XOM™ 1.0</a>, a new XML object model. XOM is a free-as-in-speech (LGPL),
library for processing XML with Java. 
XOM supports a number of XML technologies including 
Namespaces in XML, XSLT, XInclude, and Canonical XML. XOM documents can be converted to and from SAX and DOM. 
XOM strives for correctness, simplicity, and performance, <em>in that order</em>. XOM is very easy to learn and easy to use. It works
very straight-forwardly, and has a very shallow learning curve.
Assuming you're already familiar with XML, you should be able to get up
and running with XOM very quickly.
</p>

<p> 
XOM is the only XML API that makes no compromises on correctness.
XOM only accepts namespace well-formed XML documents, and only allows
you to create namespace well-formed XML documents. (In fact, it's a
little stricter than that: it actually guarantees that all documents
are round-trippable and have well-defined XML infosets.) XOM manages
your XML so you don't have to. With XOM, you can focus on the unique
value of your application, and trust XOM to get the XML right. </p>

<p> XOM is fairly unique in that it is a dual streaming/tree-based API.
Individual nodes in the tree can be processed while the document is
still being built. The enables XOM programs to operate almost as fast
as the underlying parser can supply data. You don't need to wait for
the document to be completely parsed before you can start working with
it.
</p>

<p> XOM is very memory efficient. If you read an entire document into
memory, XOM uses as little memory as possible. More importantly, XOM
allows you to filter documents as they're built so you don't have to
build the parts of the tree you aren't interested in. For instance, you
can skip building text nodes that only represent boundary white space,
if such white space is not significant in your application. You can
even process a document piece by piece and throw away each piece when
you're done with it. XOM has successfully processed 
gigabyte sized documents without breaking a sweat.
</p>

<p> 
It's at least a year past when I hoped to release XOM, but the extra time has resulted in a much cleaner, more robust, faster API.
XOM is now considered to be ready for production use.
Future, post-1.0 releases should be backwards compatible with the 1.0 API for the foreseeable future.
</p>

<p>
  If you'd like to know more about XOM, I suggest starting with the <a href="http://www.xom.nu/tutorial.xhtml">tutorial</a>. 
XOM also includes a large collection of small <a href="http://www.xom.nu/samples.xhtml">sample programs</a> that demonstrate various parts of the library. 
If you're curious about why XOM is the way it is, or if you would like to suggest future directions for XOM,
you should read the <a href="http://www.xom.nu/designprinciples.xhtml">design principles</a> on which XOM is based. if you have a question about XOM that is not answered in the <a href="http://www.xom.nu/apidocs/">API documentation</a> or the <a href="http://www.xom.nu/faq.xhtml">FAQ</a>, you can ask it on the <a href="http://lists.ibiblio.org/mailman/listinfo/xom-interest">xom-interest mailing list</a>.
You do not need to be subscribed to post, but non-subscriber questions are moderated.

The Omni Group has released <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omniweb/">OmniWeb 5.1</a>, 
a $29.95 payware web browser for Mac OS X.
OmniWeb 5.x is based on the same KHTML engine safari uses so it supports the same basic functionality: XML, HTML, XHTML, and CSS but not XSLT.
(I'm hoping we'll see XSLT functionality in Safari 2 next week at MacWorld, and maybe if we're really lucky it won't require a full OS upgrade, but don't hold your breath. Since Jobs returned, Apple has a horrible track record of supporting older OS releases.)
Version 5.1 allegedly improves performance. However, the demo crashed on the <a href="books/bible3/">second page</a> I tried to load. The second time I launched it, it loaded fine. A nice feature is that the demo gives you 30 days to try it out, rather than 30 days from first launch. Handy if you just want to use it occasionally to test sites rather than as your main browser.

The W3C Privacy Activity  has posted the fourth public working draft of 
the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-P3P11-20040720/">Platform for Privacy Preferences 1.1 (P3P1.1) Specification</a>.
"P3P 1.1 is based on the P3P 1.0 Recommendation and adds some features using the P3P 1.0 Extension mechanism. It also contains a new binding mechanism that can be used to bind policies for XML Applications beyond HTTP transactions."
New features in P3P  1.1  include a 
 mechanism to name and group statements together so user agents can organize the summary display of those policies and a 
generic means of binding P3P Policies to arbitrary XML
to support  XForms, WSDL, and other XML applications.

I've posted a new release candidate of <a href="http://www.xom.nu/">XOM</a> that includes  new README and LICENSE files
and an improved Ant build file that only compiles the servlet samples 
if the servlet classes are found somewhere in the classpath. The API and behavior is unchanged. If nobody spots any major problems in this release &mdash;
what people have been finding lately have mostly been  packaging issues &mdash; I'll probably release 1.0 in a few days.

<a href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera Software</a> has posted the <a href="http://www.opera.com/download/index.dml?platform=windows&amp;ver=8.00b1">first beta</a> of
version 8.0 of their namesake web browser for Windows. However, this appears to be what was previously called 7.6. Apparently, they decided the changes were significant enough to justify a major version number. 
There are lots of little changes, bug fixes, and usability enhancements in 8.0. However major new features include speech-enabled browsing (including support for XHTML+Voice), medium-screen rendering, and inline error pages. 
Opera supports HTML, XML, XHTML, RSS, WML 2.0, and CSS. XSLT is <em>not</em> supported. Other features include IRC, mail, and news clients and pop-up blocking. 
Opera is $39 payware.
