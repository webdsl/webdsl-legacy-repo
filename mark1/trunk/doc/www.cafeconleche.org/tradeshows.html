   <dt id="id3077300"><a href="http://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/iwi06/">WEB INTELLIGENCE 2006</a>, December 18-22, 2006, Hong Kong</dt><dd><ul><li>Peer reviewed</li><li><a>Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre,</a></li><li>Sponsored by: IEEE Computer Society</li><li>Sponsored by: Web Intelligence Consortium (WIC)</li><li>Sponsored by: Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)</li></ul>
         <p>Web Intelligence (WI) has been recognized as a new direction for
scientific research and development to explore the fundamental roles
as well as practical impacts of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
(e.g., knowledge representation, planning, knowledge discovery and
data mining, intelligent agents, and social network intelligence) and
advanced Information Technology (IT) (e.g., wireless networks,
ubiquitous devices, social networks, and data/knowledge grids) on
the next generation of Web-empowered products, systems, services, and
activities. It is one of the most important as well as promising IT
research fields in the era of Web and agent intelligence.
</p>


The 2006 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence
(WI'06) will be jointly held with the 2006 IEEE/WIC/ACM International
Conference on Intelligent Agent Technology (IAT'06) and the 6th IEEE
International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM'06) for providing
synergism among the three research areas.  It will provide
opportunities for technical collaboration beyond that of previous
conferences. The three conferences will have a joint opening, keynote,
reception, and banquet. Attendees only need to register for one
conference and can attend workshops, sessions and tutorials across the
three conferences.

<dt id="id3077399"><a href="http://www.plan-x-2007.org/">Programming Language Technologies for XML (PLAN-X) </a>, January 20, 2007, Nice, France</dt><dd><ul><li>Peer reviewed</li><li>Sponsored by: ACM SIGPLAN</li></ul>
<div>
<p>
Programming language plays an increasingly important role in the  
design and implementation of future XML processing systems. The PLAN-X  
workshop provides a forum where like-minded researchers from a range of  
communities — programming languages, databases, and document processing,  
etc. — can gather and exchange ideas.
</p>
<p>
The scope of the workshop includes both theoretical and practical  
research. We seek both mature work and preliminary descriptions of exciting
work in progress.  Example topics include -- but are   not limited to -- the
following: 

</p>

<ul>
      <li>Design of programming and query languages for XML</li>
      <li>Programming in the XML data model itself (e.g., extending XQuery
      into a full-fledged programming language)</li>
      <li>Formal accounts of XML and its processors (based on logic, automata,
      variants of lambda calculus, etc.)</li>
      <li>Compilers and interpreters for XML-aware languages and optimization
      techniques</li>
      <li>Type systems, schema languages, and other constraints (e.g., keys)
      for tree-shaped data</li>

      <li>Tree automata and transducers</li>
      <li>Languages and systems that can cope with XML fragments (messages) or
      very large XML instances (beyond main-memory size)</li>
      <li>Programming language glue between browsers, web services, and
      databases</li> 
      <li>Pioneering applications of XML-aware language technology</li>
    </ul>

<h2> Adding Shows to This Calendar</h2>

<p>I will probably eventually design a form for submission of trade show listings;
but until I do if you would like a trade show listed here, please email some HTML formatted 
information about it to  <a href="mailto:elharo%40metalab%2Eunc%2Eedu">elharo@metalab.unc.edu</a>.
You should keep your description brief and to the point.  You should definitely
include dates, locations, email addresses, phone numbers, web pages and pricing.
You may also include highlights of the conference and featured speakers 
or exhibitors.  Use the examples above for ideas.</p> 

<p>Please do <strong>not</strong> include complete listings of everyone and everything that will
be at your show. The more extraneous hype I have to remove, the longer it will take 
me to list your show.  Anybody who sends me more than a couple of paragraphs
about their show will receive some propaganda from me about my commercial web
development and hosting services to assist you in setting up a Web site for
your show. In other words, this page is merely a calendar for the benefit of the
interested public.  It is not a substitute for your own advertising, on the web or
elsewhere.</p>
