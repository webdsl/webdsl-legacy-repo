Does defining a labeled bracketing, a tree structure, and a formalism for document grammars really suffice to make XML interesting or important? In some ways, of course, the answer is no; none of these is a particularly complex problem. What graduate student in computer science would regard the problem of developing a notation for serializing trees as requiring more than a weekend’s worth of work? Any competent programmer can write a program to parse any reasonably clean notation. Constraint checking is a bit more difficult, but if constraints are checked in a Turing-complete programming language, we may have a better chance of actually expressing all the constraints we would like to express.</p><p>In many other ways, however, the answer is yes; purely syntactic notation is a big step forward. XML is interesting to people who wish to exploit their data, because it provides enough commonality among documents to make possible the construction of generic tools instead of tools specialized for single notations. For those who want to spend their time working with their data, rather than building new tools, such generic tools are a great step forward. Generic syntax-directed editors, guided by nothing more complicated than a schema or DTD, make it easier to create good data. Generic tools for data validation make checking for many errors possible, and allow programmers to spend more time on processing the data and less time on checking that the input is clean. Generic browsers and display engines, supported by good style-sheet languages, make it possible to display data in multiple styles tailored for different users or processes. </p></blockquote><p>--C.

If the goal is for each server to support 1,000 concurrent users, therefore, try to avoid an event model in which each user pings the server more than once per 10 seconds, let alone one. In short, avoid a fine-grained model of code on the server responding to events at the level of mouse moves or keys typed or each time the scrollbar is dragged three millimeters because if you do, you’ll be generating about 10 events per second or two orders of magnitude too many. By the way, even if supporting only 10 concurrent users per server is acceptable, communications are often fragile, and it isn’t a great idea to be extremely fine-grained because a small rare glitch in communications can much more easily break the system.</blockquote><p>--Adam Bosworth <br />Read the rest in <a href="http://acmqueue.com/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=337&amp;page=2">ACM Queue - Learning from THE WEB </a></p></dd><dt id="quote2005December15">Thursday, December 15, 2005</dt><dd><blockquote>changing a schema (DTD, or whatever structure representation) and associated documents is quite common.

Unfortunately, sometimes the data schema emerges only after thesoftware is already in use—and the schema often changes as the informationgrows. A typical example is the information contained in the item descriptionson eBay. It seems impossible for the eBay developers to define an a priori schemafor the information contained in such descriptions. Today, all of this informationis stored in raw text and searched using only keywords, significantly limitingits usability. The problem is that the content of item descriptions is knownonly after new item descriptions are entered into the eBay database.

This comes up for things like storing the alternate text tag for an image, or noting the relationships of labels with the objects they label in on-line forms.  While a thorough examination of the file format specifically for these issues still needs to be done, much of ODF is based on standard web technologies like SMIL for audio and multimedia, and SVG for vector graphics, which have and continue to be vetted by the World Wide Web Accessibility Initiative processes.  We also know that two of the existing applications that currently read/write ODF can export Tagged PDF files in support of PDF accessibility, and Adobe has already conducted some tests to verify that accessibility across that translation is preserved (and thus must exist in the original ODF file). Finally, at this very moment the OASIS Technical Committee that created ODF is looking into forming a specific subcommittee to examine ODF for just these accessibility issues and address any shortcomings found.</p><p>This is in stark contrast to proprietary file formats like those used by Microsoft Office.  Those formats are totally opaque, with no peer review of accessibility issues possible. Thus we cannot objectively tell how well the Microsoft Office file format supports accessibility, or say whether it does a better or worse job than ODF.</p></blockquote><p>--Peter Korn <br />Read the rest in <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/korn?entry=massachusetts_open_document_and_accessibility">Peter Korn's Weblog</a></p></dd><dt id="quote2005December5">Monday, December 5, 2005</dt><dd><blockquote>In the general case, REST is XML over HTTP.

Cookie interaction fails to match REST's model of application state, often resulting in confusion for the typical browser application.</p><p>An HTTP cookie is opaque data that can be assigned by the origin server to a user agent by including it within a Set-Cookie response header field, with the intention being that the user agent should include the same cookie on all future requests to that server until it is replaced or expires. Such cookies typically contain an array of user-specific configuration choices, or a token to be matched against the server's database on future requests. The problem is that a cookie is defined as being attached to any future requests for a given set of resource identifiers, usually encompassing an entire site, rather than being associated with the particular application state (the set of currently rendered representations) on the browser. When the browser's history functionality (the "Back" button) is subsequently used to back-up to a view prior to that reflected by the cookie, the browser's application state no longer matches the stored state represented within the cookie. Therefore, the next request sent to the same server will contain a cookie that misrepresents the current application context, leading to confusion on both sides.</p><p>Cookies also violate REST because they allow data to be passed without sufficiently identifying its semantics, thus becoming a concern for both security and privacy. The combination of cookies with the Referer [sic] header field makes it possible to track a user as they browse between sites.</p><p>As a result, cookie-based applications on the Web will never be reliable. The same functionality should have been accomplished via anonymous authentication and true client-side state. A state mechanism that involves preferences can be more efficiently implemented using judicious use of context-setting URI rather than cookies, where judicious means one URI per state rather than an unbounded number of URI due to the embedding of a user-id. Likewise, the use of cookies to identify a user-specific "shopping basket" within a server-side database could be more efficiently implemented by defining the semantics of shopping items within the hypermedia data formats, allowing the user agent to select and store those items within their own client-side shopping basket, complete with a URI to be used for check-out when the client is ready to purchase.</p></blockquote><p>--Roy T.

There are almost no services that are generally considered Web services (that is use SOAP and/or WSDL) that are on the Web.  Further, Web services clients rarely see Web applications.  The attempt to unify the architectures in SOAP 1.2 with the SOAP-response MEP simply have not been deployed.  This could be because the community has not moved to SOAP 1.2, perhaps partially because of the lack of WSDL 2.0 deployment.  However, I think it is much more that Web services authors perceive little benefit in offering their services on the Web.  For example, the WS-ResourceFramework[1] and WS-Transfer[2] provide generic operations in SOAP for achieving state transfer, despite proposal such as WS-REST [3] that could have integrated the resource framework with the Web.</blockquote><p>--David Orchardon the www-tag mailing list, Monday, 13 Jun 2005 11:32:51 </p></dd><dt id="quote2005August19">Friday, August 19, 2005</dt><dd><blockquote cite="http://internet-apps.blogspot.com/2005/03/xforms-myth-myth.html">It's not surprising that XForms is raising hackles and ruffling feathers since it has the potential to displace a language that a lot of people have spent a lot of time learning and building businesses around.

Most of the information will be passed to other computers, which will do the analysis of the data, and perhaps pass that analysis on to other computers. This is a different kind of network than those that we have designed, for the most part, in the past. Without human intervention, mechanisms for finding, navigating, and interaction will need to be designed to be used by machines and software objects, not people. And machines and software have very different capabilities and skills than humans. This will require a different approach to the construction of networks. That was one of the challenges we had when designing Jini technology, which was designed around machines and software objects interacting with other machines and software objects.

People get killed over less than this. These are places where ontologies are not going to work. There's going to be arguments over them. And you've got to fall back on some other kinds of approaches.</p><p>The best place where ontologies will work is when you have an oligarchy of consumers who can force the providers to play the game. Something like the auto parts industry, where the auto manufacturers can get together and say, "Everybody who wants to sell to us do this." They can do that because there's only a couple of them. In other industries, if there's one major player, then they don't want to play the game because they don't want everybody else to catch up. And if there's too many minor players, then it's hard for them to get together.</p></blockquote><p>--Peter Norvig, Google <br />Read the rest in <a href="http://www.alwayson-network.com/comments.php?id=P7480_0_3_0_C">Semantic Web Ontologies: What Works and What Doesn't :: AO </a></p></dd><dt id="quote2005January17">Monday, January 17, 2005</dt><dd><blockquote cite="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20041230.html"><p>Since the basic question is fairly simple -- "Is my beach going to be hit by a destructive tsunami and when?" -- and the required data sources are limited, I figure we won't need a supercomputer.</p><p>The seismographs are online, we gather the data using XML, continuously crunch it using the codes I am assuming already exist, then we need the warning, which I would flash on the screen of my PC down at the surf shop using a Javascript widget built with Konfabulator, the most beautiful widget generator of all.

If Iremember rightly, there were about six back-end systems involved, and onlyone was relational. The main operational transaction system was accessed bysending an application-level CICS transaction to a mainframe. Many of theother databases were ad-hoc, for example information about recentinteractions with the telephone call centre was in Lotus Notes.</p><p>The beauty of using XML for this kind of information integration is that itallows the resulting data to have a much richer structure. This makes itmuch easier to combine the structured data with the relatively unstructured,and handle the semantic conflicts that occur: for example if two databasesrecord different phone numbers for a customer, you just capture both.
