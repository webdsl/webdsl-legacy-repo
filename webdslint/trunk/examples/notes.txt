1. Should Call be an Element or an Exp.  The issue is that Call arguments are
defined as Exps, but Call itself is an Element.  So nested Calls are impossible.

2. Changed Call to be an Exp, but reverted it, because I had to add a keyword
to allow Calls inside template bodies, since they expected Elements.

3. For VarDeclElem, had to create method Env.update() to extend an Env
in place without returning a new Env object (modifies this)

4. added EvalState to all evalX calls to simulate the monad

5. Had to add fromString to each Value type so that the right Value type
can be created out of a Request parameter.

6. Changed Env from map<identifier, value> to map<identifier, vref>
