Note that the dmdsl compiler has a dependency on the following XTC packages:

  * java-front
  * xml-front

Therefore, these packages should appear in the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable. In a standard Stratego/XT install, the following command will ensure this:

  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$HOME/.nix-profile/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH

Failing this, the compiler will report a 'No XTC registration for <XTC-Package> found'.
