DOWNLOADING

- record meta data for a diff (based on .txt,v file)
- download diffs for page


CONVERSION

- strong -> **

x escape ' in text

x- replace \n in text by space to avoid spurious newlines
  x space after links, emphasis

- internal links
  - Main/UserName -> [[user(UserName)]]
  - links to Transform/ -> pto
  - links to Sdf/ -> ???

- url is itself?
  -> not in markdown; use an extension of markdown?

- link syntax
  - links in headers and tables not processed

x leave out table of contents

x ordered lists (<ol>)

- tables
  x at least pretty-print html syntax
  x remove annotations/attributes
  - extend markdown with twiki-like table syntax?

- markdown bug: empty line in code fragment

x markdown / preprocessor bug (in Stratego/TermAnnotation):

Notice that in this example the result is not <code>Plus(5, 6){\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"}</code>. The Plus term
will have just one annotation, which is the list <code>[\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"]</code>. You can use [[twikiPage(Stratego/ListMatching)|ListMatching]] to solve 
this problem:

x AutoXT: <code>...</code>

x Stratego/BuildingProgramOptimizersWithRewritingStrategies

  x remove indentation from body text
