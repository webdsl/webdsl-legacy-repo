* Install IMP
  - Preferably from source: http://eclipse-imp.sourceforge.net/developers/
  - May require Wine:
    http://eclipse-imp.sourceforge.net/jikespg/index.html#LPG_Troubleshooting
  - Building it is probably easiest when copying the IMP jars from an existing
    (Windows) installation

* Patch the WebDSL syntax for jsglr compatibility (known bug):
  - Change the following line in WebDSL.sdf  (by default in
    ../../webdsls/trunk/src/org/webdsl/dsl/syntax/WebDSL.sdf):
       LAYOUT? -/- [\/].[\/] to 
    to   
       %% HACK: JSGLR doesn't accept this atm
       %% LAYOUT? -/- [\/].[\/]

* Build the WebDSL syntax (by default in ../../webdsls/trunk/):
  $ make syntax

* Launch the plugin Makefiles:
  $ make -C org.strategoxt.imp.metatooling
  $ make -C org.webdsl.ide.imp

* Continue building the plugins in an IMP-enabled Eclipse instance.
